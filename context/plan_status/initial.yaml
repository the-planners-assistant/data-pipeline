    Buckinghamshire Council is a new unitary authority (formed in 2020) covering areas whose last Local  
    Plans were adopted between 2011 and 2021. The most recent plan, from the former Aylesbury Vale  
    district, was adopted in 2021. That up-to-date plan, along with other inherited plans, currently  
    guide development across Buckinghamshire. However, the council is preparing a new county-wide Local  
    Plan to replace the patchwork of older district plans. In the interim, the recently adopted 2021 plan  
    provides a degree of planning certainty for part of the area, while other parts rely on older plans  
    which carry less weight. The new emerging plan aims to ensure a consistent, plan-led approach to  
    housing and growth across the whole unitary area ([What next for planning in England?

    **(Now part of Westmorland and Furness Council.)** Eden’s Local Plan was adopted in 2018, which puts  
    it right at the cusp of being considered up-to-date. As part of the new Westmorland and Furness  
    unitary (formed 2023), Eden’s plan remains the operative plan for its area until a new unified plan  
    is developed. With adoption in 2018, the plan’s policies still carry significant weight, though the  
    council will soon need to review them. There is currently no new Eden or county-wide plan in progress,  
    but Westmorland and Furness Council is expected to consolidate plans in the future. In the meantime,  
    Eden’s 2018 plan provides reasonable certainty for development control, albeit with the NPPF gaining  
    influence as time progresses beyond the five-year mark.

    place, with a draft plan withdrawn in 2022 after public opposition. As of 2023, Elmbridge has  
    published a new draft Local Plan for consultation. Until a Local Plan is adopted, Elmbridge lacks a  
    current plan-led framework, so planning decisions rely on the NPPF and older saved policies ([What next for planning in England?

    Great Yarmouth’s Core Strategy was adopted in 2015 and is now supplemented by a Part 2 Local Plan  
    adopted in 2021, which allocated sites. Together these documents provide a fairly up-to-date planning  
    framework (with the 2021 allocations being current). However, the strategic element (2015) is due for  
    review. The council is beginning work on a new Local Plan to roll forward the strategy beyond 2030.  
    As of 2025, an emerging plan is in the early stages. In practice, the presence of the 2021 Part 2 plan  
    means housing delivery is still guided by recent allocations, mitigating the risk of speculative  
    development ([What next for planning in England?

The new plan in progress will eventually replace the 2015 strategy, ensuring  
    the borough remains plan-led in the long term. For now, Great Yarmouth’s situation is relatively  
    stable due to the partial update in 2021, although a full plan update is underway to keep the strategy  
    current.

    joint plan is adopted, each borough relies on its own existing Local Plan (many of which are quite  
    old, dating back to the early 2000s). The absence of up-to-date local plans in several of these

    development to come forward ([What next for planning in England?

The emerging joint plan aims to set a coordinated housing  
    delivery strategy and Green Belt releases across Greater Manchester. Its adoption will significantly  
    improve plan-led certainty in those boroughs. Currently, however, the plan is still in draft, and the  
    authorities are in a holding position – decisions are influenced by the dated nature of existing

    decision-making relies on a mix of older local policies (many still relevant in dense urban context)  
    and the London Plan. While the borough has generally been able to direct development to brownfield  
    sites, the lack of a finalized new plan creates uncertainty, especially around higher housing targets

    The current plan is helping to deliver allocated sites and city centre renewal, but to maintain that

    Hull, albeit with recognition that the plan’s time horizon is nearing expiry.

    Kingston’s Core Strategy was adopted in 2012. A new Local Plan has been in preparation (a draft was  
    consulted on in 2019) but not yet completed. Thus, much of Kingston’s local policy is significantly  
    dated. In practice, the borough relies on the London Plan (2021) for up-to-date direction on housing  
    numbers and other strategic issues. Without an updated local plan, Kingston faces difficulty shaping  
    larger developments (e.g. in Kingston town centre and along the Thames) purely on its own terms. The  
    NPPF presumption could apply where local policies conflict with national guidance or housing supply  
    is insufficient ([What next for planning in England?

However, given London’s overarching plan, the situation is partly  
    mitigated. The council’s ability to demand infrastructure or affordable housing in line with local  
    aspirations is somewhat hampered until a new Kingston Local Plan is adopted. The plan review’s  
    completion will be important to regain full local control and certainty over development outcomes.

There is no current review underway, given the recency of the plan. Planning decisions  
    are firmly plan-led, and the NPPF’s presumption is rarely engaged due to the plan’s currency and the  
    special circumstances of National Park designation. This means speculative development is virtually  
    nonexistent, and housing delivery is managed to balance conservation and community needs as intended

    Lambeth’s Local Plan was updated and adopted in 2021. It is up-to-date and aligns with the latest

    the borough (notably high-density housing and regeneration schemes) ([What next for planning in England?

With the 2021 plan in  
    force, Lambeth has strong grounds to negotiate planning obligations and ensure development contributes  
    to local priorities (like affordable housing percentages). No new review is underway yet, as the plan  
    is recent. The plan-led approach is effective here: despite intense development interest in  
    Lambeth, the council can rely on its adopted plan to make decisions and defend against proposals that  
    don’t fit the strategy, rather than being at the mercy of speculative applications.

    including the planned Bailrigg Garden Village. The plan-led approach is strong: Lancaster can point  
    to sufficient allocated sites and policies to meet development needs, thereby fending off ad hoc

There is no immediate update in progress, although a review is legally required  
    by 2025. In the interim, the council enjoys considerable certainty in planning decisions—housing  
    delivery is being monitored against the plan and if kept on track, the NPPF presumption is avoided.  
    Overall, Lancaster’s planning is stable and proactive under the current Local Plan.

    The current Local Plan was adopted in 2023. It remains within its intended timeframe and continues to  
    guide development, providing an effective plan-led framework for housing and growth. This up-to-date  
    plan allows the council to maintain control over where development should go in line with local  
    policies. Planning decisions are therefore made chiefly on the adopted plan, offering  
    greater certainty to the community and developers. The council has begun preparing a new plan to  
    ensure policies stay current, but the adopted plan still carries full weight in decision-making until  
    any new plan is in place. Overall, the area benefits from plan-led decisions rather than ad hoc  
    speculative proposals, as an up-to-date plan is in force.

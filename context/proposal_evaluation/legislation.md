Prompt: In a complex domain like UK planning, where context depends on the interplay between multiple documents, hierarchical relationships (Act > NPPF > Local Plan > PPG), specific legal interpretations, and the nuances of a particular application - how is such a framework comprehensively structured?

Here's how the framework is comprehensively structured:

1.  **The Hierarchy of Authority (Statutory Weight):** This is the backbone.
    *   **Primary Legislation (Acts of Parliament):** Supreme. Sets the fundamental legal framework, powers, duties, and definitions (e.g., definition of 'development', requirement for planning permission). Cannot be overridden by policy or guidance.
    *   **Secondary Legislation (Regulations/Orders):** Provides the detailed rules for implementing primary legislation (e.g., DMPO detailing application procedures, GPDO defining permitted development). Legally binding within the scope set by the parent Act.
    *   **The Development Plan:** Crucial for day-to-day decision-making. Section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that applications must be determined **in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise**. The Development Plan typically includes:
        *   **Adopted Local Plan(s):** Sets out the spatial strategy, site allocations, and detailed policies for the local authority area.
        *   **Adopted Neighbourhood Plan(s):** Where made, these form part of the development plan for that specific neighbourhood area.
        *   *(Potentially other adopted documents like Minerals and Waste Plans, Area Action Plans, London Plan for London Boroughs).*
    *   **National Policy & Guidance:**
        *   **National Policy Statements (NPSs):** Have special statutory weight for NSIP decision-making under the Planning Act 2008.
        *   **National Development Management Policies (NDMPs):** (Once designated under LURA) Will have the same statutory weight as the Development Plan for the matters they cover.
        *   **National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF):** A significant **material consideration** in all planning decisions. Its weight increases significantly if the Development Plan is absent, silent, or relevant policies are out-of-date (NPPF Para 11).
        *   **Planning Practice Guidance (PPG):** Provides interpretation and guidance on applying the NPPF and legislation. It's a material consideration, but generally carries less weight than the NPPF itself or the Development Plan. Its weight depends on relevance and specificity.
    *   **Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs):** Add further detail to Local Plan policies but do *not* form part of the Development Plan. They are a material consideration, used to help interpret and apply Development Plan policies.
    *   **Material Considerations:** A broad category including anything relevant to the development and use of land in the public interest. This includes the NPPF, PPG, SPDs, emerging local plans (weight depends on stage), planning history, case law, consultation responses, site characteristics, environmental impacts, design quality, etc. Their *weight* is a matter of planning judgment for the decision-maker.

2.  **Thematic Interlinking:** Planners (and the AI) need to navigate by topic.
    *   **Issue-Based Grouping:** Information is mentally (or computationally) clustered around planning themes (e.g., Housing Delivery, Green Belt, Heritage Assets, Flood Risk, Design Quality, Biodiversity Net Gain, Climate Change Mitigation/Adaptation, Transport).
    *   **Cross-Document Mapping:** For a specific theme (e.g., "Heritage Assets"), the structure links:
        *   Relevant sections of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.
        *   The relevant chapter/policies in the NPPF (e.g., Chapter 16).
        *   Specific sections of the PPG (e.g., 'Historic environment').
        *   Relevant policies within the Local Plan.
        *   Any relevant SPD (e.g., a Conservation Area Appraisal or Design Guide).
        *   Key appeal decisions or court cases related to heritage.

3.  **Process-Driven Structure:** The framework is often accessed based on the stage of the planning process.
    *   **Pre-application:** Focus on Local Plan policies, NPPF, PPG, SPDs relevant to feasibility and design.
    *   **Validation:** DMPO requirements, local validation checklists, fee regulations.
    *   **Consultation:** DMPO requirements, Statements of Community Involvement (SCI).
    *   **Assessment:** **Development Plan policies (primary focus)**, NPPF, PPG, SPDs, consultation responses, site constraints, technical reports, case law â€“ all assessed as material considerations. Need to apply the hierarchical weighting here.
    *   **Decision:** Focus on justification against the Development Plan and material considerations, conditions (NPPF Para 56, PPG on 'Use of Conditions'), reasons for refusal linked to policy.
    *   **Appeal/Enforcement:** Appeal procedures (DMPO), enforcement powers (TCPA 1990 Part VII), relevant case law, PINS guidance.

4.  **Legal Interpretation Layer:**
    *   **Case Law:** Court judgments provide definitive interpretations of legislation and policy wording. This acts as an overlay, refining the understanding of the documents. Landmark cases (e.g., *Tesco Stores Ltd v Dundee City Council* on interpreting 'material considerations', *Hopkins Homes* cases on NPPF Para 11 and the tilted balance) are critical reference points.
    *   **Appeal Decisions:** While specific to sites, patterns in appeal decisions show how PINS/SoS interpret and weigh policies in practice, particularly newer policies or areas of ambiguity.

5.  **Application-Specific Contextualisation:** The framework is ultimately applied to a specific site and proposal.
    *   **Filtering:** Identifying *which* parts of the vast framework are relevant based on the application type (e.g., householder, major residential, change of use), site location (e.g., Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3, Green Belt), proposal details (e.g., height, materials, number of units), and issues raised (e.g., neighbour objections, statutory consultee advice).
    *   **Weighing Exercise:** The core of planning judgment involves weighing the accordance with the Development Plan against all relevant material considerations (positive and negative) to reach a reasoned conclusion.

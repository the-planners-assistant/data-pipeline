Prompt: In a complex domain like UK planning, where context depends on the interplay between multiple documents, hierarchical relationships (Act > NPPF > Local Plan > PPG), specific legal interpretations, and the nuances of a particular application - how is such a framework comprehensively structured? Specifically in London.

Here's how the framework is comprehensively structured, specifically for a planning officer working in a London Borough:

**I. The Statutory Foundation (Legally Binding):**

1.  **Primary Legislation (Acts of Parliament):**
    *   **The Ultimate Authority:** Acts like the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, Localism Act 2011, LURA 2023 etc., provide the *legal powers and duties* for the entire system. They define what development is, require planning permission, establish the need for development plans, set out enforcement powers, and dictate core procedures.
    *   **Hierarchy:** All other policy and guidance must operate *within the bounds* set by this legislation. An Act of Parliament can only be overridden by another Act or challenged in the highest courts on limited grounds.

2.  **The Statutory Development Plan (The Decisive Starting Point):**
    *   **Section 38(6) PCPA 2004:** This is the crucial legal hook. Planning applications "must be determined in accordanceance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise." This gives the Development Plan legal primacy in decision-making.
    *   **Components in London:** For any given site within a London Borough, the Development Plan *currently* consists of:
        *   **The London Plan:** The Mayor's statutory Spatial Development Strategy for Greater London. It contains strategic policies applicable across London.
        *   **The Borough's Local Plan:** Adopted by the London Borough Council, containing detailed local policies and site allocations. Must be in 'general conformity' with the London Plan.
        *   **(Potentially) Adopted Neighbourhood Plan(s):** If a Neighbourhood Plan covering the application site has been formally 'made' (adopted) following a referendum.
        *   **(Potentially) Adopted Minerals and Waste Plans:** Although London Boroughs are unitary, sometimes these specific plans might exist separately or jointly, forming part of the Development Plan for relevant applications.
    *   **Hierarchy within Development Plan:** Generally, policies within these documents are read together. Where there's a conflict, the *most recently adopted plan policy* usually takes precedence (s.38(5) PCPA 2004). However, the strategic nature of the London Plan often gives its policies significant weight even if a Local Plan policy is more recent but conflicts on a strategic matter.

**II. National Policy & Guidance (Highly Influential Material Considerations):**

3.  **National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF):**
    *   **Status:** Government's national planning policy. It is *not* part of the statutory Development Plan but is a significant *material consideration* that decision-makers must take into account.
    *   **Weight:** Its importance is heightened where the Development Plan is absent, silent, or relevant policies are out-of-date (see NPPF paragraph 11). The NPPF sets the context within which Local Plans and Neighbourhood Plans should be prepared.
    *   **Future NDMPs:** The Levelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023 introduces National Development Management Policies (NDMPs). Once designated, these *will* have the same statutory weight as the Development Plan for decision-making, potentially altering the current balance significantly.

4.  **Planning Practice Guidance (PPG):**
    *   **Status:** Web-based guidance explaining *how* to implement legislation and NPPF policy. It's a material consideration.
    *   **Weight:** Generally carries less weight than the NPPF or the Development Plan, but is important for interpreting policy and understanding expected procedures and methodologies (e.g., for calculating housing need, applying BNG, assessing flood risk).

5.  **London Plan Guidance (LPGs) / Supplementary Planning Guidance (SPGs):**
    *   **Status:** Issued by the Mayor of London to provide further detail on specific London Plan policies (e.g., Affordable Housing, Air Quality, Urban Greening Factor). They are *not* part of the Development Plan but are important material considerations.
    *   **Weight:** Can carry substantial weight in decision-making as they elaborate on statutory London Plan policies. Often treated as a key reference point by both Boroughs and the GLA.

6.  **Borough Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs):**
    *   **Status:** Prepared by the London Borough to provide further detail on its Local Plan policies (e.g., on shopfront design, specific site briefs). Cannot introduce new policies but can elaborate on existing ones. Material consideration.
    *   **Weight:** Used to help interpret and apply Local Plan policies.

**III. Procedural Requirements & Specific Controls (Legally Binding Procedures):**

7.  **Secondary Legislation (Regulations & Orders):**
    *   Documents like the DMPO, GPDO, Use Classes Order, EIA Regs, CIL Regs, Listed Building Regs dictate the *process* of planning (how applications are made, consulted on, determined) and define specific thresholds or types of control (permitted development, use classes, EIA screening). Failure to comply can render a decision unlawful.

8.  **Mayoral Referral Process (Mayor of London Order 2008):**
    *   Specific procedural layer for London, requiring certain applications (PSIs) to be referred to the Mayor, who has powers to direct refusal or take over the application. This is a legal requirement.

**IV. Interpretation & Application (Context and Judgment):**

9.  **Case Law (Court Judgments):**
    *   **Status:** Interpretations of legislation and policy by the Courts (High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court) are legally binding precedents.
    *   **Influence:** Case law clarifies the meaning of terms, the correct application of policies, the scope of material considerations, and procedural fairness. It can effectively override previous understandings of policy or guidance. Planners must be aware of relevant judgments.

10. **Appeal Decisions (Planning Inspectorate / SoS):**
    *   **Status:** Decisions on specific planning appeals. While not legally binding precedent like court judgments, they indicate how Inspectors and the Secretary of State interpret and apply policy in practice.
    *   **Influence:** Particularly useful for understanding the weight given to different material considerations in specific scenarios. Consistent appeal decisions can show a 'direction of travel'.

11. **Material Considerations (The Balancing Act):**
    *   **Definition:** Any consideration relevant to planning and the development of land. This is a broad category.
    *   **Examples:** Includes the NPPF, PPG, SPDs/LPGs, government policy statements (WMS), case law, appeal decisions, consultation responses (statutory and non-statutory), site specifics (topography, contamination), environmental impacts (noise, air quality, BNG), design, heritage impact, amenity, traffic and highways impact, flood risk, economic benefits, viability, equalities impacts, human rights, crime prevention, previous planning history on the site etc.
    *   **Application:** The decision-maker (usually the LPA, sometimes the Mayor, PINS, or SoS) must identify all relevant material considerations for a specific application, and then apply *planning judgment* to determine the *weight* to attach to each one, ultimately deciding whether they are sufficient to justify a decision contrary to the Development Plan (per S38(6)).

**Structure Summary for London:**

*   **Start with the Law:** Acts define the system. S38(6) mandates determination according to the Development Plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.
*   **Define the Development Plan:** London Plan + Borough Local Plan (+ relevant NPs/MWPs). These policies have statutory weight.
*   **Layer on National Policy:** NPPF is a key material consideration, guiding plan-making and decisions (especially with out-of-date plans). NDMPs will eventually gain statutory status.
*   **Add London Strategic Layer:** Mayor's Plan (part of Dev Plan), Mayor's guidance (LPGs - material consideration), Mayor's procedural powers (referrals/call-in - legal requirement).
*   **Incorporate Detailed Guidance:** PPG (national), SPDs (local) are material considerations providing detail.
*   **Overlay Legal Interpretation:** Case Law is binding. Appeal decisions are indicative.
*   **Acknowledge Procedural Rules:** DMPO, GPDO, EIA Regs etc. must be followed.
*   **Apply to Specific Application:** Identify all material considerations, weigh them using professional planning judgment, and balance them against the Development Plan policies to reach a recommendation/decision.

This structure ensures decisions are legally sound (based on the Development Plan and legislation), informed by national and London-specific policy/guidance, procedurally correct, and based on a reasoned assessment of all relevant factors for the specific proposal.

    *   **Human Rights Act 1998:** Relevant particularly concerning property rights (Article 1, Protocol 1) and the right to a private and family life (Article 8), especially in enforcement cases or conditions affecting amenity.

**2. National Planning Policy:**
    *   **National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF):** The government's overarching planning policy document for England. Sets out policies on housing, economy, environment, design, heritage, climate change, etc. Decision-takers must apply it as a material consideration, with significant weight given to it (especially where local plans are out-of-date). *[Note: Regularly updated, check latest version].*
    *   **National Policy Statements (NPSs):** Set out national policy for specific types of Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs) under the Planning Act 2008 (e.g., Energy, Ports, Water Resources, National Networks). These are the primary policy basis for decisions on NSIPs.
    *   **National Development Management Policies (NDMPs):** Being introduced by the LURA 2023. Once finalised and designated, these will have the same statutory weight as the local plan for decision-making on specified planning matters. They are intended to cover generic issues applicable across England. *[Note: Still under development].*

**3. National Planning Guidance:**
    *   **Planning Practice Guidance (PPG):** An extensive web-based resource providing detailed guidance on how to implement the policies in the NPPF and related legislation. Covers numerous topics (e.g., design, flood risk, housing need assessment, viability, enforcement, appeals, natural environment, plan-making, CIL, BNG). *[Note: Regularly updated].*
    *   **National Model Design Code (NMDC) and Guidance Notes:** Provides detailed guidance on the production of local design codes, guides and policies to promote beautiful and sustainable places, supplementing NPPF design policies.
    *   **Manual for Streets (MfS) / Manual for Streets 2 (MfS2):** Guidance on the design of residential streets and urban environments, promoting better street design and placemaking (though technically transport guidance, heavily used in planning).

**4. Key Secondary Legislation (Regulations & Orders):**
    *   **Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015 (DMPO) (as amended):** Sets out the procedures for handling planning applications (validation, consultation, determination periods, decision notices, appeals).
    *   **Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (GPDO) (as amended):** Specifies classes of development that can be carried out *without* needing a full planning application, subject to conditions and limitations (e.g., householder extensions, changes of use). *[Note: Frequently amended].*
    *   **Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended):** Defines various land uses into 'Use Classes'. Changes *within* the same class generally do not constitute development requiring planning permission (though the GPDO now handles many changes *between* classes). *[Note: Significant changes introduced Class E in 2020].*
    *   **Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007 (as amended):** Governs the display of advertisements.
    *   **Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (as amended):** Sets out procedures for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for certain types of development projects (Schedule 1 and Schedule 2). *[Note: To be replaced by Environmental Outcome Reports under LURA eventually].*
    *   **Environmental Assessment of Plans and Programmes Regulations 2004:** Governs Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) for plans and programmes (including Local Plans). *[Note: To be replaced by Environmental Outcome Reports under LURA eventually].*
    *   **Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended):** Sets out the detailed rules for the CIL. *[Note: To be replaced by the Infrastructure Levy under LURA eventually].*
    *   **Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications, Deemed Applications, Requests and Site Visits) (England) Regulations 2012 (as amended):** Sets out the statutory fees for planning applications.
    *   **The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Regulations 1990 (as amended):** Sets out procedures related to Listed Building Consent and Conservation Area Consent applications.

**5. Other Important National Documents/Sources:**
    *   **Written Ministerial Statements (WMS):** Ministers may issue statements that clarify or change government policy or guidance with immediate effect, often pending formal updates to the NPPF or PPG.
    *   **Chief Planner Letters:** Letters issued by the government's Chief Planner to Local Authorities providing advice, clarification, or updates on planning matters.
    *   **Planning Appeal Decisions (PINS):** While individual appeal decisions are site-specific, landmark decisions or clusters of decisions can indicate how the Planning Inspectorate and the Secretary of State are interpreting national policy and legislation.
    *   **Court Judgments (Case Law):** High Court, Court of Appeal, and Supreme Court judgments interpret planning law and policy, setting legal precedents that all decision-makers must follow (e.g., on interpretation of policy, materiality, procedural fairness, reasons).

This list provides the foundational national framework. As The Planner's Assistant, having access to and understanding the content and interplay of these documents would be essential for supporting planning officers effectively.

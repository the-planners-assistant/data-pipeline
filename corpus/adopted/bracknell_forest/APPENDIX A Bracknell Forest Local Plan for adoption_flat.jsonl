To help us achieve this we need to plan for the housing, jobs and infrastructure that we need, as well as protecting what makes this Borough a great place. This plan identifies the sites that should be developed to meet these needs and the infrastructure needed to support future growth up to 2037. It also has policies to protect and improve our valued countryside, Green Belt, heritage and biodiversity and to help us tackle the challenge of climate change. Throughout the preparation of this Local Plan, we have engaged with many stakeholders, including local residents, businesses, neighboring local authorities, statutory bodies and other agencies. Their input has helped shapes the contents of the document. The Local Plan sets out how the Borough can grow in a sustainable manner, to meet the future social, economic and environmental needs of its residents. To do this, the priority has been to make the best use of land within our existing built-up areas and the most sustainable locations. The development strategy therefore supports the continued regeneration of Bracknell Town Centre as the most sustainable location in Bracknell Forest. It also aims to meet the needs for housing, including increasing the proportion of affordable housing from new developments, and providing the right employment space, prioritising the use of previously developed land. Planning for the future of the Borough is about meeting needs for built development, and at the same time safeguarding and improving the Borough's historic environment, natural assets and green spaces that residents enjoy and that are so important to our quality of life. The plan includes policies to mitigate and adapt to climate change, not just by requiring lower carbon developments, but also by promoting sustainable travel and requiring tree planting, landscaping, sustainable drainage and extensive areas of open space as part of new developments. Its policies will also raise the bar for design and landscaping. We will continue to work with our communities to develop new and innovative ways of creating attractive vibrant places where people will want to live, work and spend their leisure time. The Local Plan provides the framework to achieve this. Finally, I extend my thanks to the officers of Bracknell Forest Council, who have worked diligently on this Local Plan these past 9 years. I also offer my thanks to my predecessor, Chris Turrell, who served as Executive Member from 2013 to 2023.

In particular the BFLP: sets out the strategy for the level and distribution of development in the Borough; allocates sites for specific uses, including housing and economic development; and includes policies to be used in determining planning applications. 2.2 Upon adoption, the BFLP replaced a number of older Development Plan Documents, including the Bracknell Forest Borough Local Plan (2002) and the Core Strategy (2008). However, some of the policies in the Site Allocations Local Plan (2013) (SALP) are still relevant and have not been superseded, as they include sites allocated for development that are still to be developed. Policy NRM6 of the South East Plan which deals with the Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area also remains. Policies that have been superseded or retained are set out in Appendix 7: 'Policies replaced by policies in the Bracknell Forest Local Plan' 2.3 A Joint Minerals and Waste Plan (2023) covers Bracknell Forest, Reading Borough, the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead and Wokingham Borough. It was adopted in 2023 and covers the period up to 2036. It should be read with this Plan. 2.4 The Council's Development Plan Documents are available to view on the Bracknell Forest website. [(1)] Structure of the document 2.5 Part 1 of the document includes the vision, objectives and strategic policies that set out the overall strategy, levels of need for new development in the Borough and how they are to be met. Part 2 of the document includes the more detailed development management policies which are used to assess planning applications along with relevant policies in Part 1. Linked policy boxes are included to cross refer to closely related policies in both parts of the BFLP. However, all policies should be read together. Policies Map 2.6 The Policies Map has been updated and can be viewed on the Council's website [(2)] . Inset maps are available in the appendices. Neighbourhood planning 2.7 Local communities have the power to prepare their own neighbourhood plans and directly influence new development in their local area. Once ‘made’ a neighbourhood plan forms part of the Development Plan. 2.8 Neighbourhood plans must be in general conformity with the strategic policies in a local plan but can identify more housing and employment than a local plan, provided that the proposals satisfy national policy and environmental requirements. 1 https://www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/planning - and - [building](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy/development-plan) - control/planning/planning - policy/development - plan 2 https://www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/planning - and - [building](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy/development-plan) - control/planning/planning - policy/development - plan 16 2.9 Paragraph 67 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), makes it clear that strategic policies should set out a housing requirement for each designated neighbourhood area that takes into account the overall spatial strategy, scale of development and any relevant allocations. Section 6.2 'Sites allocated for residential/mixed use development' therefore provides a breakdown of the overall plan requirement for each designated area. 2.10 Policies in neighbourhood plans work alongside, and where appropriate replace, non-strategic policies in a local plan where they overlap. The policies within a neighbourhood plan only apply to the specific area covered by that plan. 17 3: Context 3.1 The Local Plan was prepared having regard to local, regional and national plans and strategies which relate to the future development of the Borough, the characteristics of Bracknell Forest, extensive stakeholder engagement, consultation and evidence. National Planning Policy and Regulations 3.2 The Local Plan was examined against the NPPF [(3)] published in September 2023. The NPPF explains that the purpose of the planning system is to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development', which comprises economic, social, and environmental aspects. Policies in the NPPF are supported by more detailed guidance in Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) [(4)] . 3.3 A local plan should be aspirational, yet realistic, and set out strategic policies to deliver the following: The homes and jobs needed in the area. Retail, leisure and other commercial development. Infrastructure for transport, waste management, water supply, waste water, flood risk, and the provision of minerals and energy. Community and cultural infrastructure and other local facilities, including health provision. Climate change mitigation and adaptation, conservation and enhancement of the natural and historic environment, including landscape. 3.4 A local plan must meet legal requirements [(5)] and be consistent with the principles in the NPPF. The Inspectors' Report issued at the conclusion of the Examination, found that with Main Modifications, the Plan was sound, legally compliant and capable of adoption. Evidence base 3.5 The Local Plan must be supported by up to date evidence. An overview of the evidence prepared to inform the Local Plan is provided on the Bracknell Forest website [(6)] . A glossary and acronyms are included (Section 1: 'Acronyms' and Appendix 8: 'Glossary'). Sustainability Appraisal and Habitat Regulations Assessment 3.6 A Sustainability Appraisal (SA), incorporating Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), was undertaken alongside the preparation of the Local Plan. The Appraisal tested the overall planning strategy and different policy approaches and allocations against social, economic and environmental objectives to identify which options were the most sustainable. It set out the likely significant economic, environmental and social effects and suggested measures to minimise any negative effects and maximise the positive ones. A Habitats Regulation Assessment of the BFLP was also prepared. This assessment identified any aspects of the BFLP that had the potential to cause likely significant effects on the integrity of habitats sites (Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), Special Protection Areas (SPAs) and Ramsar sites), either in isolation or in combination with other plans and projects and agreed an appropriate avoidance and mitigation strategy where such effects were identified. 3 [https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20230929144819/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20230929144819/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2) - planning - policy - framework -- 2 4 [http://planningguidance.communities.gov.uk/](http://planningguidance.communities.gov.uk/) 5 Local Planning Regulations: [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/767/regulation/18/made](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/767/regulation/18/made) 6 https://www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/planning - and - building - [control/planning/planning](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy/development-plan/draft-bracknell-forest-local-plan/evidence-base) - policy/development - plan/draft - bracknell - forest - local - plan/evidence - base 18 Other Plans and Strategies 3.7 In producing the Local Plan, the Council paid regard to other plans and strategies produced by itself and others. These included the Council Plan 2023 to 2027 [(7)] which sets the Council’s priorities up to 2027 and the Thames Valley Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) Strategic Economic Plan (supplemented by the Recovery and Renewal Plan) [(8)] which identifies economic growth priorities across Berkshire. Cross boundary issues and partnership working 3.8 In preparing the Local Plan, the Council has worked with the required bodies to co-operate on planning related issues that cross administrative boundaries (known as the ‘duty to co-operate’). Some of the evidence was also prepared jointly with other Berkshire Authorities. The Council produced a Duty to Co-operate Framework [(9)] setting out the bodies it would engage with and on which issues. Reporting on the Duty to Co-operate process occurs through the production of a monitoring report [(10)] . Development Plan 3.9 The BFLP replaced a number of existing planning policies upon adoption (details of which policies were replaced can be found in Table 19 'Policies replaced by policies in the Bracknell Forest Local Plan' . The Council's current Development Plan Documents are available to view on the Bracknell Forest website [(11)] and comprise of the following: Bracknell Forest Local Plan (2024) Retained policies in the Site Allocations Local Plan (2013) South East Plan - Policy NRM6 that deals with the Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area Central and Eastern Berkshire Joint Minerals and Waste Plan (2023) Made (adopted) Neighbourhood Development Plans prepared by local communities. 3.10 Together, policies in these plans, address the strategic issues listed in the paragraph above. Portrait of Bracknell Forest 3.11 Bracknell Forest lies 40km west of London, in the heart of the Thames Valley, within the County of Berkshire.The Borough abuts a number of other local authorities. It benefits from good transport connections, with direct access to both the M3 and M4. It has direct rail connections to London Waterloo/Reading (from Bracknell and Martin's Heron stations), and to Reading/Redhill/Gatwick (from Crowthorne and Sandhurst stations). 7 https://www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/council - and - [democracy/strategies](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/strategies-plans-and-policies/council-plan-2023-2027) - plans - and - policies/council - plan - 2023 - 2027 8 Available to download at [http://www.thamesvalleyberkshire.co.uk/documents?folder=192](http://www.thamesvalleyberkshire.co.uk/documents?folder=192) 9 Available to download at https://www.bracknell - [forest.gov.uk/comprehensive](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/comprehensive-local-plan/evidence-base) - local - plan/evidence - base 10 https://www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/planning - and - building - [control/planning/planning](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy/monitoring/other-monitoring-and-data) - policy/monitoring/other - monitoring - and - data 11 https://www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/planning - and - [building](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy/development-plan) - control/planning/planning - policy/development - plan 19 on 'Map 2 Parish boundaries, defined settlements and designated Employment Areas within Bracknell Forest', together with the extent of the defined settlements. These include Crowthorne and Sandhurst in the south, Winkfield Row (north and south), Chavey Down, North Ascot in the north east, Binfield in the north west, Hayley Green in the north and Bracknell Town in the centre of the Borough. Parts of the northern and eastern parishes lie within the Metropolitan Green Belt. The southern part of the Borough contains a number of institutions (Broadmoor Hospital, Crowthorne; Wellington College, Crowthorne; and the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst). 3.13 Bracknell is the main urban area in the Borough. Following its New Town designation in 1949, it developed rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s structured on a number of neighbourhoods each with its own centre including shops, a primary school, a community centre, a public house and in some instances a church. Great importance was attached to the provision of open space. The town centre and employment areas were segregated from the residential neighbourhoods. While Bracknell has expanded further over the years, its New Town origins are still evident. 3.14 Until the regeneration of Bracknell Town Centre commenced with the construction of a new supermarket and The Lexicon, there had been little development since the 1980s, when Princess Square Shopping Centre was completed. The mix of uses, urban environment and floorspace did not meet modern requirements and aspirations. Work on The Lexicon scheme began in 2013 and was completed in the autumn of 2017. It provides retail and leisure facilities, including new public spaces. In addition to the retail offer in Bracknell Town Centre, Crowthorne 20 and Sandhurst fulfil roles as district centres, supported by other local centres across the Borough. There are also three main employment areas located around Bracknell town and two in the southern part of the Borough (see Map 2). 3.15 Bracknell Forest has a rich and varied landscape, containing a wide range of habitats, which support a diversity of plants and animals and over 20 percent of the Borough is protected by designations, including European and nationally designated sites such as the Thames Basin Heaths SPA, and Windsor Forest and Great Park SAC. The Borough also has a diverse range of heritage assets including listed buildings, scheduled monuments and historic parks and gardens. 21 22 Key Facts about the Borough 3.16 The 2021 Census identified the following: 124,600 people were permanent residents in the Borough. The population was younger than the national average (a mean age of 39 years compared to 40 in England) but with an increasing proportion of older people in the Borough (15% aged over 65 compared with 12% in 2011). There were 50,248 households with an average size of 2.4 people (2.41 in 2011). A relatively high proportion of properties were owner-occupied 68.5% (compared to a national average of 61.4%). Terraced housing was the most common type of accommodation (28.8%) although flats/apartments/maisonettes had increased from 19% in 2011 to 20.9%. Car ownership was high with 88.4% of households owning one or more cars (compared to a national average of 77%). 69.5% of the 16-74 age group were economically active (compared to 60.9% nationally). There was a higher than average proportion of managers, directors, senior officials and professional occupations and a lower than average proportion of elementary occupations, machine operators and skilled trades. The health of residents was generally good, with 86.9% of people judging their own health to be ‘very good’ or ‘good’ (compared to the national figure of 81.7%). 23", "level": 1, "path": ["Introduction"], "tokens": 2294, "source": "APPENDIX A Bracknell Forest Local Plan for adoption"}

It has been informed by: National planning policy Other plans and strategies Key pieces of evidence Views expressed by organisations and individuals during the preparation of this Plan. National planning policy 5.2 The NPPF says that local plans should contribute to achieving sustainable development and include positive plans for the development and infrastructure required in an area in co-operation with neighbouring authorities. It highlights the need to create the conditions in which businesses can invest, expand and adapt, and, the requirement to maximise the contribution from previously developed land together with using land more effectively. Other plans and strategies 5.3 The Council Plan sets out priorities and guides activities across the Council. Following a change in administration as a result of the 2023 local election, a new Council Plan covering the period 2023 - 2027 was published in 2023. Whilst much of the preparatory work on this Local Plan was guided by the content of the 2019 - 2023 Council Plan, the overall approach to growth is compatible with the themes of the current Council Plan. Regard has also been paid to the strategies and plans of other organisations. Key pieces of evidence 5.4 The scale of growth that is required during the plan period is informed by a number of studies including the following: The Local Housing Need (LHN) conducted using the standard method in national planning guidance and the Housing Needs Assessment [(12)] which set out the housing needs, including the overall number of dwellings, scale of affordable housing, size and type of dwellings and the needs of specific groups. The Employment Land Needs Study [(13)] which sets out the scale of provision needed for future business, industrial and storage floorspace. 12 http://consult.bracknell - [forest.gov.uk/file/5819854](http://consult.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/file/5819854) 13 http://consult.bracknell - [forest.gov.uk/file/5643472](http://consult.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/file/5643472) 29 The Strategic Housing and Economic Land Availability Assessment (SHELAA) [(14)] which identifies potential land for development and assesses its suitability, availability and achievability. The SA [(15)] is also a key piece of evidence. The SA process has included identifying a number of policy options for how the Borough should develop, and in particular where development should happen. Constraints 5.5 The Borough contains a number of physical and environmental constraints which influence the location of development, including the key constraints shown in Map 3.These include areas liable to flood, habitats sites (the Thames Basin Heaths SPA and Windsor Forest and Great Park SAC) and the Metropolitan Green Belt. 14 https://www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/planning - and - building - [control/planning/planning](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy/development-plan/draft-bracknell-forest-local-plan/evidence-base) - policy/development - plan/draft - bracknell - forest - local - plan/evidence - base 15 https://www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/planning - and - building - [control/planning/planning](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy/development-plan/draft-bracknell-forest-local-plan/evidence-base) - policy/development - plan/draft - bracknell - forest - local - plan/evidence - base 30 Map 3 Key Constraints 31 The Strategy 5.6 In seeking to achieve sustainable development, the strategy generally reflects the size, character, facilities and services available in existing settlements. Key aims of the strategy are meeting future housing needs, stimulating economic growth and delivering further infrastructure where needed whilst mitigating and adapting to climate change and protecting the natural and historic environment. Bracknell 5.7 The principal settlement in the Borough is Bracknell, which is where the majority of the Borough’s population lives. It has expanded rapidly since being designated as a New Town, the built-up area now extending into some of the adjoining parishes. Further residential and economic development is already committed on a range of sites, including some that were allocated through the SALP and are in the process of being developed, such as Land at Warfield. It is the most sustainable area in the Borough being the most accessible and containing the greatest range of facilities and services. 5.8 The redevelopment of large parts of Bracknell Town Centre to create The Lexicon has resulted in substantial improvements in the overall shopping and leisure experience and has stimulated the evening economy. There has also been a significant increase in the amount of residential accommodation in the Town Centre as a result of the redevelopment and conversion of lower quality office buildings. These developments have been supported by improvements to the public realm and transport infrastructure including the enhancement of footpaths, cycleways and car parks together with major highway improvements to roads such as Millennium Way. 5.9 This Plan proposes further developments in and around Bracknell Town Centre on sites allocated for mixed use development. These involve maximising the effective use of previously developed land (PDL) and underutilised land. They provide opportunities to improve linkages and supplement the current offer with complementary and innovative forms of floorspace.They will help Bracknell Town Centre respond to change and the need to have a character and offer that distinguishes it from other competing centres. It is envisaged that proposed economic development will include some office floorspace, in accordance with national policy, which treats offices as a main town centre use. Whilst the appeal of the area as a location for office development has declined in recent years, this has been primarily due to the poor environment which has now been addressed through the regeneration scheme. The enhancement of the public realm, introduction of a greater mix of uses, including leisure and entertainment, together with improved linkages resulting from the ongoing regeneration scheme, have already increased the appeal of the area as a location for office development. 5.10 A strategic greenfield site at Beaufort Park is also proposed as an urban extension on the south western edge of the settlement for comprehensive, well-designed development. It is envisaged that this will be aimed at providing family-orientated housing to supplement the supply through the SALP allocations. It will balance the provision of smaller units to be constructed on sites in and near the town centre. Other smaller allocations within the wider built-up area of Bracknell and on its periphery will add to the short-term supply. 5.11 There are also three established concentrations of employment floorspace to the west, east and south west of the Town Centre that are designated as employment areas. They are important in providing space for more extensive industrial, storage and distribution uses. They are accessible from both the strategic road network and local residential neighbourhoods whilst 32 being sufficiently segregated from them to minimise the possibility of conflict between uses. Due to the dated nature of some of the buildings, it is likely that there will be opportunities to intensify the use of these areas, which already include some clusters of similar activities. 5.12 Despite the development that has taken place over the last few years, much of the layout of Bracknell still follows the principles that guided its development as a New Town. This is based around a series of residential neighbourhoods each with a local centre with valued community facilities and shops together with good access to extensive greenspaces. Responses to consultations during the preparation of this Local Plan highlighted the importance of retaining these features. Policies in the Plan will help respect the physical form and identity of these neighbourhoods. Crowthorne and Sandhurst 5.13 These settlements do not have as wide a range of services and facilities as Bracknell. However, they are sustainable locations providing employment, retail, education, health, access to public transport including buses, access to two train stations on the Reading to Gatwick Line and other community facilities. It is important that the viability and vitality of their centres are supported to help maintain the functionality of the area. Whilst options for growth in these centres are limited, there may be small scale opportunities for intensification and extensions where appropriate. This would assist in ensuring that suitable floorspace is available to allow centres to adapt and meet the changing needs of local communities. Other Local Centres in the settlements are also important in helping to meet the day to day needs of local residents. They are within walking distance of many residents and therefore help reduce the need to travel. 5.14 Two strategic allocations were identified for growth as urban extensions to Crowthorne through the SALP. The former Transport Research Laboratory site (now known as Buckler’s Park) is under construction providing a full range of house types and sizes including a care home. This site and land at Broadmoor will provide a significant amount of housing during the plan period. 5.15 Locally, there are environmental and physical constraints that impact on possible locations for further growth. For example, land in the south eastern part of the Borough forms part of the Thames Basin Heaths, which is a SPA. There is an 'exclusion zone' restricting residential development within 400m of the SPA. One greenfield site at Derby Field (in the Parish of Crowthorne) was submitted for consideration through the SHELAA. It adjoins the built-up area of Crowthorne, to the west. This is allocated for a comprehensive well designed development which is in a highly sustainable location adjacent to the railway station and near to a Local Centre (Station Parade) and other services. It is also near Wellington Business Park which together with Vulcan Way, Sandhurst are designated as Employment Areas, as shown on the Policies Map. The location of these settlements in the southern part of the Borough means that residents are likely to access certain key services, such as a main hospital, outside the Borough. Binfield and North Ascot 5.16 Binfield provides a range of basic facilities such as convenience stores and services within a Local Centre that meet the everyday needs of local residents and people living in hamlets and scattered development in the surrounding rural area. Whilst a number of sites were allocated through the SALP in the Parish of Binfield, the largest form urban extensions to the wider built-up area of Bracknell. However, due to their proximity to the settlement of Binfield, supporting infrastructure being provided as part of these developments is likely to be accessed by residents of Binfield. One example is the new community and health hub adjacent to Kings 33 Academy School. One smaller site (south of Forest Road/east of Cheney Close) is being allocated through this Plan which will form a small extension to the settlement of Binfield. This will add choice and variety in the housing market in this part of the Borough and help maintain the vitality of the community. 5.17 North Ascot straddles the boundary between Bracknell Forest and the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead.The higher density areas where basic facilities and services tend to be located are within Bracknell Forest. Whilst these meet everyday needs, residents also benefit from being in close proximity to the larger centre of Ascot which has a more diverse range of retail and other services, including a railway station. This is subject to further growth proposals focused on the High Street and its immediate vicinity, in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead’s Borough Local Plan [(16)] . Whilst the extension of North Ascot beyond its existing boundaries is highly restricted by Green Belt policy, development is acceptable in principle within the defined settlement and opportunities may arise for further intensification and redevelopment. Hayley Green, Winkfield Row (North and South) and Chavey Down 5.18 These settlement areas have a limited range of services and inevitably draw upon those located in other nearby parts of Bracknell. There is a need to maintain and enhance the infrastructure available to make these communities more self-sufficient. Two small greenfield sites are being allocated, one on the northern side of Hayley Green and another on the western side of Winkfield Row (South). These developments will help support existing infrastructure such as public transport. The provision of affordable housing alongside market housing will assist diversity in these areas. Other land within the Plan area 5.19 Despite the development that has already occurred and the sites that are planned to be developed, there is a significant amount of land with a rural character. Land in the countryside 5.20 A large swathe of land in the south eastern part of the Borough forms part of the Thames Basin Heaths SPA. Fragile bands of countryside remain to the west, east and north of the settlements of Bracknell and Binfield. This land is characterised by small villages, hamlets and scattered development that vary in scale and character reflecting their natural setting and historical development. Certain parts also play a significant role in separating and securing the distinctive character and setting of individual settlements and local communities. Land within the Green Belt 5.21 Land in the northern and eastern parts of the Borough forms part of the Metropolitan Green Belt. Development within these areas is restricted in line with national planning policy. Specific locations in certain villages within the Green Belt have been identified where infill development may be acceptable. 16 Borough Local Plan 2013 – 2033 Adopted 2022: Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead 34 Neighbourhood planning 5.22 Local communities have the power to prepare their own neighbourhood plans and to identify and respond to planning issues that are important locally such as the particular characteristics of an area that residents might want to protect. Once ‘made’ a neighbourhood plan forms part of the development plan and its policies sit alongside other policies in documents comprising the development plan for the area, including this Plan. Collectively, these policies form the basis for determining planning applications in the neighbourhood areas. National planning policy requires local plans to set out a housing requirement for designated neighbourhood areas. In this case, all the Borough’s outstanding housing need is to be met through existing commitments, sites allocated for development in this Plan and ‘windfall’ development. There is no requirement for further housing development to be allocated in neighbourhood plans and this is reflected in the allocation policy of this Plan. 5.23 The Council will expect communities preparing or reviewing neighbourhood plans, to consider local needs (based on evidence) and to address them in their plans where possible whilst respecting the overall strategy set out in this Plan. 35 36 37 38 39 5.24 The key diagram summarises the Spatial Strategy in graphical form. 5.25 The principles set out above will guide the distribution of growth.A range of development proposals will be submitted for consideration during the plan period through the development management process. 5.26 The Spatial Strategy outlined above will be pursued in the assessment of planning applications against the locational elements of the strategic policies, particularly Policy LP 2 'Settlement hierarchy'. KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (paras 7 - 9, 20 - 23 and 28) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications 40 5.2 Settlement hierarchy Settlement hierarchy 5.27 A settlement hierarchy ranks settlements according to their size and range of services and facilities. The relative sustainability of settlements has influenced the Spatial Strategy and allocations in this Plan. The settlement hierarchy is used to inform decisions about other developments that come forward on unallocated sites to assist in delivering the ‘Vision’ and objectives of the Plan. 41 5.28 The classification of settlements within the hierarchy is based on both their existing characteristics and their future role through the plan period, taking account of planned development referred to in the Spatial Strategy.The settlement boundary shown on the Policies Map includes the developable areas of allocated sites. 5.29 To ensure that the principles of sustainable development are achieved across the plan area, the highest priority is to focus development on the settlement of Bracknell reinforcing its role as a primary town centre and supporting the continuing regeneration of Bracknell Town Centre. Although much of the growth will be through sites allocated in this Plan, opportunities will arise for further intensification or renewal of existing sites and appropriate infill. Sandhurst and Crowthorne also have substantial populations and contain a number of key facilities and services. It will be important to support the District Centres of Crowthorne and Sandhurst. The level of growth directed to these settlements through site allocations reflects 42 their more limited role than Bracknell. Opportunities for further proportionate development will be supported on unallocated sites in defined settlements that may come forward, subject to other policy considerations. 5.30 Settlements listed in Tiers 3 and 4 have lower sustainability than higher tiers. However, Binfield and North Ascot have important roles in meeting the day to day needs of residents and communities in the local area. Apart from the allocations in this Plan, small scale development may be appropriate on sites that become available within the defined settlement areas which will help maintain infrastructure and help these communities to thrive. Further development proposals should be assessed accordingly within the confines of the settlement. 5.31 Other land outside the boundaries of the settlements listed in Tiers 1-4 is notated as ‘countryside’ or ‘Green Belt’ on the Policies Map. It is predominantly used for agriculture, woodland and outdoor recreational uses. It can assist in helping to retain the setting and individual identities of settlements. KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (paras 7 - 9) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. 43 5.3 Sustainable development principles 5.32 The NPPF provides a guide to sustainable development at the national level and the Local Plan demonstrates what this means for the Borough. This is important due to the level of growth that must be delivered and the need to ensure that it addresses economic, environmental and social considerations.The following policy reflects the 'Vision' and objectives of the Local Plan and sets out the framework for the more detailed policies in the remainder of the Plan. 44 5.33 Paragraph 7 of the NPPF advises that the purpose of the planning system is to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development. No single development proposal is likely to deliver benefits equally in terms of economic, social and environmental impacts. However, setting out the expectations for all development will ensure that all three aspects are taken into account.The principles in Policy LP 3 'Sustainable development principles' should be balanced through the development process and in practice could contribute as described below. 5.34 Economic: By ensuring that sufficient land and buildings come forward to meet local needs for housing and as far as possible, for employment uses. By ensuring that the right type and size of buildings are delivered to help meet the needs of local businesses and new investors. This includes supporting proposals that: add to the diversity of jobs, help form clusters of adjacent technologies and industries, and encourage main town centre uses (particularly community, cultural and leisure uses) in town centre locations to strengthen the local economy and help secure their vitality and viability. By ensuring that the density of proposals is appropriate and that land is used in an efficient way, taking account of the character of the area.This will include seeking higher densities in and around Bracknell Town Centre as part of the continuing regeneration project. By identifying the need for new infrastructure and working to ensure that it is provided in a co-ordinated way at appropriate times. 45 5.35 Social: By providing a supply of housing, including affordable homes of an appropriate mix and type to meet the needs of existing and future residents. This will include the provision of specialist accommodation for the increasing proportion of older people, where appropriate. By protecting existing and providing essential new infrastructure, services and facilities that meet the needs of existing and future residents. This could include additional health facilities, educational facilities, footpaths/cycleways, open space and recreational facilities, all of which can make an important contribution to the health and wellbeing of communities. 5.36 Environmental: By creating a high-quality distinctive built environment that takes account of the character of urban and rural landscapes. By conserving and enhancing the significance of buildings, sites and features of archaeological and historic interest, together with their settings. By the prudent use of natural resources and minimising carbon or energy impacts associated with development. This might include giving consideration to the juxtaposition of uses and the appropriate siting, orientation and design of new buildings together with the use of renewable energy. By ensuring better integration of transport and land use planning to reduce the need to travel. By promoting development in locations that minimise the need to travel and maximise opportunities to travel by the most sustainable modes. This might be sought through improvements to infrastructure for walking, cycling and public transport. By encouraging the efficient use of land and the re-use of PDL, as far as possible. By mitigating and adapting to climate change through careful planning and design of development, including reducing the risk of flooding from all sources. By preventing pollution through the provision of adequate wastewater infrastructure and securing mitigation where there is a risk of a reduction in air quality, increased levels of noise or intrusion from artificial lighting. By protecting areas of importance for nature conservation and taking opportunities to extend the networks of green infrastructure and provide a net gain in biodiversity. KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (paragraphs 7-9) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. 46 6: Housing 6.1 Provision of housing Housing need 6.1 The NPPF states that ‘to determine the minimum number of homes needed, strategic policies should be informed by a LHN assessment, conducted using the standard method in national planning guidance [(17)] . It adds that ‘in addition to the local housing need figure, any needs that cannot be met within neighbouring areas should also be taken into account in establishing the amount of housing to be planned for'. 6.2 Details of the standard method for establishing the LHN are set out in the Housing and Economic Needs Assessment section of the PPG. Using the 2014-based household projections [(18)] and an uplift based on the ratio of house prices to workplace-based earnings [(19)] the LHN for Bracknell Forest is 614 dwellings per annum, using a baseline of 2020. |Table 3 Calculation of Local Housing Need for Bracknell Forest|Col2| ||| |MHCLG/DLUHC Standard Method Housing Need Calculation|| |1.

Hart and Surrey Heath are part of the Hart/Rushmoor/Surrey Heath Housing Market Area. 17 Reference ID: 2a-004-20190220 18 [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/536731/Household_Projections_Published_Tables.xlsx) _ data/file/536731/Household _ Projections _ Published _ Tables.xlsx 19 [https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/datasets/ratioofhousepricetoworkplacebasedearningslowerquartileandmedian](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/datasets/ratioofhousepricetoworkplacebasedearningslowerquartileandmedian) 20 2019 Affordability ratio, Table 5c: (published 19 March 2020) [www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/datasets/ratioofhousepricetoworkplacebasedearningslowerquartileandmedian](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/datasets/ratioofhousepricetoworkplacebasedearningslowerquartileandmedian) 21 Hart Local Plan: www.hart.gov.uk/planning - and - building - [control/planning](https://www.hart.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy/plans-and-policies) - policy/plans - and - policies 47 6.5 The RBWM Local Plan (2013-2033) (adopted 2022) meets the full housing needs of RBWM, and uses a housing target of 712 dwellings per annum for the plan period which equates to an overall target of 14,420 net new dwellings over the plan period [(22)] . 6.6 Wokingham Borough Council is currently updating its Local Plan to 2038. Consultation on a Revised Growth Strategy took place in 2021/2022, which included a housing need of 768 dwellings per annum, equating to 15,513 new dwellings over the plan period. Progress on Wokingham’s Local Plan is on-going. Map 5 Neighbouring local authorities, West Berkshire Housing Market Area and East Berkshire Housing Market Area 22 RBWM adopted Plan: [consult.rbwm.gov.uk/file/5967538](https://consult.rbwm.gov.uk/file/5967538) 48 6.7 Although the NPPF no longer refers to ‘Housing Market Areas’ (HMAs), the PPG provides a definition of a housing market area which refers to the importance of key functional linkages between places where people live and work. The Berkshire (including South Bucks) Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA, February 2016) included work on functional relationships. This found that Bracknell Forest had a strong functional relationship with Wokingham Borough, Reading Borough and West Berkshire. As a result, there has been much collaborative working between these Authorities on housing matters and associated infrastructure. There is an unmet need within Reading Borough’s adopted local plan (covering the period 2021 to 2036) of 230 dwellings, which is projected to arise in the second half of the plan period. As agreed by Western Berkshire HMA Authorities [(23)], this unmet need will be accommodated in the HMA area. 6.8 A housing need of 614 dwellings per annum (dpa) is a significant uplift over the provision made in the previous adopted Local Plan (557 dwellings per annum) and accords with the Government’s objective of significantly boosting housing supply. 6.9 The LHN applies from 2020 and therefore the base date of the Plan is 1 st April 2020. Furthermore, national policy requires strategic policies to cover a minimum of 15 years from the date of adoption. The housing need must be calculated for the period 2020/21 to 2036/37 (17 years). This results in a local need for a minimum of 10,438 (net) additional homes over the plan period, equating to 614 dpa. 6.10 Taking account of existing commitments, the Plan therefore identifies further sites (including a windfall allowance) to meet the minimum requirement for 10,438 homes (614 per annum), as set out in Policy LP 4 'Provision of housing'. |Table 4 Calculating the housing provision for the plan|period| ||| |Local housing need (dwellings per annum)|614| |Plan period (no. of years)|17| |Local housing need over plan period|10,438| 23 Reading’s housing needs: Memorandum of Understanding between the Authorities in the Western Berkshire Housing Market Area, August 2021 49 Meeting the housing requirement Existing planning commitments including retained SALP allocations 6.11 Since the requirement applies from 1 st April 2020, it is necessary to take account of outstanding commitments for development. This includes: Sites with a valid planning permission. Sites which have no formal planning permission but which have been identified in principle as being suitable for development. This is divided into two further categories: sites with a resolution to grant permission subject to a section 106 legal agreement and sites in an adopted Local Plan (i.e. those accepted in principle, but that do not yet have a formal planning permission). 6.12 A number of the commitments involve sites allocated through the SALP - Policies SA3-SA9. Whilst some of these sites have already been completed, others are currently under construction, have outstanding planning permission or are subject to negotiations. These allocations are retained and therefore the relevant policy criteria still apply including to sites that are under construction to cover events such as revised schemes being submitted or a planning permission lapsing. 6.13 As the plan period runs from 2020/21 to 2036/37 it overlaps with the previous plan period (2006/07 – 2025/26). Account is therefore taken of sites already being brought forward as they are likely to contribute a significant number of dwellings during the first half of this plan period. 50 Windfall sites 6.14 These include small and medium sites that have not yet been identified (windfalls) but that will come forward through the development management process in accordance with the policies set out in the Local Plan and through the use of permitted development rights. 6.15 The Council has assessed the contribution likely to be made by ‘windfall’ sites based on past trends (over a 10 year period) and likely changes to those trends. It is clear that windfall sites have consistently played an important role in the housing supply of the Borough. An allowance of 24 dwellings (net) per year has been included for small sites as the SHELAA does not include sites of less than 5 dwellings (net). Although some medium sites are being allocated, historic data suggests that it is justified to include an allowance for medium site windfalls.Whilst an allowance of 77 dwellings (net) per year has been included for the period 2025/26 to 2036/37; to avoid double counting, no allowance has been included for the first 2 years of projected completions and 50% of the allowance has been taken for the third year of the projections. This approach acknowledges the time required to deliver housing on medium sites following the grant of permission. 6.16 Whilst no allowance has been made for large windfall sites, if delivered, they will be reported through the monitoring process.

This was updated during the plan preparation process following formal ‘Calls for Sites’ and consultation exercises. The SHELAA follows government guidance on potentially suitable sites and covers all sites with a capacity for 5 net dwellings or more. Most of the sites that were submitted were promoted for housing. Site selection process 6.19 The Council’s overall approach to identifying land for allocation is set out in the Spatial Strategy. The process followed was set out in a ‘Site Selection Methodology' document [(24)] . Various technical assessments of individual sites were carried out to help identify the most suitable locations for development and the approximate capacity of sites. The SA [(25)] helped inform the iterative site selection process by assessing the sites against the environmental, social and economic objectives. All results were brought together in a Housing Background Paper [(26)] . Housing Trajectory 6.20 The NPPF requires local planning authorities to illustrate the expected rate of housing delivery over the plan period through a ‘Housing Trajectory’. In preparing the Local Plan’s Housing Trajectory the Council engaged with landowners, developers and stakeholders and gave detailed consideration to likely start dates, build-out rates on different types of sites and the lead-in times required for supporting infrastructure. The Housing Trajectory [(27)] shows the timeline for the delivery of housing development [(28)] across the plan period in relation to the annual average requirement. It is however a snapshot in time and is updated annually as part of the annual monitoring exercise. 6.21 The following sources of supply are included: Sites with planning permission Sites accepted in principle subject to a section 106 Agreement Retained SALP allocations Sites allocated for development in this Local Plan A small and medium site windfall allowance. 6.22 Where the timescale for the delivery of a development is projected to extend beyond the plan period, this is noted in the Housing Trajectory: Appendix 1: 'Housing Trajectory and Five Year Housing Land Supply'. 24 http://consult.bracknell - [forest.gov.uk/file/4653109](http://consult.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/file/4653109) 25 https://www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/planning - and - building - [control/planning/planning](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy/development-plan/draft-bracknell-forest-local-plan/evidence-base) - policy/development - plan/draft - bracknell - forest - local - plan/evidence - base 26 https://www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/planning - and - building - [control/planning/planning](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy/development-plan/draft-bracknell-forest-local-plan/evidence-base) - policy/development - plan/draft - bracknell - forest - local - plan/evidence - base 27 Appendix 1: 'Housing Trajectory and Five Year Housing Land Supply' 28 Use Classes C2 and C3 53 Five-year housing supply 6.23 The NPPF refers to the need for a five year supply of deliverable housing sites against the housing requirement. The PPG states that robust evidence is needed to ensure that the five year housing land supply is sound and that the Plan must identify a 5 year housing land supply from its date of adoption. 6.24 Taking account of Policy LP 4 'Provision of housing' for Bracknell Forest, this means that at 1st April 2023, there is a need to identify sites which provide 614 homes per year plus an appropriate buffer, dependent on a range of circumstances set out in the NPPF [(29)] . On adoption of this Plan, Bracknell Forest is able to identify a five year housing land supply (see Appendix 1: 'Housing Trajectory and Five Year Housing Land Supply'). The Appendix includes the calculation of the 5 year housing land supply. 6.25 The ability to demonstrate a five year land supply plus appropriate buffer is important in the decision making process. If the supply falls below the required amount, the presumption in favour of sustainable development applies [(30)], which means that alternative unplanned sites, including those in the countryside (including the Green Belt) may be permitted. The Council is keen to follow a plan-led approach in accordance with the NPPF to prevent this happening. This is why further land has been allocated through the local plan to ensure that a five-year supply can be demonstrated. KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (paragraphs 60-77) PPG (Housing and Economic Needs Assessment; Plan Making: Reference ID: 61-018-20190315) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. 29 para. 74 of NPPF 30 para 11 of NPPF 54 6.2 Sites allocated for residential/mixed use development 6.26 This section deals with the allocation of sites for housing which include allocations on previously-developed and greenfield land and a range of sizes of sites. There is an emphasis on previously developed sites in and around Bracknell Town Centre which is the most sustainable area of the Borough. 6.27 The NPPF requires substantial weight to be given to the use of suitable brownfield land, especially where there are opportunities to remediate contaminated land and support the development of under utilised land and buildings. 55 Policy LP 5 Sites allocated for residential/mixed use development The following sites, as shown on the Policies Map, are allocated and should be developed in accordance with the relevant policies within this Plan and site-specific requirements.

As no reliance is being placed on any additional sites over and above those allocated, total relied upon by Designated Neighbourhood Area is zero. 6.28 The estimated capacity of the sites listed in Policy LP 5 'Sites allocated for residential/mixed use development' is 2,380 new homes. However, this figure includes homes on Land at The Peel Centre and The Point that are likely to be delivered beyond the end of the plan period due to the complexity of the development. 6.29 It is estimated that 2,080 of the new homes on sites listed in Policy LP 5 'Sites allocated for residential/mixed use development' are likely to be delivered in the plan period. This is reflected in the Housing Trajectory and means that the overall supply will exceed the requirement by 752 new homes. 6.30 Policy LP 5 'Sites allocated for residential/mixed use development' lists the sites that are being allocated according to size of site and then parish. The indicative quantum of development for each site is based on an initial assessment of its potential capacity and is neither a maximum nor a minimum. There will be a need to take into account further detailed evidence on constraints, design considerations and the need to ensure the most efficient use of land, at the planning application stage. The inclusion of a site as an allocation does not remove the need for planning permission. 57 6.31 The Local Plan's approach to density is not to be overly prescriptive, but to let the purpose of the development, the context of the site and the defining characteristics of the surrounding area guide the appropriate density. In calculating the quantum of development, average densities have been applied depending on site typology and densities achieved on similar schemes that have recently been completed or that have planning permission. The highest densities have been used to calculate the capacities of sites in and around accessible locations such as Bracknell Town Centre and other transport hubs and the lowest for smaller edge of settlement sites on the fringe of built-up areas. The larger sites may offer scope to achieve higher densities than assumed where there is the ability to design a range of environments with varying characteristics. 6.32 A significant number of the dwellings allocated in this plan form part of mixed-use schemes on sites in and around Bracknell Town Centre (Policy LP 20 'Sites allocated for employment development/mixed use '). These proposals will support the continued regeneration of the area, building on improvements made through the completion of The Lexicon and its supporting infrastructure.The Council has reconfirmed its commitment to extend the regeneration of Bracknell Town Centre through publishing the Bracknell Town Centre Vision 2032 [(31)] . 6.33 This identifies key sites in and around Bracknell Town Centre and discusses their potential and how their redevelopment can be achieved. Due to the considerable collective capacity of these sites and the need to ensure that development supports and complements existing and committed development, masterplans will need to be produced to establish an overall vision and strategy for development that demonstrate a high quality, comprehensive approach to design. Masterplans will be submitted in a timely manner to be agreed with the Council for Eastern Gateway Development Area (Town Square) (BRA7), and the Southern Gateway Development Area (including Jubilee Gardens (BRA14), the Bus Station (BRA17) and Land east of Station Way and north of Church Road (BRA15)). Once agreed, the masterplans will be important material planning considerations in the determination of planning applications. They will provide a framework aimed at encouraging and coordinating the efforts and investment of partners in the further revitalisation of the area and provide further details on placemaking, connectivity, relationship of uses, access and servicing, parking, provision of greenspace and phasing. 6.34 Specific policies are included for five strategic sites listed in Policy LP 5 'Sites allocated for residential/mixed use development' (Beaufort Park, Derby Field, The Peel Centre/The Point, Eastern Gateway and Southern Gateway), which have complex constraints and requirements. Development proposals should enable comprehensive schemes to be delivered on these allocations to create sustainable developments that support and complement the role of nearby settlements and communities. These sites are supported by illustrative concept plans showing the possible arrangement of uses. 6.35 Site specific policies are also included for other sites listed in Policy LP 5 'Sites allocated for residential/mixed use development'. Maps are included showing developable areas, as these do not necessarily coincide with site boundaries due to the need to take into account site specific constraints and requirements. For sites involving settlement extensions, the revised settlement boundaries are also shown in order to provide a degree of certainty to developers and the community. (For the avoidance of doubt a site has been allocated as part of the Warfield Neighbourhood Plan which will provide 235 dwellings). Allocated sites are subject to all relevant policies within the Development Plan. Development Briefs may be produced for some sites at a later stage. For summaries of the evidence that has been obtained in relation to each 31 www.bracknell - [forest.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2021](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2021-09/bracknell-town-centre-2032-vision.pdf) - 09/bracknell - town - centre - 2032 - vision.pdf 58 site (including the SA), and how this evidence has informed each site’s Site Suitability Assessment, Developable Area Assessment and Site Specific Requirements see the Housing Background Paper [(32)] . 6.36 The majority of new homes brought forward on sites through the SALP are on sites of more than 500 dwellings. Due to long lead-in times caused by the amount of infrastructure required and site preparation works, many of these will be delivering housing over much of this plan period. In recognition of this, the Council has included some smaller sites which support the Government’s aim of diversifying the market and supporting medium and small housebuilders. 6.37 Small sites will also help meet any short-term housing requirements. Windfall sites will also add to the supply and will expand the market to other housebuilders. 6.38 Para. 66 of the NPPF states that strategic policies should identify a housing requirement for designated neighbourhood areas within the overall requirement. This should reflect the overall strategy for the pattern and scale of development and any relevant allocations. As no reliance is being placed upon any sites being allocated within neighbourhood plans across the Borough, there is no reason or need to set out a housing requirement figure for any of the Designated Neighbourhood Areas. This is reflected in Table 9 of Policy LP 5 'Sites allocated for residential/mixed use development'. If any sites are allocated through the neighbourhood plan process, these will be treated as additional to the homes being planned in this document. This applies to Land at Hayley Green which has been allocated for 235 dwellings through the Warfield Neighbourhood Plan [(33)], which forms part of the Housing Trajectory (contained in Appendix 1: 'Housing Trajectory and Five Year Housing Land Supply'), and is consistent with the strategic policies of this Plan. KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (paragraphs 20, 66 and 68) Strategic Housing and Economic Land Availability Assessment (SHELAA) BFLP evidence base.

It now forms part of the Development Plan for Bracknell Forest. The Hayley Green allocation is set out in Policy WNP2. 59 6.3 Land at Beaufort Park, Nine Mile Ride, Bracknell 6.39 The site comprises a parcel of land in single ownership that is predominantly coniferous and broadleaved woodland including woodland plantations and areas of grassland and heathland. 6.40 The southern boundary of the site adjoins Nine Mile Ride which is an important east-west pedestrian, cycle and vehicular route in the Borough. The southern part of the site is an established green strategic landscape buffer which provides a woodland setting to Nine Mile Ride. The western boundary of the site adjoins woodland and sporadic development. The former Transport Research Laboratory ('Buckler's Park') site lies to the south, much of which is currently being developed as an extension to the settlement of Crowthorne. To the east of the site is Great Hollands Recreation ground and the settlement of Bracknell. 6.41 This site would form an extension to the settlement of Bracknell. The comprehensive development of the land is essential to maximise the site's potential and deal effectively with the constraints (in particular ground and surface water flood risk, ecology, and proximity to the Thames Basin Heaths SPA) that affect the site. 60 61 62 63 Housing 6.42 The site is allocated for approximately 230 dwellings, of which 35% are to be affordable. An element of specialist accommodation for older people is to be included within the 230 dwellings, to contribute to the specific housing needs of the Borough. 6.43 In order to provide plots suitable for those on the Council’s Self Build Register, serviced plots equivalent to 5% of the total homes provided, shall be provided on the site and offered for sale to self or custom builders. If the plots are not taken up for self-build after a reasonable period of marketing, they may be developed for alternative housing. The details of the arrangements for this will be included in a section 106 legal agreement. 6.44 It is also expected that the development will incorporate a mix of dwelling types. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 16 'Affordable housing' and Policy LP 40 'Housing mix'. Site layout Proposals for the site should be design-led. There should be a coordinated and integrated approach to green infrastructure from the outset. Consideration should also be given as to how the site can link with adjoining sites and also to other matters set out in the Policy. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 28 'Design principles'. Green infrastructure 6.45 A holistic approach is required to protect, enhance and provide new green infrastructure (in line with Policy LP 30 'Green infrastructure'). Considerations for the masterplan include: the layout of OSPV and SANG within the site; provision of SuDS; how biodiversity connectivity will be achieved, including a green corridor network with access routes within and adjoining the site; protection and enhancement of trees, including restoration within the strategic landscape buffer; and landscaping of the site. Mitigation for habitats sites 6.46 Mitigation will be required to avoid and mitigate the impact of residential development on the habitats sites in agreement with the Council and Natural England. This will include provision in perpetuity of on-site bespoke SANG at a minimum of 8ha per 1,000 new population which is linked to Buckler’s Park SANG; a financial contribution towards Strategic Access Management and Monitoring; and any other measures that are required to satisfy Habitats Regulations, the Council's Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area Strategy and relevant guidance. A bespoke SANG must be in place and available for use by the occupants of the new development before the first new dwelling is occupied. The final layout and location of the SANG will be influenced, amongst other matters, by a project level Habitats Regulations Assessment. 64 6.47 There are a number of potential options for SANG location/provision depending on circumstances. These are: SANG land in the northern part of the site which is large enough to provide SANG capacity for the allocated development which is linked to existing SANGs by green routes forming part of a wider SANG network (Super SANG). SANG land in the southern part of the site which is large enough to provide SANG capacity for the allocated development which is linked to existing SANGs by green routes forming part of a wider SANG network (Super SANG) SANG land in the southern and northern part of the site which is large enough to provide SANG capacity for the allocated development and other developments which are located within its catchment area. This SANG land is also required to link to existing SANGs by green routes forming part of a wider SANG network (Super SANG). A standalone SANG in the southern and northern part of the site which is large enough to provide a circular walk of at least 2.3km. This standalone SANG will not be required to be linked to nearby SANGs but can provide SANG capacity for the allocated development and for other developments which are located within its catchment area. 6.48 This Policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 32 'Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area', and Policy LP 31 'Designated nature conservation and geological sites'. Strategic landscape buffer, setting of settlements and open space 6.49 The part of the site allocated for housing will form an extension to the settlement of Bracknell. The remainder of the allocation (comprising open space and SANG) is located outside the defined settlement, which also forms part of the open space between Bracknell, Crowthorne and Wokingham, and enhances the setting of the settlements. 6.50 The Landscape Character Assessment (LUC, 2015) states that one of the valued attributes of the landscape character within the site is the wooded area between Crowthorne and Bracknell. Therefore, it is essential to retain a strategic landscape buffer along the southern part of the site, to preserve the visual and physical separation between Crowthorne and Bracknell, the identity of the settlements, and also retain the wooded character of Nine Mile Ride. This should be reinforced with additional tree planting. 6.51 Subject to maintaining the character of Nine Mile Ride, and the setting of the settlements of Crowthorne and Bracknell, the landscape buffer may be able to incorporate recreational leisure paths. A single vehicular and pedestrian/cycle link between the developed area of the site and Nine Mile Ride (the primary access route) will pass through the landscape buffer. This route will need careful design to preserve the character and function of the landscape buffer. There may also be an opportunity to enhance the buffer's function as a green corridor. 6.52 The on-site OSPV and SANG also plays an important role in protecting the setting of the settlements by keeping the area open and undeveloped. A site-wide masterplan and landscape strategy, should demonstrate how the Landscape Character Assessment (LUC, 2015) has been taken into consideration, including how identified landscape features and functions relating to the site will not be compromised. This should include consideration of appropriate boundary features within the site, and how the distinctive character of the settlements 65 will be protected and enhanced. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 36 'Landscape character (outside of defined settlements) ', Policy LP 30 'Green infrastructure', and Policy LP 54 'Protection and enhancement of trees and hedgerows'. Pipeline 6.53 A pipeline is located in the southern part of the site. This includes an easement which should be kept clear of development. Access to the pipe area should be retained, in order that any future maintenance can take place. [(34)] Transport 6.54 The proposal will result in additional traffic movements to and from the site. Transport modelling work developed as part of the Local Plan has identified that capacity improvements to nearby road junctions (Bracknell Road/Foresters Way, Easthampstead Road/Old Wokingham Road and Crowthorne High Street) will be required. 6.55 The primary vehicular access point into the site will be via a fourth arm off the TRL roundabout. The design of the access route onto Nine Mile Ride, should be sensitive to the role of this part of the site as a strategic landscape buffer. South Road will act as a secondary minor access. Measures should be incorporated to reduce the attractiveness of South Road as a primary point of access. A Transport Assessment will be required to demonstrate impact of the proposal, and any mitigation measures. 6.56 Improvements to footways along Old Wokingham Road and Nine Mile Ride will be required, to allow shared use, and should also link to the wider cycle track/footpath network, to the north and east into the Bracknell Town urban area and south towards Crowthorne and the recent TRL development (Buckler’s Park). Leisure routes may also be required to link the on-site SANG to other SANG in the vicinity of the site. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 25 'Transport principles'. Other infrastructure requirements 6.57 On and off-site infrastructure, in accordance with the Infrastructure Delivery Plan, will be required to support the development. Infrastructure required to support the development may be secured through in-kind provision and/or through developer contributions. On-site waste recycling facilities will also need to be provided. This policy should also be read in conjunction with Policy LP 24 'Infrastructure'. Flooding and SuDS 6.58 Part of the site is at risk of surface water flooding, with high ground water levels occurring across a large proportion of the site. Some areas at risk of surface water flooding also coincide with areas of high ground water levels. The extent and location of these areas have informed the identified developable area and the settlement boundary. Development of the site should avoid areas at risk of flooding and high groundwater levels, and provide suitable sustainable drainage systems to mitigate the impact of the development (that is shallow surface level SuDS as opposed to buried traditional systems). Off-site drainage improvements may be required. The extensive loss of trees across the developed area is likely to result in an increase in 34 ‘Linesearch’ ( [www.lsbud.co.uk](https://www.lsbud.co.uk) ) must be undertaken in relation to the pipeline. All development in proximity to the CLH-PS pipeline must have the consent of CLH-PS and be in accordance with the Pipeline Safety Regulations 1996, Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. 66 baseflows from the site. It is imperative that the loss of large areas of woodland are taken into consideration when considering the undeveloped hydrological and hydrogeological situation to ensure mitigation is fully provided. 6.59 When developing a site wide masterplan, technical investigation and assessment of all sources of flooding should be undertaken to determine the flood risk management measures, and SuDS features required (including OSPV and SANG areas), in order to achieve sustainable development. This should meet the requirements for the site identified in the Level 2 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (JBA, 2019). This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 33 'Flood risk' and Policy LP 57 'Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)'. Biodiversity 6.60 The site is predominantly coniferous and broadleaved woodland with woodland plantations covering the southern half of the site. It also contains areas of acid grassland, acid heath, deciduous woodland and coniferous parkland/scattered trees. There is potential at this site for ground-nesting birds to be present (the same as those found within the wider Thames Basin Heaths SPA). Therefore, a detailed ecological impact assessment will be required to identify and assess potential impacts on the habitats and species present at the site. Overall, the site layout will need to be designed sensitively to balance existing biodiversity with the needs of the development. A site management plan for at least 30 years after development has been completed is also required to set out the programme of works needed to achieve restoration and enhancements to the site. 6.61 The heathland and acid grassland in the northern part of the site are UK priority habitats, and this has informed the extent of the developable area and settlement boundary. Existing heathland, grassland and trees also provide important habitat connections from east to west, and form part of the wider Green Infrastructure network. There is an opportunity to improve the quality of these habitats, in order to ensure a BNG of at least 10% is provided to mitigate the development. The Council will also consider the use of a conservation covenant to secure the long-term future of these habitats. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 53 'Biodiversity'. Trees 6.62 An area of plantation woodland will need to be removed in order to accommodate development on the site. A tree survey and arboricultural impact assessment, in accordance with British Standard 5837 ‘Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction’ (as may be amended or substituted) will be required. Any trees of notable interest (such as ancient or veteran) should be incorporated into the design of the proposal. 6.63 Development of the site should not compromise the long-term health of retained trees, which will need to be appropriately safeguarded during construction in accordance with British Standard 5837 ‘Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction’, as may be amended or substituted. Careful consideration will also need to be given to the drainage of the site, and placement of utilities. 6.64 New tree planting (which may be individual or groups of trees to provide naturalistic features) as part of the landscaping of the site will be required, including at gateway locations such as the primary access into the site, and focal areas within the site. 67 6.65 The strategic landscape buffer to Nine Mile Ride will need to be enhanced and restored with additional tree planting, in order to safeguard the woodland setting and character of the area. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 54 'Protection and enhancement of trees and hedgerows'. Other matters As the Development Plan should be read as a whole, regard will need to be had to all relevant adopted planning policies (including any in the Bracknell Town Neighbourhood Plan, and the Joint Minerals and Waste Plan), together with Supplementary Planning Guidance, in the consideration of this site. It is recommended that a pre-application proposal is submitted for consideration prior to the submission of a planning application. KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (Chapter 5 delivering a sufficient supply of homes; Chapter 8 Promoting healthy and safe communities; Chapter 12 Achieving well-designed places). PPG (Housing needs of different groups; Design: process and tools). Housing Background Paper (BFC) (This provides an overview of the relevant evidence base for the site). DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. Whilst the majority of the area to be developed is greenfield, extensive investigations and preparatory works will be required due to flooding and biodiversity issues. Provided that an acceptable scheme can be negotiated, including suitable mitigation and SANG can be provided in a timely manner, it is envisaged that housing could start to be delivered in 2028/29. Depending on market conditions and other factors, it is estimated that the development will take 4 years to complete (see Appendix 1: 'Housing Trajectory and Five Year Housing Land Supply'). 68 6.4 Land east of Wokingham Road and south of Dukes Ride (Derby Field), Crowthorne 6.66 The site comprises a parcel of land in single ownership that is currently used as private school playing fields providing cricket and rugby pitches. There is a pavilion building in the north east corner. The site boundaries consist of hedging and trees. To the east and north is a mix of residential and commercial uses and to the west and south is sporadic residential development amidst woodland. The Reading to Redhill/ Gatwick Airport railway line runs along the eastern boundary. The site borders Wokingham Borough and is in close proximity to Crowthorne Rail Station which has a small car park. The site would form an extension to the settlement of Crowthorne. 69 70 71 Figure 2 Derby Field Illustrative Concept Plan 72 Housing 6.67 The site is allocated for approximately 220 dwellings of which 35% are affordable. An element of specialist accommodation for older people is to be included within the 220 dwellings, to contribute to the specific housing needs of the Borough. 6.68 In order to provide plots suitable for those on the Council’s Self Build Register, serviced plots equivalent to 5% of the total homes provided, shall be provided on the site and offered for sale to self or custom builders. If the plots are not taken up for self-build after a reasonable period of marketing, they may be developed for alternative housing. The details of the arrangements for this will be included in a section 106 legal agreement. 6.69 It is expected that the development will incorporate a mix of dwelling types. This Policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 16 'Affordable housing' and Policy LP 40 'Housing mix'. Site layout 6.70 Proposals for the site should be design-led. There should be a coordinated and integrated approach to green infrastructure from the outset. Consideration should also be given as to how the site can link with the adjoining area and also to other matters set out in this Policy. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 28 'Design principles'. Green infrastructure 6.71 In developing a site wide masterplan, a holistic approach is required to protect, enhance and provide new green infrastructure (in line with Policy LP 30 'Green infrastructure'). Considerations for the masterplan include: the layout of OSPV and access to nearby SANG; provision of SuDS; how biodiversity connectivity will be achieved including a green corridor/leisure route, as part of a network/ grid with access routes within and adjoining the site; protection and enhancement of trees, including along the boundary with Wokingham Road; and landscaping of the site. Open space 6.72 The site should include provision of active OSPV on-site. It may be necessary to provide financial contributions towards off-site provision where development cannot provide the full amount on-site. OSPV will also play an important role in protecting and enhancing the physical and visual setting of Crowthorne by keeping this part of the site area open and undeveloped for housing. 73 Replacement playing pitches 6.73 Development of the site will result in the loss of playing pitches. The NPPF states that existing open spaces should not be built on unless the loss resulting from the proposed development would be replaced by equivalent or better provision in a suitable location (paragraph 99). It is proposed to replace the pitches elsewhere in the Wellington College estate and deliver qualitative improvements to provision. The existing playing pitches are currently in private use for the school. The new pitches will be available for Wellington College and also secured for community use thereby increasing local provision of sports facilities in the area. Station car parking 6.74 Crowthorne station is located on a popular commuter route, but the station car park does not have enough capacity, resulting in parking issues in the surrounding area. To ensure that this does not adversely affect new residents, additional car parking for the station will be required. It is proposed that some of the site is utilised and the existing car park ‘squared off’ to increase the capacity from 42 (including 2 disabled) to approximately 87 spaces (including 10 disabled); an increase of approximately 45 car parking spaces. This is shown on the Illustrative Concept Plan. Mitigation for habitats sites 6.75 Mitigation will be required to avoid and mitigate the impact of residential development upon the habitats sites in agreement with the Council and Natural England. The development should provide SANG capacity to serve it. This should be on the wooded area of land known as Silverdene. A connection to this land should be made from the south of the site. Should further SANG capacity be required a financial contribution should be made to purchase Council owned strategic SANG for the balance of SANG capacity required. A financial contribution towards SAMM should also be secured. The development will require a Habitats Regulations Assessment at the application stage which must meet the requirements of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 (as amended). This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 32 'Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area' and Policy LP 31 'Designated nature conservation and geological sites'. Setting of settlements and lands cap e buffer 6.76 The part of the site for housing will form an extension to the settlement of Crowthorne. The remainder of the allocation (comprising a landscape buffer, OSPV and the boundary along Wokingham Road) is located outside of the defined settlement. Development of the site should maintain a gap within the site between Crowthorne and the linear development to the south of the site by providing a landscape buffer, which includes open space within the southern end of the site and supplementary tree planting along the boundary with Wokingham Road. This should also include measures to achieve a strong physical and visual separation with the defined settlement boundary, appropriate boundary features within the site, and protection and enhancement of the setting of the settlement of Crowthorne. 6.77 The Landscape Character Assessment (LUC, 2015) sets out that one of the valued attributes of the area is the intricate mosaic of heathland, woodland and grasslands which provide a sense of naturalness, visual diversity and a setting for recreation and enjoyment of the landscape. Subject to consideration of the setting of the settlement of Crowthorne, the landscape buffer could therefore enhance these attributes and incorporate recreational leisure 74 paths and OSPV. There may also be an opportunity to enhance the functionality of green corridors. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 36 'Landscape character (outside of defined settlements) ' and Policy LP 30 'Green infrastructure'. Transport 6.78 The proposal will result in additional traffic movements to and from the site. Transport modelling has identified the need for capacity improvements to junctions including Crowthorne High Street, improving walking and cycling connections to Crowthorne Rail Station and improved cycle parking and waiting facilities. 6.79 Necessary additional highway improvements may include, but are not limited to: Improvements to the footways along Dukes Ride to allow shared use providing better accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists to Crowthorne High Street; Upgrading of the existing Public Footpath linking Cheviot Road to Dukes Ride; Improving walking and cycling links to educational facilities including Edgbarrow School and possibly the proposed primary school on the TRL site (Buckler's Park); Improvements to public transport links to Bracknell Town Centre and links to the wider area, including the TRL development (Buckler's Park) and Crowthorne Rail Station. Other infrastructure requirements 6.80 On and off-site infrastructure, in accordance with the Infrastructure Delivery Plan, will be required to support the development. Infrastructure required to support the development may be secured including in-kind provision and/or through developer contributions. Connectivity to, from and across the site should be provided for pedestrians and for leisure activities.These should include adopted routes for example to access the shops and rail station and unlit leisure routes to access the Public Rights of Way (PRoW) network, open space and SANG. 6.81 On-site waste recycling facilities will need to be provided. This Policy should also be read in conjunction with Policy LP 24 'Infrastructure'. Sustainable drainage systems 6.82 Part of the site is at risk of surface water flooding which is a material consideration and needs to inform the layout of the site from the outset. Development of the site should avoid these areas and provide suitable open SuDS, rather than buried traditional systems. Opportunities to integrate these with wider green infrastructure improvements should be established in the masterplan. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 57 'Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)'. Biodiversity 6.83 The development of both Derby Field playing fields (and the replacement pitches) will need to achieve at least 10% BNG. This will require habitat restoration and creation on land within the Wellington College estate to create heathland and broadleaf woodland. The Council will secure by section 106 agreement management and monitoring for at least 30 years after the development has been completed, and will consider of the use of a conservation covenant to ensure protection of the area in perpetuity. 75 6.84 The trees and hedgerows around the perimeter of the site and other identified habitats of value on the site should be retained and the existing ecological network improved. 6.85 The development should also include green corridors through the development parcels forming a green grid to connect natural features and provide access to the on-site OSPV. Within the development parcels, feature trees, hedgerows and tiny forests should be planted. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 53 'Biodiversity', Policy LP 31 'Designated nature conservation and geological sites' and Policy LP 30 'Green infrastructure'. Trees 6.86 There are a number of trees around the perimeter of the site, particularly along Wokingham Road and the boundary of the railway line which should be retained and supplemented with appropriate additional planting to enhance the landscape and screening of the development. A tree survey and arboricultural impact assessment, in accordance with British Standard 5837 ‘Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction’ (as may be amended or substituted) will be required. 6.87 Development of the site should not compromise the long-term health of the trees, which will need to be appropriately safeguarded during construction in accordance with British Standard 5837 ‘Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction’, as may be amended or substituted. Careful consideration will also need to be given to the drainage of the site, and placement of utilities. 6.88 New appropriate tree planting (which may be individual or groups of trees to provide naturalistic features) as part of the landscaping of the site will be required, including at gateway locations such as the primary access into the site, and focal areas within the site. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 54 'Protection and enhancement of trees and hedgerows'. Heritage 6.89 Crowthorne Station, a locally listed building, is located to the north east of the site on the opposite side of the railway line. Some modern improvements have been made to the station, between the site and the station building.The significance of this heritage asset needs to be protected from harm and opportunities will be sought to conserve and enhance its significance in line with Policy LP 29 'Conservation and enhancement of the historic environment'. Development proposals should be accompanied by a Heritage Statement demonstrating a clear understanding of the significance of the setting of the station building and how its significance would be conserved and enhanced. Additional mitigation 6.90 The current proposed location of the replacement pitches elsewhere on the Wellington College estate requires additional mitigation. This should include enhancements that result in net biodiversity gain of at least 10% (for both Derby Field and the replacement pitches – see Biodiversity above), SuDS and consideration of landscape impacts, including the loss of trees. 6.91 The layout of the replacement pitches will need to consolidate sports provision as much as possible to ensure that any gaps between pitch areas and other associated uses are minimised, to avoid creating small islands of habitat that are isolated and vulnerable to intensive landscape management. 76 6.92 Locally relevant and historic drains should be treated as a constraint; these will need to be retained in the same or similar locations where possible and the layout of the pitches designed around them to an extent that permits practical layout and high standard of pitches. Additional ditches can be used where it is not possible to retain existing ditches. Additional technical investigation and assessment will be necessary to ensure proposals accord with the Land Drainage Act and the Council’s Local Flood Risk Management Strategy (or any subsequent update). Any loss of plantation coniferous woodland for the replacement pitches is likely to result in an increase in baseflows from the site. It is imperative that any such loss of trees is taken into consideration when considering the undeveloped hydrological and hydrogeological situation to ensure mitigation is fully provided. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 33 'Flood risk' and Policy LP 57 'Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)'. Other matters 6.93 As the Development Plan should be read as a whole, regard will need to be had to all relevant adopted planning policies (including any Neighbourhood Plans, and the Joint Minerals and Waste Plan), together with Supplementary Planning Guidance, in the consideration of this site. It is recommended that a pre-application proposal is submitted for consideration prior to the submission of a planning application. KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (Chapter 5 Delivering a sufficient supply of homes; Chapter 8 Promoting healthy and safe communities; Chapter 12 Achieving well-designed places) PPG (Housing needs of different groups; Housing for older and disabled people; Design: process and tools) Housing Background Paper (BFC) (This provides an overview of the relevant evidence base for the site) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications: The site is currently a playing field. Although it is not currently publicly accessible it will be necessary to provide alternative playing pitches, to replace those currently provided on site, prior to development. Provided that an acceptable scheme can be negotiated, including suitable mitigation and SANG can be provided in a timely manner, it is envisaged that housing could start to be delivered in 2027/2028. Depending on market conditions and other factors, it is estimated that the development will take 4 years to complete (see Appendix 1: 'Housing Trajectory and Five Year Housing Land Supply'). 77 6.5 The Peel Centre and The Point, Skimped Hill Lane, Bracknell 6.94 The Peel Centre and The Point are located on the edge of Bracknell Town Centre. The site is in a sustainable location with good access to Bracknell Town Centre to the east, and public transport hubs. It currently provides medium-scale warehouse style retail units, a supermarket and ‘The Point’ which includes a bowling alley, cinema, bingo, restaurants and beauty salon, as well as a surface level car park serving the retail and leisure facilities.The site has two key pedestrian links: east to Market Street (which in turn leads to the bus and rail station to the south); and a north/south link towards Arlington Square (north), the Southern Employment Area and Wildridings residential neighbourhood (south) via footways/cycleways that run past this site. 6.95 The site area is approximately 6.54ha occupying a broadly triangular piece of land which tapers to the north eastern corner.The site is bounded to the north west by the dual carriageway of Skimped Hill Lane. There are two vehicular access points off this road into the site. There is a well-used footway/cycleway on the north western edge of the site providing access to health facilities and Bracknell Town Centre. There is a large service yard area in the southern part of the site, providing rear access to all the retail warehouse units and the supermarket. The Point has its own service yard off Skimped Hill Lane. The railway line is adjacent to the southern boundary. There are good pedestrian and cycle links to residential and commercial neighbourhoods south of the railway via a network of subways under the Twin Bridges roundabout. Beyond this is Old Bracknell Lane West which has an existing allocation for a mix of residential and commercial uses. To the east are two development sites that have planning approval for residential development off Market Street. The former Bus Depot (Site BRA12) immediately adjacent to the Point also has permission for mixed-use development.To the west of the site is Twin Bridges roundabout, which is part of the highway network linking the M3 and M4 motorways. 78 79 80 81 Housing 6.96 The site is allocated for approximately 900 dwellings, with approximately 600 of these to be delivered during this plan period up to March 2037. This is to include provision of affordable housing (35%) across the site (approximately 210 in the plan period) and specialist accommodation for older people to contribute to the specific housing needs of the Borough, which is to be included within the total to be delivered in the plan period. Employment uses 6.97 The Peel Centre currently includes a supermarket at the south western end of the site. In the short-term, development of other phases of the site will have to take account of the retention of the food store and facilitate its current operation, including an appropriate level of parking for the food store and staff, and service yard access. The Council is seeking to retain a supermarket function on the site and will require the new replacement premises and its associated car parking to be built before the existing is removed. It is envisaged that this could be part of a mixed-use block with convenience retailing on the ground floor of approximately 3,000m 2 . Car parking for a new food store will need to be carefully designed and located within the site so as not to impact on the residential areas and their associated parking. 6.98 The site currently has approximately 15,500m 2 of retail and 8,500m 2 of leisure floorspace. Some of the existing occupiers have also had a presence in Bracknell Town Centre since the Lexicon opened in 2017. With almost all leases on the existing buildings due to expire in the short to medium term, it is not considered that the current format of the retail warehousing or market demand will continue throughout the plan period. To help support the continuing regeneration and ongoing viability of Bracknell Town Centre, the policy seeks approximately 500m 2 gross office and 500m 2 gross floorspace for other commercial development in addition to the food store. This will provide flexibility for the market to deliver floorspace in uses which are in highest demand over the plan period and beyond. Design and phasing 6.99 Based on the latest information available for the site, it is anticipated that the development may come forward in three phases, being redeveloped east to west across the site: Phase 1 – The Point: redeveloped to deliver a mixed-use residential led scheme. Existing supermarket, retail units, service road and associated customer car parking at the Peel Centre to be retained and accessed off Skimped Hill Lane. Phase 2 – The Peel Centre: eastern element – a mixed-use development incorporating: a. replacement supermarket and associated customer car parking; b. commercial and office floorspace; and c. a mix of residential uses to include specialist accommodation for older people. Phase 3 – The Peel Centre: western element – a residential led mixed-use development. Existing supermarket, service road and car parking to be redeveloped. 82 6.100 It is essential that in accordance with Policy LP 28 'Design principles' development of the site is design-led, positively contributing to placemaking from the outset. Constraints and opportunities should inform the layout of the site, ensuring a comprehensive and well-designed development that will successfully integrate into the wider area. 6.101 In addition to being in a sustainable location, redevelopment of The Peel Centre and The Point will make effective and efficient use of PDL (NPPF chapter 11). It is therefore essential that proposals for the site are design-led and informed by a masterplan for the site that has been agreed with the Council. A capacity study for the site has been undertaken, which the masterplan and planning applications will be expected to take into account. 6.102 The site should create a sense of place with its own identity and character.The height, scale and form of the buildings must be carefully considered in order to contribute positively to the streetscenes.There should be a coordinated and integrated approach to green infrastructure from the outset. Consideration should be given to landmark buildings to signal the arrival and approach to the town centre in accordance with an agreed masterplan. The site should deliver a high quality public realm, based on a clear strategy for the site, including structural planting and landscaping to provide a pleasant living environment for all. Inside the site, car parking should not dominate and should be provided within the footprint of the built forms and shared street areas should be designed to be pedestrian friendly. Green infrastructure and open space 6.103 In developing a site wide masterplan, a holistic approach is required to protect, enhance and provide new green infrastructure (in line with Policy LP 30 'Green infrastructure'). Considerations for the masterplan include: the layout of OSPV within the site, including play and amenity areas; provision of SuDS; how biodiversity connectivity will be achieved including a green corridor network with access routes within and adjoining the site; and landscaping of the site. 6.104 OSPV is an important component of achieving a sustainable mixed-use scheme and taking opportunities to achieve net environmental gains. Provision should include a green corridor within the site and fully integrated landscaping, open SuDS and biodiversity features in the public realm. Active and natural play spaces should be provided in the public realm (including for example, a skate bowl, ramps and a children’s play area). Usable communal amenity space for future residents should be incorporated in areas of public realm that run the length of the site. Usable private amenity space should also be provided for residents on the site. In the short term the southern part of the site will be retained as a service yard and its access. In the longer term it will incorporate open SuDS which allow for substantial green space and can be landscaped to provide further play and amenity areas, and opportunities for biodiversity. Additionally, improvements in OSPV in and around Bracknell Town Centre will be sought that future residents will be able to access and enjoy. The layout and landscaping of the site should maximise opportunities for public and private amenity space. 83 Mitigation for habitats sites 6.105 It will not be possible to develop and make effective use of the site if a SANG is provided on site. An off-site solution will need to be found as a requirement of any planning consent which can include the purchase of SANG capacity from third party SANGs capable of serving the development. The development will require a Habitats Regulations Assessment at the application stage which must meet the requirements of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 (as amended). This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 32 'Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area' and Policy LP 31 'Designated nature conservation and geological sites'. Transport 6.106 Development of the site will need to take account of the outcome of a Transport Assessment which should include coverage of the impact of the site on Junction 10 of the M4 and Junctions 3 and 4 of the M3. Highway improvements necessary to support development of the site include: Capacity improvements to nearby road junctions including Western Roundabout and Running Horse Roundabout. Improvements to the footways along Market Street to allow shared use providing better accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists to education and the wider cycle track network. Improving public transport links to the wider area. Other infrastructure requirements 6.107 On- and off-site infrastructure, in accordance with the Infrastructure Delivery Plan, will be required to support the development. Infrastructure required to support the development may be secured through in-kind provision and/or through developer contributions. On-site waste recycling facilities will also need to be provided. This policy should also be read in conjunction with Policy LP 24 'Infrastructure'. 6.108 The site is sustainably located on the edge of Bracknell Town Centre, within approximately a 5-minute walk of rail and bus stations, and Bracknell Town Centre. Accordingly, links connecting the site to the wider network and Town Centre are essential in order to maximise sustainable modes of transport and connectivity. This includes enhanced pedestrian/cycle links and new pedestrian links as shown on the Illustrative Concept Plan. Parking 6.109 Development of the site will require residential car parking to be accommodated in a manner that does not dominate the public realm. A solution may be to locate car parking underground, or within the building at ground level but set back to allow for active frontages along street edges. Private residential courtyards could be raised and located on the roof of car parks, to maximise amenity space and provide further opportunities for on-site biodiversity whilst meeting parking standards. 84 Flooding and SuDS 6.110 Part of the site is at risk of surface water flooding and associated drainage issues. These are material considerations and need to inform the layout of the site from the outset. When developing a site wide masterplan, technical investigation and assessment of all sources of flooding should be undertaken to determine the flood risk management measures and SuDS features required (including OSPV areas) in order to achieve sustainable development. This should meet the requirements for the site identified in the Level 2 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (JBA, 2019). 6.111 High quality public realm and OSPV should incorporate SuDS and buildings will be expected to include measures, such as green roofs, to capture water where it falls and ease drainage issues whilst contributing to enhancing BNG on the site. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 33 'Flood risk' and Policy LP 57 'Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)'. Biodiversity 6.112 The current use of the site does not lend itself to areas of high ecological value. A benefit of redeveloping the site with a strong landscape strategy, including integrated green infrastructure throughout, is that the site can help improve air quality, benefit local health and wellbeing, promote biodiversity, and achieve a BNG. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 53 'Biodiversity' and Policy LP 30 'Green infrastructure'. Pollution and potential for contamination 6.113 The site is located close to the railway line between London Waterloo and Reading, and the highway network which includes a key route between the M3 and M4 motorways. This means that careful consideration needs to be given to noise and other pollution issues that might affect the health and well-being of future residents. Due to the proximity of the site to main roads and a railway, it will be necessary to undertake and take account of an acoustic report, and due to proximity to the AQMA (to the south of the site), undertake and take account of an air quality assessment to assess the impact of the AQMA on the health of future residents. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 58 'Pollution and hazards'. 6.114 Due to the addition of sensitive land uses on the site, it will also be necessary to assess the potential for contamination within the site in accordance with Policy LP 59 'Development of land potentially affected by contamination'. Other matters 6.115 As the Development Plan should be read as a whole, regard will need to be had to all relevant adopted planning policies (including any in the Bracknell Town Neighbourhood Plan and the Joint Minerals and Waste Plan), together with Supplementary Planning Guidance, in the consideration of this site. It is recommended that a pre-application proposal is submitted for consideration prior to the submission of a planning application. 85 KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (Chapter 5 Delivering a sufficient supply of homes; Chapter 8 Promoting healthy and safe communities; Chapter 11 Making effective use of land; Chapter 12 Achieving well-designed places) PPG (Effective use of land; Housing needs of different groups; Housing for older and disabled people; Design: process and tools) Housing Background Paper (BFC) (This provides an overview of the relevant evidence base for the site) Peel Centre, Bracknell Capacity Study (October 2020) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. The site is in single ownership, however existing commercial uses on the site have leases with different agreements in place. Provided that an acceptable scheme can be negotiated, and that suitable mitigation and SANG can be provided in a timely manner, it is envisaged that housing could start to be delivered in 2031/2032. This is due to the site's complexity and phasing of development. Depending on market conditions and other factors, it is estimated that approximately 600 dwellings (including units for older people), the replacement supermarket, 500m 2 of office and 500m 2 of other commercial floorspace will be delivered during the plan period. Further development will take place in the next plan period (Appendix 1: 'Housing Trajectory and Five Year Housing Land Supply'). 86 6.6 Eastern Gateway Development Area (Town Square), Bracknell 6.116 The site comprises land in single ownership (owned by Bracknell Forest Council). It is a previously developed site in a sustainable location, located within the boundary of Bracknell Town Centre. It comprises Bracknell Central library, Easthampstead House (former Council offices, comprising a detached building with adjacent parking area), Town Square (pedestrian/landscaped area), and an area of open space with some trees in the eastern part of the site. 6.117 The northern boundary of the site adjoins Millennium Way. The western boundary adjoins part of the Lexicon development, with a police station and magistrates court located to the south. 6.118 The site is in a sustainable location at a key gateway to the Town Centre. In order for it to contribute to the Town Centre’s continued regeneration, comprehensive development of the site with a mixed-use scheme is sought. 87 88 89 Housing 6.119 The site is allocated for approximately 210 dwellings, of which 35% are to be affordable. 6.120 It is also expected that the development will incorporate a mix of dwelling types and sizes. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 16 'Affordable housing' and Policy LP 40 'Housing mix'. Employment 6.121 The site currently includes Easthampstead House (c. 3,900m 2 floorspace) and a library (c. 1,400m 2 floorspace). To help support the continuing regeneration and ongoing viability of Bracknell Town Centre, this policy seeks approximately 3,160m 2 net of office floorspace (Class E – restricted), 8,600m 2 of floorspace for use within Class E (minimum of 500m 2 unrestricted) and Class C1 (hotel use). This will provide flexibility for the market to deliver floorspace in uses which are in highest demand over the plan period and beyond. 6.122 The opportunity to retain and refurbish Easthampstead House should be investigated, as it may be suitable for continued employment use, residential or a hotel use. Library 6.123 If it is not feasible to replace the library on site, a library facility will need to be reprovided elsewhere within Bracknell Town Centre. Green infrastructure and open space 6.124 In developing a site wide masterplan, a holistic approach is required to protect, enhance and provide new green infrastructure (in line with Policy LP 30 'Green infrastructure'). Considerations for the masterplan include: the layout of OSPV within the site, including play and amenity areas; provision of SuDS; how biodiversity connectivity will be achieved including a green corridor network with access routes within and adjoining the site; and landscaping of the site. 6.125 OSPV is an important component of achieving a sustainable mixed-use scheme and taking opportunities to achieve net environmental gains. Provision should include attractive spaces within the site and fully integrated landscaping, open SuDS and biodiversity features in the public realm. Active and natural play spaces should be provided in the public realm (including for example, a skate bowl, ramps and a children’s play area). Usable communal and private amenity space for future residents should be incorporated in the site. Additionally, improvements in OSPV in and around Bracknell Town Centre will be sought that future residents will be able to access and enjoy. The layout and landscaping of the site should maximise opportunities for public and private amenity space. 90 6.126 Town Square is an existing area of open space within the site. New development should retain the original layout of the New Town’s civic quarter, in order to respect the New Town heritage. This should include replacement or provision of new public open space with integrated landscaping and green infrastructure connections, as part of a high quality public realm. Further details will be set out in a forthcoming ‘Bracknell Town Centre Masterplans’ Supplementary Planning Document. Mitigation for habitats sites 6.127 It will not be possible to develop and make effective use of the site if a SANG is provided on site. An off-site solution will need to be found as a requirement of any planning consent, which is likely to be provision from Bracknell Forest Council owned strategic SANG. The development will require a HRA at the application stage which must meet the requirements of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 (as amended). This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 32 'Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area' and Policy LP 31 'Designated nature conservation and geological sites'. Design and the public realm 6.128 It is essential that, in accordance with Policy LP 28 'Design principles', development of the site is design-led, positively contributing to placemaking from the outset. Constraints and opportunities should inform the layout of the site, ensuring a comprehensive and well-designed development that will successfully integrate into the wider area. The site should deliver a high quality public realm, based on a clear strategy for the site, including structural planting and landscaping to provide a pleasant living environment for all. 6.129 The site should create a sense of place with its own identity and character. The height, scale and form of the buildings must be carefully considered in order to contribute positively to the streetscene. As the site is highly visible from a key transport intersection, there are opportunities for landmark buildings and focal points within the development to signal the arrival and approach to the Town Centre, which should also respond to connections through the site, and level changes across the site. 6.130 The site provides a main pedestrian and cycle approach to the Town Centre from the east, and therefore it is expected that active and positive frontages will be provided within the development. Links connecting the site to the wider network and Town Centre are essential in order to maximise sustainable modes of travel and connectivity. This should seek to replace existing underpasses with street level crossings, in order to provide at grade connections. There is an opportunity for an ‘east-west’ link through the site, to create a pedestrian/cycle priority space (providing links into the wider Town Centre), incorporating Green Infrastructure and SuDs features, together with integrated landscaping which will contribute to the public realm. 6.131 New development must also retain the original layout of the New Town’s civic quarter to create a space with a community focus including seating, play opportunities and integrated landscaping. Active uses should be focused around the new square, and east-west linkway, in order to activate the public realm. The potential opportunity to retain and refurbish Easthampstead House as part of the New Town heritage should be explored as part of any development proposal. 6.132 Development of the site will require residential car parking to be accommodated in a manner that does not dominate the public realm. 91 6.133 In addition to being in a sustainable location, redevelopment of the site will make effective and efficient use of previously developed land (NPPF chapter 11). It is therefore essential that proposals for the site are design-led and informed by a masterplan. Further details will be set out in a forthcoming ‘Bracknell Town Centre Masterplans’ Supplementary Planning Document. Transport 6.134 Development of the site will need to take account of the outcome of a Transport Assessment which should include coverage of the impact of the site on Junction 10 of the M4 and Junctions 3 and 4 of the M3. 6.135 Highway improvements necessary to support development of the site include: Capacity improvements to nearby road junctions including Station Roundabout and the Met Office Roundabout. Improvements to footways to allow shared use providing better accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists to education facilities and the wider cycle track network. Improving public transport links to the wider area. Other infrastructure requirements 6.136 On- and off- site infrastructure, in accordance with the Infrastructure Delivery Plan, will be required to support the development. Infrastructure required to support the development may be secured through in-kind provision and/or through developer contributions. On-site waste recycling facilities will also need to be provided. This Policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 24 'Infrastructure'. Flooding and SuDs 6.137 Part of the site is at risk of surface water flooding. This is a material consideration and will need to inform the layout of the site from the outset. 6.138 When developing a site-wide masterplan, technical investigation and assessment of all sources of flooding should be undertaken to determine the flood risk management measures, and SuDS features required (including OSPV areas) in order to achieve sustainable development. This should meet the requirements for the site identified in the Level 2 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (JBA, 2019). 6.139 High quality public realm and OSPV should incorporate SuDS and buildings will be expected to include measures, such as green roofs, to capture water where it falls and ease drainage issues whilst contributing to enhancing biodiversity net gain on the site. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 33 'Flood risk' and Policy LP 57 'Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)'. 92 Biodiversity 6.140 The current use of the main part of the site (being PDL) does not lend itself to areas of high ecological value, although there is a group of trees in the eastern part of the development area. Redeveloping the site with a strong landscape strategy, including integrated green infrastructure throughout, should help improve air quality, benefit local health and wellbeing, promote biodiversity, and achieve at least a 10% BNG. A site management plan for at least 30 years after the development has been completed is also required to set out the programme of works needed to achieve restoration, enhancement and ongoing management of the site. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 53 'Biodiversity' and Policy LP 30 'Green infrastructure'. Trees 6.141 There are trees within the site which may need to be removed to accommodate development. A tree survey and arboricultural impact assessment, in accordance with British Standard 5837 ‘Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction’ (as may be amended or substituted) will be required. As far as possible, any existing trees of notable interest should be incorporated into the design of the proposal. 6.142 Development of the site should not compromise the long-term health of retained trees, which will need to be appropriately safeguarded during construction in accordance with British Standard 5837 ‘Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction’, as may be amended or substituted. Careful consideration will also need to be given to the drainage of the site, and placement of utilities. 6.143 Appropriate new tree planting (which may be individual or groups of trees to provide naturalistic features) as part of the landscaping of the site will be required, as part of a landscape strategy to connect the site to the wider landscape network, including at gateway locations, and focal areas within the site. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 54 'Protection and enhancement of trees and hedgerows'. Pollution 6.144 The site is located close to the highway network.This means that careful consideration needs to be given to noise and other pollution issues that might affect the health and wellbeing of future residents. Due to the proximity of the site to main roads, it will be necessary to undertake and take account of an acoustic report. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 58 'Pollution and hazards'. Other matters 6.145 As the Development Plan should be read as a whole, regard will need to be had to all relevant adopted planning policies (including any in the Bracknell Town Neighbourhood Plan, and the Joint Minerals and Waste Plan), together with Supplementary Planning Guidance, in the consideration of this site. It is recommended that a pre-application proposal is submitted for consideration prior to the submission of a planning application. 93 KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (Chapter 5 Delivering a sufficient supply of homes; Chapter 8 Promoting healthy and safe communities; Chapter 11 Making effective use of land; Chapter 12 Achieving well-designed places) PPG (Effective use of land; Housing needs of different groups; Design: process and tools) Housing Background Paper (BFC) (This provides an overview of the relevant evidence base for the site) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. The site is in single ownership, some site clearance will be required prior to commencement of development. It is envisaged that housing could start to be delivered in 2030/31. Depending on market conditions and other factors, it is estimated that the development will take four years to complete (see Appendix 1: 'Housing Trajectory and Five Year Housing Land Supply'). 94 6.7 Southern Gateway Development Area, Bracknell 6.146 The site comprises a number of parcels of land in single ownership (owned by Bracknell Forest Council). It is a partly developed site in a sustainable location, within the boundary of Bracknell Town Centre. It comprises the existing Bus Station, Jubilee Gardens and Station Green (areas of formal public open space), and an area of grassed open space. 6.147 The overall site is bisected by two roads (the Ring running east-west and Station Road running north-south). The northern boundary of the site adjoins the Town Centre. Other boundaries of the site are formed by roads (Market Street to the west and south, and Station Way to the east). 6.148 The site is in a sustainable location at a key gateway to the Town Centre. In order for it to contribute to the Town Centre’s continued regeneration, comprehensive development of the site with a mixed-use scheme is sought. 95 96 97 98 Housing 6.149 The site is allocated for approximately 600 dwellings, of which 35% are to be affordable. 6.150 It is also expected that the development will incorporate a mix of dwelling types and sizes. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 16 'Affordable housing' and Policy LP 40 'Housing mix'. Employment 6.151 The site currently includes a retail use at the Bus Station (site BRA17) (c. 225m 2 floorspace). To help support the continuing regeneration and ongoing viability of Bracknell Town Centre, this policy seeks approximately 22,300m 2 of office floorspace (Class E – restricted), and 1,500m 2 of floorspace for use within Class E (unrestricted). This will provide flexibility for the market to deliver floorspace in uses which are in highest demand over the plan period and beyond. Green infrastructure and open space 6.152 In developing a site-wide masterplan, a holistic approach is required to protect, enhance and provide new green infrastructure (in line with Policy LP 30 'Green infrastructure'). Considerations for the masterplan include: the layout of OSPV within the site, including play and amenity areas; provision of SuDS; how biodiversity connectivity will be achieved including a green corridor network with access routes within and adjoining the site; and landscaping of the site. 6.153 OSPV is an important component of achieving a sustainable mixed-use scheme and taking opportunities to achieve net environmental gains. Provision should include a green corridor within the site and fully integrated landscaping, open SuDS and biodiversity features in the public realm. Active and natural play spaces should be provided in the public realm (including for example, a skate bowl, ramps and a children’s play area). Usable communal and private amenity space for future residents should be incorporated in the site. Additionally, improvements in OSPV in and around Bracknell Town Centre will be sought that future residents will be able to access and enjoy. The layout and landscaping of the site should maximise opportunities for public and private amenity space. 6.154 Station Green at the western part of the site was provided as an open space of public value which was intended to replace the open space at Jubilee Gardens which was previously identified for redevelopment. Further work has indicated that it would be more beneficial to retain the open space at Jubilee Gardens, closer to the Town Centre and place development on the Station Green site. There is also an opportunity to create a vibrant public space at the heart of the development in the form of a new community square, forming part of the north-south link through the site. This should include integrated landscaping and green infrastructure connections, as part of a high quality public realm. 99 6.155 Jubilee Gardens is located in the northern part of the site. It contains mature trees and seating, and its area is approximately 0.51ha. As part of the development of the site, this space should be retained and enhanced, including the provision of a new play space. Enhancements should ensure that this part of the site provides both a physical and visual link to the wider site and Town Centre. This should include integrated landscaping and green infrastructure connections, as part of a high quality public realm. Further details will be set out in a forthcoming ‘Bracknell Town Centre Masterplans’ Supplementary Planning Document. Mitigation for habitats sites 6.156 It will not be possible to develop and make effective use of the site if a SANG is provided on site. An off-site solution will need to be found as a requirement of any planning consent, which is likely to be provision from Bracknell Forest Council owned strategic SANG. The development will require a HRA at the application stage which must meet the requirements of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 (as amended). This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 32 'Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area' and Policy LP 31 'Designated nature conservation and geological sites'. Design and the public realm 6.157 It is essential that in accordance with Policy LP 28 'Design principles' development of the site is design-led, positively contributing to placemaking from the outset. Constraints and opportunities should inform the layout of the site, ensuring a comprehensive and well-designed development that will successfully integrate into the wider area. The site should deliver a high quality public realm, based on a clear strategy for the site, including structural planting and landscaping to provide a pleasant living environment for all. 6.158 The site should create a sense of place with its own identity and character. The height, scale and form of the buildings must be carefully considered in order to contribute positively to the streetscene. As the site is highly visible from a key transport intersection, there are opportunities for landmark buildings and focal points within the development to signal the arrival and approach to the Town Centre, which should also respond to connections through the site, and level changes across the site. 6.159 The site provides an opportunity to create a main pedestrian and cycle approach to the Town Centre from the railway station to the south, and therefore it is expected that active and positive frontages will be provided within the development. Links connecting the site to the wider network and Town Centre are essential in order to maximise sustainable modes of travel and connectivity. This should seek to replace existing underpasses with street level crossings, in order to provide at grade connections. There is an opportunity for a ‘north-south’ link through the site, to create a pedestrian/cycle priority space (providing links into the wider Town Centre), incorporating Green Infrastructure and SuDs features, together with integrated landscaping which will contribute to the public realm. 6.160 New development must also retain and refurbish Jubilee Gardens, and create a new focal open space area. Active uses should be focused around the new open spaces, and the north-south linkway, in order to activate the public realm. 6.161 Development of the site will require residential car parking to be accommodated in a manner that does not dominate the public realm. 100 6.162 Being in a sustainable location, redevelopment of the site will make effective and efficient use of land. It is therefore essential that proposals for the site are design-led and informed by a masterplan. Further details will be set out in a forthcoming ‘Bracknell Town Centre Masterplans’ Supplementary Planning Document. Bus Station 6.163 Redevelopment of the site will involve land comprising the existing bus station. New bus interchange facilities will need to be provided such as on-street bus stops along Station Way, Station Road and Market Street, other set down stops, with bus station facilities to be re-provided within or close to the development. This should include the provision of a multi-modal public transport hub for rail, bus and taxi services. Development proposals should ensure that direct and legible connections through the site to the Town Centre and public transport locations are maintained and integrated into the site layout. Transport 6.164 Development of the site will need to take account of the outcome of a Transport Assessment which should include coverage of the impact of the site on Junction 10 of the M4 and Junctions 3 and 4 of the M3. 6.165 Highway improvements necessary to support development of the site include: Capacity improvements to nearby road junctions including Station Roundabout and the Met Office Roundabout. Improvements to footways to allow shared use providing better accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists to education facilities and the wider cycle track network. Improving public transport links to the wider area. Other infrastructure requirements 6.166 On- and off- site infrastructure, in accordance with the Infrastructure Delivery Plan, will be required to support the development. Infrastructure required to support the development may be secured through in-kind provision and/or through developer contributions. On-site waste recycling facilities will also need to be provided. This Policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 24 'Infrastructure'. Flooding and SuDs 6.167 Part of the site is at risk of surface water flooding, with high ground water levels occurring across parts of the site. Some areas at risk of surface water flooding also coincide with areas of high ground water levels. These are material considerations and will need to inform the layout of the site from the outset. Development of the site should avoid areas at risk of flooding and high groundwater. Suitable sustainable drainage systems should be provided to mitigate the impact of the development. 6.168 When developing a site-wide masterplan, technical investigation and assessment of all sources of flooding should be undertaken to determine flood risk management measures and SuDS features required (including OSPV areas), in order to achieve sustainable development. This should meet the requirements for the site identified in the Level 2 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (JBA, 2019). 101 6.169 High quality public realm and OSPV should incorporate SuDS and buildings will be expected to include measures, such as green roofs, to capture water where it falls and ease drainage issues whilst contributing to enhancing biodiversity net gain on the site. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 33 'Flood risk' and Policy LP 57 'Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)'. Biodiversity 6.170 Parts of the site (being PDL and semi-improved grass land) do not lend themselves to areas of high ecological value. The area of trees within Jubilee Gardens is of moderate ecological value. A benefit of redeveloping the site with a strong landscape strategy, including integrated green infrastructure throughout, is that the site can help improve air quality, benefit local health and wellbeing, promote biodiversity, and achieve at least a 10% BNG. A site management plan for at least 30 years after development has been completed is also required to set out the programme of works needed to achieve restoration, enhancement and ongoing management of the site. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 53 'Biodiversity' and Policy LP 30 'Green infrastructure'. Trees 6.171 There are trees within the site which may need to be removed to accommodate development, although it is expected that mature trees within Jubilee Gardens should be retained where possible. A tree survey and arboricultural impact assessment in accordance with British Standard 5837 ‘Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction’ (as may be amended or substituted) will be required. As far as possible, any existing trees of notable interest should be incorporated into the design of the proposal. 6.172 Development of the site should not compromise the long-term health of retained trees, which will need to be appropriately safeguarded during construction in accordance with British Standard 5837 ‘Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction’, as may be amended or substituted. Careful consideration will also need to be given to the drainage of the site and placement of utilities. 6.173 Appropriate new tree planting (which may be individual or groups of trees to provide naturalistic features) as part of the landscaping of the site will be required, as part of a landscape strategy to connect the site to the wider landscape network, including at gateway locations and focal areas within the site. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 54 'Protection and enhancement of trees and hedgerows'. Heritage 6.174 Market Inn, a locally listed building, is located to the south of the site on Market Street, opposite the train station. The significance of this heritage asset needs to be protected from harm and opportunities will be sought to conserve and enhance its significance in line with Policy LP 29 'Conservation and enhancement of the historic environment'. Development proposals should be accompanied by a Heritage Statement to support and demonstrate a clear understanding of the significance of the setting of the heritage asset and how its significance would be affected. 102 Pollution and potential for contamination 6.175 The site is located close to the highway network.This means that careful consideration needs to be given to noise and other pollution issues that might affect the health and wellbeing of future residents. Due to the proximity of the site to main roads and the railway line, it will be necessary to undertake and take account of an acoustic report. 6.176 Due to proximity to the AQMA (to the south of the site along Bagshot Road), it will also be necessary to undertake and take account of an air quality assessment to assess the impact of the AQMA on the health of future residents. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 58 'Pollution and hazards'. 6.177 Due to the addition of sensitive land uses on the site, it will also be necessary to assess the potential for contamination within the site in accordance with Policy LP 59 'Development of land potentially affected by contamination'. Other matters 6.178 As the Development Plan should be read as a whole, regard will need to be had to all relevant adopted planning policies (including any in the Bracknell Town Neighbourhood Plan, and the Joint Minerals and Waste Plan), together with Supplementary Planning Guidance, in the consideration of this site. It is recommended that a pre-application proposal is submitted for consideration prior to the submission of a planning application.

This may include new and innovative approaches to provision that require all involved in the housing market to work together. The following sections therefore set out the framework for allowing this to happen and consider affordable housing, accommodation for older people, self build and custom build, and provision for gypsies, travellers and travelling showpeople. 119 6.14 Affordable housing 6.185 The NPPF (para. 62) states that local authorities should make provision for those who require affordable housing in their area. Insufficient affordable housing can have detrimental effects on the economic and social health of the area. It is an important consideration in the creation of sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities. The majority of affordable housing in the Borough is achieved by requiring developers to provide affordable homes as part of open market housing developments (through section 106 agreements). 120 121 6.186 The Bracknell Forest Housing Needs Assessment (July 2020) [(35)] indicates a significant need for affordable housing in the Borough. A total need of 338 affordable homes per year (taking account of the pipeline supply at 1st April 2019) is calculated split between 232 units of rented affordable homes and 106 affordable home ownership products. This represents a considerable percentage of the overall housing provision and the Council has to consider the implications of meeting such a level of need on the viability of new housing development. This was carried out through the Local Plan Viability Assessment which tested different levels of on-site affordable housing provision to provide an indication of the likely viability of affordable housing provision. The site size threshold (which follows national guidance) and required level of affordable housing target are set at the level proposed, in order to achieve an appropriate balance between meeting much of the need within the Borough, whilst ensuring the delivery of other important elements such as infrastructure and the maintenance of a sustainable housing market which will deliver the range of housing needed to help meet market demand as well affordable. Proposals which provide a higher amount of affordable housing than that set out above will also be permitted. 6.187 The weight given to any viability assessment submitted alongside a planning application which seeks to differ in the affordable housing contribution from the policy position of 35% with the appropriate tenure split will be a matter for the Council. In such cases the relaxation of normal requirements will only be considered where there are costs associated with a particular site which could not have been envisaged at the plan-making stage or where circumstances have changed since the plan was adopted. 6.188 In such instances a detailed viability assessment must be submitted which will be made publicly available in the interests of transparency. This will need to reflect the recommended approach in national planning guidance, including standardised inputs. Where this is agreed it will also be necessary for the viability assessment to undertake modelling of various affordable housing options, rather than relying on an assumption that no affordable housing can be provided. This viability assessment shall be verified by an independent consultant chosen by the Council at the developer’s expense. Where any concessions are agreed for viability reasons, the section 106 Agreement will be expected to include claw-back provisions, and an independent assessor appointed at the developer’s expense to monitor the scheme on an open-book basis against the claw-back provisions. 6.189 Where the affordable housing policy would result in a requirement that part of an affordable home should be provided, a financial contribution of equivalent value will be sought. 6.190 The Housing Needs Assessment (July 2020) makes it clear that the priority need is for rented affordable housing. Within the overall affordable housing provision, 69% is required to be delivered as rented affordable housing to meet the needs of households who do not have other housing options. A 50/50 split in provision is indicated between social rent and affordable rent. Affordability of the latter is to be linked to the Local Housing Allowance (LHA) [(36)] and take account of service charges. 6.191 The remaining 31% of the overall housing provision will comprise affordable home ownership products. These may be shared ownership, discounted market sales or, starter homes. Their cost should be genuinely affordable in the context of Bracknell Forest based upon a household not spending more than 35% of its income on housing. 35 http://consult.bracknell - [forest.gov.uk/file/5819854](http://consult.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/file/5819854) 36 https://www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/benefits - and - [support/housing](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/benefits-and-support/housing-benefit/local-housing-allowance) - benefit/local - housing - allowance 122 6.192 The split between affordable homes is illustrated below: |Table 10 Percentage split between tenures|Col2|Col3| |||| |35% affordable homes||| |69% affordable homes for rent||31% affordable home ownership products| |50% social rent|50% affordable rent capped at LHA|| 6.193 The table above reflects the overall need in terms of tenure split based on the HNA (2020). The Council is keen to ensure the delivery of affordable housing products that meet this overall need. However, the Local Plan Viability Assessment indicates that sites in and immediately around Bracknell Town Centre may not be sufficiently viable to provide preferred tenure mix. For sites in and immediately around Bracknell Town Centre, which would otherwise be unviable, there will be flexibility to vary the mix of tenures set out in Table 10 'Percentage split between tenures' of this Local Plan in order to achieve 35% of affordable homes overall, or as close to that figure as possible. This flexibility will be subject to an independent assessment of an open book financial appraisal of the development provided by the applicant. 6.194 Bracknell Forest Council is the owner of several such sites and may accept a lower land value than is assumed in the viability appraisal in order to meet its policy objective of increasing the supply of affordable housing. 6.195 In other locations, the Council may also consider alternative negotiated mixes of tenure on a site-specific basis in the interests of addressing specific local needs. Further details will be set out in a forthcoming Housing Supplementary Planning Document. 6.196 Affordable homes should be built to National Affordable Housing Programme requirements and should not be distinguishable from market housing in terms of overall size, type, design details, build quality and materials. To help ensure that the size and types of affordable homes are appropriate to meet the requirements of the local community, the Council will take into account the latest evidence from the Housing Register and monitoring of other data sources. The high level of need for family homes is reflected in the higher average waiting times on the Housing Register for those in need of larger properties. Further, over 40% of the 1 bedroom need on the Housing Register is in the lowest need category whereas those registered for family housing are largely in more urgent need. Annual lettings data over the past four years (including new lets and re-lets) illustrates that significantly fewer 3 bedroom or larger properties become available relative to need. 6.197 It will be important to avoid affordable dwellings being overly concentrated in only a few areas of a development. Dispersal and integration will be sought across the development. Methods for achieving this will be set out in a forthcoming Housing Supplementary Planning Document. 123 6.198 Affordable housing should normally be provided on-site. Provision off-site, or through a commuted sum payment in lieu, will only be considered where it will be of broadly equivalent value to on-site provision and it can be robustly justified in delivering affordable homes through mixed and balanced communities. Exceptional circumstances include when a Registered Provider has demonstrated, by means of evidence agreed with the Council, that it would not be practical to deliver or manage on-site affordable housing. Once an exceptional circumstance is agreed the options are: to provide a significantly larger number of affordable homes off site on an alternative site provided by the developer, or, to make a financial contribution (payment in lieu) equivalent to the maximum reasonable affordable housing and associated land value that could be provided on site as assessed through a viability assessment. 6.199 Where a proposal site is subject to phasing, is sub-divided, or where there is a reasonable prospect of adjoining land coming forward for residential development, the Council may consider the site(s) taken as a whole for the purpose of determining the appropriate affordable housing provisions. This will be particularly relevant if it is clear that a proposal has been formulated with a view to circumventing affordable housing requirements. 6.200 As part of residential development proposals, where vacant buildings are brought back into any lawful use, or are demolished to be replaced by new buildings, the affordable housing requirement for the proposal will be discounted by a proportion equivalent to the existing gross floorspace of the vacant buildings unless the requirement to do so is removed or moderated by a change in national policy or guidance.

The Annex 2 Glossary indicates that these are people over or approaching retirement age.They will include the active elderly at one end of the scale and the very frail elderly at the other. Future need 6.202 Demographic projections set out in the Bracknell Forest Housing Needs Assessment (July 2020) (HNA) [(37)] indicate that the population of Bracknell Forest is likely to increase by 18,800 over the period 2019 – 2036. Within this total, the number of people aged 65 and over is estimated to increase by 10,400 people or 55% of the total projected population change. 6.203 Data drawn from the 2011 Census suggests that those people in the oldest age bands are also more likely to have a Long Term Health Problem or Disability (LTHPD). It will therefore be important to ensure that new mainstream housing aimed at meeting some of the current and future needs of the ageing population is accessible and adaptable and includes wheelchair housing. This issue is considered further in Part 2 of the Plan under Policy LP 38 'Accessible and adaptable dwellings'. 6.204 Whilst many older households will prefer to continue to live in mainstream housing, given the substantial growth in the population of older people, there is likely to be a need for a range of specialist housing. The level of care required will vary significantly between people 37 consult.bracknell - [forest.gov.uk/file/5819854](https://consult.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/file/5819854) 125 of similar ages and over time. A range of models are considered in the HNA including the following which are categorised according to whether they involve support or care (the amount may vary depending on the nature of the scheme): Retirement living or sheltered housing (housing with support) Enhanced sheltered housing (housing with care) Extra care housing or housing-with-care (housing with care) Residential care homes and nursing homes (care bedspaces) 6.205 However, over the plan period different housing models may emerge as the market for older person’s housing and care needs matures. 6.206 This in turn may impact on the quantum of demand. As such, it is not possible to determine a definitive quantum of development required for housing for older people, nor to set out in a prescriptive manner how it should be satisfied. Nonetheless, if the conclusions of the HNA are adjusted for the plan period and to take account of commitments at 31st March 2023, the indicative need for specialist housing for older people in Bracknell Forest is as set out in the Tables below.

Where permissions specify the number of bedspaces, the equivalent no. of dwellings, has been calculated by dividing the number of bedspaces by 1.8, rounded to nearest whole number. This is in accordance with paragraph 11 of the Housing Delivery Test Measurement Rule Book [:assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1012931/HDT_Measurement_Rule_Book.pdf) _ data/file/1012931/HDT _ Measurement _ Ru l e _ B o o k .pdf ) 127 6.207 Analysis of the data also indicates that the tenure profile of need for housing with support (such as sheltered and retirement housing) is principally for leasehold provision (97%). For housing with care (such as extra care schemes), 60% of the need is for leasehold and 40% for rented provision. 6.208 The HNA also estimates the need for additional residential care and nursing home bedspaces. After having adjusted the figures (for the plan period and commitments at 31st March 2023), the indicative need is 730 bedspaces. This is considered to be an approximate level of need as there is potential for some of this need to be met through the provision of extra care schemes, depending on the delivery of such schemes. An analysis of commitments over the last 5 years substantiates this as it shows that 48% of all completions falling within Use Class C2 have been extra care. 6.209 The HNA also states that the ultimate level of provision the Council seeks to support will be influenced by its broader strategy for older persons housing and care. 6.210 The Council’s Older Persons Accommodation and Support Strategy [(38)] sets out to meet four key objectives including: Objective 3: Strategically plan sustainable housing that meets the needs and aspirations of older people now and in the future; Objective 4: Support older people to live independently, in all tenures and extend the availability of preventative services. 6.211 Through implementing these objectives the Council wishes to: i. Help more people to live for longer in their own homes; ii. Deliver more flexible support and care to enable independence; iii. Create more opportunities for older people to live in accommodation of their choice; and iv. Enable older people to feel safe and secure in their homes and neighbourhoods. 6.212 Against this background, the Local Plan seeks to help meet needs by requiring strategic sites, where suitable environments can be created, to contribute towards a range of attractive housing options for older people. In terms of the Use Classes Order, it is likely that some of this accommodation will come forward as Use Class C3 (residential dwelling house) and some as Use Class C2 (residential institutions), depending on market factors.The Council's preference is for extra care and enhanced sheltered which tend to fall within Use Class C2. These schemes have the capacity to deliver flexible twenty four hour care from an on-site care team, based on individual need that can increase or decrease according to circumstances. 6.213 A review of planning commitments data for specialist housing, also shows that a number of schemes on sites in the urban area come forward as 'windfall' development through the development management process. The integration of specialist housing within the wider housing stock will help to ensure that there is a wide choice and mix of housing types and tenures, that provide an attractive choice for those who wish to downsize or move to more age-appropriate housing. In order to satisfy demand, it is likely that developers/providers will continue to identify sites for such proposals. A development management policy is therefore included in Part 2 dealing with locational criteria as where a scheme is located influences the degree of community integration and involvement and ease of access for staff and visitors such as relatives/friends. 38 www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2021 - 11/older - [persons](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2021-11/older-persons-accommodation-and-support-strategy-2011-to-2026.pdf) - accommodation - and - support - strategy - 2011 - to - 2026.pdf 128 6.214 The quantum and type of specialist older persons accommodation to be provided at Policy LP 6 'Land at Beaufort Park, Nine Mile Ride, Bracknell (BRA4)', Policy LP 7 'Land east of Wokingham Road and south of Dukes Ride (Derby Field), Crowthorne (SAND5)' and Policy LP 8 'The Peel Centre and The Point, Skimped Hill Lane, Bracknell (BRA18)' will be agreed as part of the master planning process (in accordance with Policy LP 28 'Design principles'). DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. 129 6.16 Self build, custom build and gypsy and travellers and travelling showpeople Custom build and self build 6.215 The need to plan for a mix of housing to address the needs of different groups in the community includes people wishing to commission or build their own homes. Custom build and self build are the two types of project most commonly referred to. They are as follows: Custom build: the eventual occupiers take on a “project management” role, coordinating the services of designers, architects, planners and construction staff.They may get actively involved in some aspects, but generally physical involvement is kept to a minimum. Self build : the occupiers take on an active role, procuring, designing and building their own home. They may outsource elements of the project, where their skills or time do not allow it. 6.216 The Self-build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 (as amended by the Housing and Planning Act 2016), requires the Council to maintain a custom and self-build homes register to establish the level of need for this type of housing. The Council must have regard to this in fulfilling its planning and housing functions. In August 2020, there was 1 Association and 84 individuals registering an interest. 6.217 Self build and custom build plots can be delivered in a number of ways, ranging from multiple individual serviced plots within large developments to single or small sites identified by individuals or by town and parish councils through the neighbourhood plan process. 6.218 In order to meet the need identified on Bracknell Forest's Self and Custom Build Register, and, taking into account the nature of strategic sites, 5% of the overall dwellings shall be provided through the provision of serviced plots for sale to address local self or custom build need on Policy LP 6 'Land at Beaufort Park, Nine Mile Ride, Bracknell (BRA4)' and Policy LP 7 'Land east of Wokingham Road and south of Dukes Ride (Derby Field), Crowthorne (SAND5)'. This does not prevent smaller scale proposals for self build and custom build housing coming forward on smaller sites as has historically been the case. They will be assessed on their own merits in the light of the prevailing policies in the Plan and any other material considerations. 6.219 A legal agreement will be used to secure the delivery of self build and custom build plots. Planning applications including such schemes should be supported with a marketing strategy for the self-build plots on the application site and other measures intended to ensure effective engagement with the community and parties on the self-build register. If plots are not taken up by the public after being marketed for an appropriate time (to be agreed with the Council through the granting of planning permission for the site), consideration will be given to allowing them to revert to conventional build plots. The planning obligation will set out the circumstances under which the requirement to deliver self-build/custom build plots will be relaxed or released. 130 Gypsies, travellers and travelling showpeople 6.220 The Council's Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment 2022 (GTAA) established an overall ‘cultural’ need for pitches which accords with the overall need for the travelling community, taking into account the Human Rights Act 1998, and the Equalities Act 2010 which protects the cultural choice of gypsies and travellers to live in mobile accommodation. The Housing and Planning Act 2016 section 124 also makes specific reference to the needs of households living in caravans. Accordingly there is a need to plan for this type of accommodation. 6.221 The overall scale of need for gypsy, traveller and travelling showpeople accommodation in Bracknell Forest is small compared with wider housing needs. Using the assumptions set out in the GTAA (taking account of turnover), the need in the Borough over the period 2021/22 - 2036/37 is for: eight gypsy and traveller pitches. This can be broken down into: four gypsy and traveller pitches in the first five years of the plan period; four gypsy and traveller pitches during the period 2026/27 to 2036/37; five plots for travelling showpeople; and the need to give consideration to options for transit provision in response to unauthorised encampment activity. 6.222 The Council intends to meet the need for gypsy and traveller pitches. At the time of writing, the Council is considering an application for four retrospective pitches, which involve the intensification of an existing authorised site and if approved would address the short-term need for pitches. Whilst the four pitches are currently unauthorised, they have already been delivered on the site and are available to meet the Borough’s five year supply in full. The application seeks to regularise the existing use and there is no in-principle objection to permission being granted. Table 13 Short term Gypsy and Traveller permanent pitch needs |Short term need|Col2|Need| |||| |5 year authorised pitch shortfall (from GTAA, 2022)|2021/22 to 2025/26|7| |Anticipated turnover on Council site||3| |Residual need 2021/22 to 2025/26 after turnover||4| |Supply of pitches|Retrospective planning application 19/00491/FUL|4| |Total unmet need in 5 year period||0| 131 6.223 Where windfall sites are submitted to meet identified needs later in the plan period, these will be determined in accordance with Policy LP 41 'Gypsies, travellers and travelling showpeople '. 6.224 No suitable transit sites were submitted through the SHELAA, consultations or other reviews. As a similar need has been highlighted in neighbouring Authorities, the Council will continue to explore opportunities to meet this need outside the Borough. 6.225 Development management Policy LP 41 'Gypsies, travellers and travelling showpeople ' sets out specific criteria which will be used to assess applications that may come forward and seeks to safeguard existing sites. 132 7: Economic development 7.1 Provision of employment floorspace 7.1 The Government’s 2017 Industrial Strategy emphasises supporting businesses to create better, higher paid jobs with investment in the skills, industries and infrastructure of the future. Four ‘Grand Challenges’ are identified to put the UK at the forefront of industries of the future. Two of these challenges involve maximising the advantages for UK industry from the global shift to clean growth (which includes high efficiency agriculture) and putting the UK at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) and data revolution (which includes working with industry to develop innovative uses of AI and advanced analytic technologies). These aspirations have been further embedded in the UK Innovation Strategy (2021). 7.2 The Berkshire Local Enterprise Partnership published its Berkshire Local Industrial Strategy (BLIS) in October 2020 [(39)] . This highlights the importance of the Life Sciences and Information Technology Sectors to Berkshire.The BLIS has a vision that ‘Berkshire should grow with ambition and intent to harness the best of both global and local’. From this it identifies six overarching ‘priorities’ to create a sustainable economy. One priority identified is to look at ways of enhancing productivity within Berkshire’s enterprises. A further priority is to foster relationships and inter dependencies linked to economic life which are considered to be weaker than in some areas outside Berkshire. It identifies certain organisations and sites to act as institutional anchors is to be investigated. Specific reference is made to the global research and development centre for Agro-chemical research operated by Syngenta at Jealott’s Hill. As this strategy is implemented, the Local Plan can help support opportunities for long-term economic growth in these sectors. 7.3 A theme of the Council’s Plan [(40)] is for Bracknell Forest to have a 'thriving and connected economy', including the ambition that businesses have the space, environment and support to adapt and grow. 7.4 At the time of the 2011 Census Bracknell Forest’s labour market was broadly in balance with a very small outflow of 2,500 persons which is not considered significant. Since the 2011 Census ONS has provided new ‘experimental’ Job Density Statistics which looks to update the commuting balance between areas by looking at the ratio of the number of jobs per resident aged 16-64. This data shows that in 2011 there was a ratio of 0.88 jobs for each resident of working age in Bracknell Forest.This ratio has remained broadly stable with the ONS reporting 0.89 in 2019. This would suggest Bracknell Forest remains broadly in balance with the same ratio as seen nationally and in the wider South East. However, this ignores the fact that nationally and regionally the ratios have shifted approximately 10% between the 2011 Census and today. Bracknell Forest has not seen a similar shift, which suggests that over time the workplace imbalance between Bracknell Forest and its nearby Housing Market may have worsened. It is likely that at least some of the job growth seen in the core of the Thames Valley has attracted more commuting in from Bracknell Forest and this in turn has not allowed Bracknell Forest’s own ratio to improve. However, it remains the case that there are enough jobs to support the size of the workforce aged 16-64 and there is no suggestion that Bracknell Forest has a significant issue or concern with commuting. The Council is keen to support existing businesses and wishes the area to grow in a sustainable way. 39 [http://www.thamesvalleyberkshire.co.uk/getfile/documents/Berkshire%20Local%20Industrial%20Strategy%20](http://www.thamesvalleyberkshire.co.uk/getfile/documents/Berkshire%20Local%20Industrial%20Strategy%20-%20Framework%20Document.pdf) - %20Framework%20Document.pdf 40 https://www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/council - and - [democracy/strategies](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/strategies-plans-and-policies/council-plan-2023-2027) - plans - and - policies/council - plan - 2023 - 2027 133 7.5 For the purpose of development proposals in defined settlements, employment development is defined as offices, general industrial, and storage or warehousing and distribution together with any Sui Generis uses that share a significant number of characteristics with those uses (see Policy LP 35 'Development in the countryside' for the employment definition applied outside of defined settlements). However, economic development covers a broader range of uses including employment development and 'Main Town Centre' uses. For clarity, 'economic development' is therefore taken as including office, industrial and storage (warehousing and distribution), retail, leisure, entertainment and more intensive sport and recreation uses, arts, culture and tourism development. Other economic development, in particular retail, is set out in Section 7.4 'Hierarchy of centres'. Employment development 7.6 Employment Commitments [(41)] data shows a continuing reduction in the stock of the former B1 floorspace with an increase in the existing stock of B2 and B8 floorspace. Overall, there was a net reduction of -26,450m 2 of former B1, B2 and B8 floorspace over the period 2020-2022. This was mainly due to a net loss of former B1 floorspace of -28,878m 2 . The total outstanding permissions for employment floorspace (including former B1, B2 and B8) amount to -40,425m 2 (net) of floorspace. Much of the loss of the former B1 floorspace has been due to the use of Permitted Development Rights (PDR) allowing the change of use from offices to residential. A key driver has been the difference between residential values and office values, particularly those for lower grade office space. From 1st August 2021, there has been a change in national thresholds. It is not yet known how changes to permitted development rights and the Use Class Order will affect supply. The position will need to be monitored. Designated Employment Areas 7.7 These areas contain established concentrations of office, industrial and warehousing development with supporting infrastructure, the larger areas around Bracknell being well located in respect of strategic transport routes.These designated Employment Areas provide the home to many multi-national companies and thousands of smaller ones that contribute to the buoyant local economy. It is recognised that some diversification of uses is required in terms of those uses that directly benefit or serve the people working in these locations. However it is important to safeguard their employment generating role and maintain an appropriate supply of employment land through the redevelopment and intensification of existing sites and premises to make more efficient use of sites, provide modern premises, and a range of units in size, type and configuration. 7.8 The Council has reviewed the boundaries of its designated Employment Areas to account for changes in circumstances such as allocations in previous plans and other developments that have taken place particularly through permitted development rights. It has concluded that the five designated Employment Areas listed in the policy below and shown on the Policies Map need to be protected. 41 https://www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/planning - and - building - [control/planning/planning](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy/monitoring/economy-and-employment-monitoring) - policy/monitoring/economy - and - employment - monitoring 134 42 Ancillary services are defined in paragraph 7.17 135 7.9 The Borough’s designated Employment Areas are important locations of business focus and opportunity, with the designated Employment Areas around Bracknell in particular, providing space for more extensive industrial, storage and distribution uses. It is important that the economic function of these areas is protected and strengthened. 7.10 They also offer opportunities for regeneration and intensification; there are several sites in designated Employment Areas where this could be achieved. For the purposes of this policy, the term 'business' is considered to cover office, research and development and light industrial uses. The Employment Land Needs Study confirms that there is a need to protect these areas since sites are vulnerable to pressure from alternative higher value uses.Their cumulative loss would have an adverse impact on the ability of businesses to establish, expand or relocate and might generate pressure to release land in less acceptable locations. The retention of the designated Employment Areas reflects the NPPF advice that planning policies and decisions should help create the conditions within which businesses can invest, expand and adapt. 7.11 There may also be opportunities for employment development which have not been specifically identified and are not located in existing established employment locations. 7.12 A challenge to the integrity of these areas has resulted from The Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020 that came into force on 1st September 2020. This resulted in the revocation of Use Classes A, B1 and D and the creation of a new Class E (commercial, business, and service). The changes brought together former A1 (shops), A2 (financial and professional services), A3 (restaurants and cafes) and B1 (business) as well as parts of Classes D1 (non-residential institutions) and D2 (assembly and leisure) into one single new E Use Class. Changes of use between the different types of uses listed in Class E do not constitute development and so do not require planning permission.They cannot be restricted through the use of Article 4 Directions. Whilst this weakens the Council’s ability to protect the integrity of the designated Employment Areas, it is considered appropriate to retain references to uses that fall within Use Class E to cover circumstances when planning permission is required. 7.13 It is possible that buildings used for business purposes could change to uses such as retail and leisure. Protecting the supply of floorspace is important to meet the needs of new and expanding businesses that may not be able to compete with alternative higher value uses. Some alternative uses may not be compatible with the established surrounding uses and could adversely affect the role and continuing viability of designated Employment Areas.The Council will monitor the position and may use conditions and/or planning obligations to restrict new floor-space to business uses within Class E, in order to achieve policy objectives. 136 7.14 The NPPF promotes a sequential approach to ‘main town centre uses’, which includes offices. This means that they should in the first instance be directed to Bracknell Town Centre and other centres. This is in order to promote and support particularly Bracknell Town Centre as a focus of economic and cultural activity due to its sustainable location and the need to support its vitality and continuing renewal. However, some office occupiers may have specific market and locational requirements that mean they are better located in the designated Employment Areas. Office development within the designated Employment Areas may facilitate clusters or networks of knowledge and data-driven, creative or high technology businesses. As such, new office development within the designated Employment Areas will be exempt from the sequential test. 7.15 The loss of BIDS uses has the potential to have a significant impact on the quality and character of the area and the ability of the Borough to achieve employment growth. In order to have sites available that can flexibly accommodate the changing needs of business over the coming years it is important that the integrity of these areas is protected. 7.16 In order to justify non-BIDS uses in designated Employment Areas, Part 4 of the policy requires several factors to be considered. Applicants will need to consider the impact of the proposal on the supply of BIDS floorspace in terms of outstanding planning commitments, take up and the amount of vacant floorspace, provide evidence of the length of time the property has been unused for BIDS purposes and show that the site has been effectively and continuously marketed for BIDS uses (including the possibility of redevelopment) for at least 12 consecutive months. Such evidence should document where the property has been publicly marketed including publications and property journals, details of advertisements on site, prices at which the land and buildings have been marketed during this period, (which should be at a price commensurate with market values based on evidence from recent and similar transactions and deals in the locality), a list of all expressions of interest during this period and an evaluation of why it is considered that the property has failed to attract interest from potential occupiers or for redevelopment for BIDS uses. It will also be necessary to address the relative suitability of the site for the alternative use compared with a BIDS use including demonstrating that the proposed use would not affect the ability of established lawful businesses, or potential future BIDS occupiers, to carry out their activities without constraints. 7.17 It is accepted that employees working in premises on designated Employment Areas need access to a range of small scale ‘ancillary services’. For the purposes of this policy, these are defined as small shops, food and drink establishments, gymnasia and crèches of less than 100m 2 .The absence of such facilities can increase travel demand and make areas less attractive to employers and staff. However, it is important that ‘ancillary services' are subordinate to, and do not form an integral part of, the main employment uses in the designated Employment Area. Furthermore, they must not undermine the availability or suitability of land for core uses or compete with operators of comparable main town centre uses in sequentially preferable locations. Where new employment areas are proposed, the need for 'ancillary services' should be considered as part of the overall development scheme. 7.18 As ‘ancillary services’ fall within the definition of main town centre uses, they would normally be directed to Bracknell Town Centre and other centres in the first instance. Due to their role in complementing the main employment uses in the designated Employment Area, the sequential approach will not be applied to applications for ‘ancillary services’. 137 KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (Chapter 6 Building a strong, competitive economy) PPG (Housing and economic needs assessment) Employment Land Needs Study (April 2020) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. 138 7.2 Employment development outside designated Employment Areas in defined settlements 7.19 Other employment sites exist outside designated Employment Areas in defined settlements, including in town centres, and are valued for the job opportunities that they provide. Sites in other uses may also come forward for employment development. 139 7.20 The Council is committed to supporting economic growth in the Borough and sustainable communities. To enable growth, it is important to ensure that existing businesses are able to adapt and expand and help new businesses as long as there are no significant environmental or amenity problems that cannot be overcome. In some cases, the size, location and characteristics of a site may mean that more intensive, mixed use development could provide greater benefit to the community in terms of addressing local needs, rather than if the site was retained solely in employment use. 140 7.21 The policy aims to support and enable such development and to direct it to suitable locations. The sequential approach referred to in point 2 (i) above means that Bracknell Town Centre, district centres, local centres and the designated Employment Areas will be the first preference for office developments before alternative locations are considered acceptable. 7.22 Development in the Countryside or Green Belt will be expected to accord with Policy LP 35 'Development in the countryside' or Policy LP 34 'Green Belt'.

If these figures are adapted to the plan period, there is a need for a further 19,125 m 2 of office floorspace and 48,875 m 2 of industrial and storage/warehousing floorspace from 2020/21. This takes account of the current planned supply (commitments and vacant floorspace) compared with gross need. 7.24 The study was published just before the COVID-19 pandemic which may have resulted in a change in the working patterns of many people. The extent to which these changes might become permanent is not yet clear. It appears that some employers are likely to make more agile working practices permanent. For some there may still be a need to spend time in an office for social interaction, and the generation of ideas and learning from colleagues. Although space generally represents a relatively small proportion of overall costs, occupiers are likely to be reviewing their space needs particularly in light of the financial difficulties and uncertainties businesses face around COVID-19 and BREXIT. Some are likely to conclude that they do not need the amount or type of floorspace which they currently occupy. The focus of the Government’s economic and fiscal strategy is on ensuring that it continues to support workers and businesses as the UK recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst it would be premature to quantify the impact on future need, this highlights the need for flexibility to enable businesses to adapt to meeting changing market conditions and achieve innovations. 43 https://consult.bracknell - [forest.gov.uk/file/5643472](https://consult.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/file/5643472) 142 Policy LP 20 Sites allocated for employment development/mixed use The following sites, as shown on the Policies Map, are allocated for employment/mixed use development and should be developed in accordance with the relevant strategic policies within this plan together with general policy considerations.

The floorspace allocated for these sites is for offices 7.25 The sites allocated in the policy above are key to implementing the strategy of further developing employment and economic opportunities in and around Bracknell Town Centre. 7.26 Bracknell Town Centre and its adjacent area is an important employment and commercial centre and the most accessible location in the Borough, offering the widest range of services and facilities. For these reasons, further employment and economic growth is also directed to central sites which will help support the continuing regeneration and ongoing viability of the centre. This accords with the Bracknell Town Centre Vision 2032 in which the Council confirms its commitment to the further regeneration of the area.This also reflects the strategy of focusing a significant proportion of residential development on this area and encouraging it to become an activity-based community gathering place. These schemes are planned to include offices to help meet the need for flexible small to medium sized units in a town centre environment. This will provide opportunities for occupiers of sites in designated Employment Areas to re-locate 143 and for those sites to be redeveloped and intensified for other employment uses if the market indicates a need. Active uses, such as retail, cafés and restaurants will be encouraged on the ground floor of appropriate buildings in Bracknell Town Centre. 7.27 The Peel Centre and The Point are located on the periphery of Bracknell Town Centre and together comprise a previously developed site in a highly sustainable location. The majority of the site currently comprises retail warehousing, and there is also a supermarket, restaurants and leisure facilities. The regeneration of Bracknell Town Centre, particularly the opening of The Lexicon, together with the difficult retail market has resulted in some duplication of tenants. The design of the units is dated and does not meet the needs of increasingly discerning occupiers and consumers. A mixed-use redevelopment of the site is therefore proposed through Policy LP 8 'The Peel Centre and The Point, Skimped Hill Lane, Bracknell (BRA18)', which includes 500m 2 office floorspace. 7.28 Therefore whilst provision in Policy LP 20 'Sites allocated for employment development/mixed use ' does not meet the overall theoretical need for the individual BIDS components there is significant uncertainty around future demand for floorspace and it provides a supply which could be drawn upon for a number of years into the plan period. The Council will continue to be supportive of suitable proposals for employment uses in appropriate locations in accordance with Policy LP 18 'Definition and protection of designated Employment Areas', Policy LP 19 'Employment development outside designated Employment Areas in defined settlements' and Policy LP 42 'Smaller businesses'. Take up needs to be carefully monitored to identify any emerging trends which will be responded to through a Local Plan Review. KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (paragraphs 20, 81-83) PPG (Housing and Economic Needs Assessment) Berkshire Functional Economic Market Area Study (February 2016) Employment Land Needs Study (April 2020) Western Berkshire Retail and Commercial Leisure Assessment (April 2017) Town Centre Retail Needs Technical Review (October 2020) Bracknell Town Centre Vision 2032 DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. 144 7.4 Hierarchy of centres Retail Development 7.29 The Western Berkshire Retail and Commercial Leisure Assessment (2017) [(44)] originally set out the need for comparison and convenience floorspace for the period 2016 to 2036. Although the study had regard to planned future development, The Lexicon was not open when the assessment was completed. At the time, it was assumed that Bracknell’s attractiveness as a comparison goods shopping destination would increase as a consequence of the opening of The Lexicon and that therefore Bracknell’s ‘market share’ would increase generating a greater ‘need’ for new comparison goods floorspace in Bracknell. 7.30 The Lexicon opened in September 2017 and Bracknell Town Centre rose in the retail rankings (Trevor Wood Associates) to 29 th in 2019 and 25 th in 2022 (from 255 th before the redevelopment). Further improvements are continuing through the implementation of a scheme based on the former Bentall’s store which will provide new retail, food, drink and leisure facilities. 7.31 A review [(45)] of the Western Berkshire Retail and Commercial Leisure Assessment concluded that a much lower proportion of the Lexicon has been delivered as comparison goods floorspace than expected, so the uplift in the comparison goods market share predicted may have overstated the need for comparison floorspace set out in the original report. Special Forms of Trading (i.e. online) have been revised upwards significantly, (irrespective of the impact of COVID-19) and retailer efficiency growth assumptions (i.e. assuming that retailers use their space more efficiently every year) have increased. Whilst it is recognised that Bracknell has experienced a step change in its role as a centre, the combination of factors outlined means that there is unlikely to be a need for new retail floorspace. Although the impact of the pandemic on the High Street is as yet unknown, it is likely that it will have exacerbated the position in terms of a decrease in footfall, and closure of stores. 7.32 For town centres to remain viable they must offer experiences that cannot be matched by online shopping. This means that they need to be given scope to diversify and evolve. The Council will therefore encourage proposals for complementary town centre uses of an appropriate scale to support the role of town centres as social spaces, increase customer dwell time, and make them more interesting places to visit. This requires a flexible planning approach that encourages investment, not just through economic policies but also by ensuring that local infrastructure and the Borough’s environment are of a high quality. 7.33 Changes in planning legislation allow greater flexibility of use through the introduction of Use Class E which incorporates former use classes A1-3 (shops, financial services and restaurants) and Class B1 (business – primarily office space), as well as parts of Classes D1 (non-residential institutions) and D2 (assembly and leisure). 7.34 The Council wishes to support businesses involved in economic sectors with potential to grow by assisting in the provision of new and refurbished floorspace designed to meet future needs. It is hoped that this will encourage growth in jobs and opportunities, together with the ability for people to live and work locally, reducing out commuting. 44 https://consult.bracknell - [forest.gov.uk/file/4621392](https://consult.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/file/4621392) 45 https://consult.bracknell - [forest.gov.uk/file/5755785](https://consult.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/file/5755785) 145 Shopping hierarchy 7.35 Bracknell Forest has a well-established network of centres, ranging in size and function from local centres meeting day-to-day retail needs to larger district and primary town centres that provide a broader range of goods and services and serve a wider area. 7.36 Bracknell Town Centre is the main shopping destination for residents in the Borough and plays a very important role in creating a sense of place and identity for the Borough. It provides the main focus for retailing in the Borough, and is also a focus for leisure and business activity in a highly accessible location at the centre of the local public transport network. The Lexicon has created a new social and cultural heart for the town, bringing a high-quality mix of shopping, leisure and vibrant public spaces to the Town Centre. As mentioned above, the regeneration is continuing with the development of The Deck, based around the former Bentalls store in the High Street and work on developing Princess Square. 7.37 The District Centres of Crowthorne and Sandhurst are vibrant centres with a focus on smaller retail units, restaurants and coffee shops. They provide a varied retail and leisure range that helps meet local convenience and day-to-day shopping needs. Their comparison goods offer is limited and therefore they serve a more local catchment. 7.38 The Borough’s local centres play an essential role in serving the everyday retail needs of the local community, providing such uses as convenience stores and pharmacies. Particularly important to residents with limited mobility, they reduce the need to travel by car to shop and are important in creating a sense of community and identity. Such is their importance in creating sustainable communities, local centres will continue to be provided as part of new residential development. 7.39 All the identified centres perform an important function for their local communities, and in some cases for wider communities. The purpose of this policy is to define the hierarchy and extent of the Borough’s centres to ensure that development proposals are consistent with their role and function. 7.40 Given the number of district and local centres in the Borough, serving areas that do not necessarily identify as ‘towns’; for the purposes of this plan, the term ‘centres’ replaces the NPPF term ‘town centre'. 146 7.41 There are a number of retail facilities that, whilst planned for, have not yet been delivered and therefore have not been included in the policy. Any new retail facilities (such as those within new strategic housing developments) should be considered in the context of this hierarchy and Policy LP 23 'Development of main town centre uses outside of designated centres' which sets out how they will be assessed. 46 Inset maps show the extent of centres in Appendix 3: 'Inset maps of Defined Centres' .These include Primary Shopping Areas. 147 7.42 The planned new local centres are: Land at TRL, Crowthorne Amen Corner South, Binfield Priory Field, Warfield KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (Paragraphs 86, 92, 93 and 106) PPG (Town Centre and retail - Paragraphs 001 Reference ID: 2b-001-20190722 to 008 Reference ID 2b-008-20190722) Western Berkshire Retail and Commercial Leisure Assessment (April 2017) Town Centre Retail Needs Technical Review (October 2020) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. 148 7.5 Development in Bracknell Town Centre 7.43 Bracknell Town Centre lies at the heart of Bracknell Forest and is the Borough’s main centre for retail, leisure, civic and cultural activities. It also acts as a transport hub serving the outer areas of Bracknell, the smaller settlements within the Borough and destinations further afield. The rail station and bus terminals, along with the large taxi rank at the southern end of the Town Centre provide a multi-modal transport interchange. The town’s retail and leisure offer has been significantly enhanced as a result of the opening of The Lexicon in 2017. Evidence on footfall and other indicators gathered prior to the pandemic, showed that the development had significantly increased the attractiveness of the centre. The broader range of town centre uses created means local residents no longer need to travel outside the Borough to access a choice of shopping, eating and entertainment opportunities. A number of residential developments have also been completed which add vibrancy and offer the opportunity for urban living. 7.44 Regeneration is continuing with the refurbishment of Princess Square and the area around the old Bentalls store, called The Deck. The Council is keen to promote and support other opportunities for development that have the potential to add to vitality and viability. Positive planning is required to attract a range of main town centre uses, including offices, leisure and cultural uses that support the day-time and evening economy, as well as further residential development and a mix of appropriate supporting facilities and services. 149 7.45 Bracknell Town Centre will act as the primary town centre for the Borough, and the focus for new development to support the continued regeneration of the Town Centre and enable it to thrive as a destination for retail, leisure and cultural activities. The hierarchy and extent of centres established in Policy LP 21 'Hierarchy and extent of centres' designates Bracknell Town Centre as the main shopping destination for residents in the Borough. 7.46 Further sites are already coming forward for development and are allocated in this plan for a mix of uses.These include the Eastern Gateway and the Southern Gateway Development Areas. The development of these sites will build on recent improvements to the range of uses, connectivity and quality of the environment and expand the community of residents, workers and visitors. 7.47 There is a need for a strong policy to facilitate and encourage the regeneration of further parts of Bracknell Town Centre. It is likely that the confidence already demonstrated by investors will lead to other sites coming forward during the plan period. The policy encourages a diverse range of uses whilst continuing to emphasise the importance of a strong retail heart based on the primary shopping area, which will add to the vibrancy of the area during the day and evening. 150 7.48 New development should contribute to the range of acceptable uses including: retail, (convenience and comparison); residential; employment (e.g. offices); recreational and leisure (e.g. restaurants, bars, bowling alleys, cinemas, open space, gyms etc.); civic (Town and Borough Council offices); cultural (e.g. churches, galleries, libraries); and, health facilities (including social care services). 7.49 There is a need to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is provided in a timely manner to support the operation and function of the area. This includes necessary transport, services and facilities. With an increasing residential population, the area is beginning to become a neighbourhood in its own right. However, rapid growth, combined with a significant proportion of the residential development coming forward through the Prior Approval process means that it has not benefited from the same range of supporting facilities that accompany some purpose-built neighbourhoods. New development must therefore be supported by other complementary uses such as leisure and community facilities that also play an active role in contributing to the functionality of the Town Centre. 7.50 Green spaces and vegetation including street trees are important in Bracknell Town Centre providing a wide range of environmental and quality of life benefits for those who live, work and visit the area. They also reflect the 'green' character of the Borough and enhance the settings of buildings. The Council will seek to ensure that developments include green features and link and enhance the existing network of green spaces. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 30 'Green infrastructure'. 7.51 Bracknell Town Centre is accessible by roads, pedestrian footpaths and cycleways from all directions. However, potential exists to make further improvements on the fringes to improve connectivity with the surrounding neighbourhoods and reduce the focus on the car. This should be a consideration in the determination of planning applications and it is important that the policy is read in conjunction with Policy LP 26 'Transport infrastructure provision'. 7.52 The Town Centre acts as a transport hub serving the outer areas of Bracknell and smaller settlements within the Borough and destinations further afield. The rail station and bus terminals, along with the large taxi rank at the southern end of the Town Centre provide a multi-modal transport interchange. Whilst Policy LP 5 'Sites allocated for residential/mixed use development' and Policy LP 20 'Sites allocated for employment development/mixed use ' allocate the bus station (as part of the Southern Gateway) for residential and economic/ mixed use development, it is a requirement of the policies that the bus interchange function is replaced either on-site or at another location in proximity to the rail station and the Town Centre in order to continue the provision of a multi-modal public transport hub. 151 KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (paragraphs 86 and 87) PPG (Town centres and retail) Bracknell Town Centre Vision 2032 DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. 152 7.6 Development of main town centre uses outside of designated centres 7.53 Bracknell Forest has an established hierarchy of town and other centres set out in Policy LP 21 'Hierarchy and extent of centres', with Bracknell Town Centre being the primary centre. This is because it is the most sustainable location in the Borough for retail and other main town centre uses. While Bracknell Town Centre serves as the main retail, leisure and transport hub for the Borough, the other centres also have important roles in serving their local communities’ day to day needs. It is important that the Borough’s centres remain competitive and that policies support their viability and vitality. 7.54 The transformation of Bracknell Town Centre into a legible and vibrant place for people to visit, live and enjoy is a critical element in the strategic planning of the Borough. New housing and other developments around the Borough have been allocated and designed with the intention of supporting its role. It is therefore important that this is not compromised by new development outside Bracknell Town Centre that could have a significant adverse impact on existing and planned investment, its attractiveness and its vitality and viability. The ability of other centres in the hierarchy of centres identified under Policy LP 21 'Hierarchy and extent of centres' to continue to meet day to day shopping needs should also not be compromised by development which would lead to a significant adverse impact when considered against the criteria in Policy LP 23 'Development of main town centre uses outside of designated centres'. 153 47 Ancillary Services are defined in paragraph 7.17 154 7.55 In order to promote the vitality and viability of centres, the NPPF sets out a 'centres first' policy, through a sequential test that directs main town centre uses to existing centres. This is supported by an impact test for retail and leisure developments which requires development that might harm a centre to be assessed against a range of factors. These are set out in the NPPF as follows: i. The impact of the proposal on existing, committed and planned investment (both public and private) in the centre or designated centres within the catchment of the proposal ii. The impact of the proposals on centre vitality and viability, including consumer choice and trade iii. Where the proposal is likely to have a significant adverse impact on one or more of the factors in i and ii above, it should be refused. 7.56 The established hierarchy of centres in Bracknell Forest (Policy LP 21 'Hierarchy and extent of centres') serves a valuable local and Borough-wide function. It is an important part of the Council’s strategy that Bracknell Town Centre should continue to act as a primary location for main town centre uses as it is the Borough’s most accessible and sustainable location. The designated district and local centres in the Borough act as focal points for communities and help meet everyday needs. They are fairly robust having reasonably high levels of occupancy and few long-term vacant premises. However, many have a limited offer and could suffer significantly from the loss of relatively few existing uses. Such centres might be vulnerable, particularly to impacts from new retail or leisure proposals within their catchments of a significantly smaller scale than the NPPF default threshold for requiring an impact assessment of 2,500m 2 . They have the potential to cause harm either individually or cumulatively, by diverting trade away from the centres. Many of these local centres individually contain a 2 combined floorspace of less than, or little more than 1,000m . 7.57 Any impact assessments for retail or leisure proposals located outside of defined centres will need to ensure that the proposed developments do not undermine or frustrate further regeneration opportunities in Bracknell Town Centre or prejudice the vitality and viability of centres, including local consumer choice and trade. Some of the larger new planned developments will have their own neighbourhood centres/shopping parades. In accordance with Policy LP 21 'Hierarchy and extent of centres' these should be reflective of their role and function in the hierarchy of centres. It is important that these are designed to serve the day to day needs of local residents and do not have any significant adverse impacts on existing centres. 155 7.58 It is clear that within Bracknell Forest, schemes of less than 2,500m 2 (the NPPF default threshold for assessing impact), have the potential to cause harm either individually or cumulatively, by diverting trade away from centres. The Plan sets a locally specific floorspace threshold of 1,000m 2 (gross external floorspace) or more outside Bracknell Town Centre and 500m 2 or more of gross external floorspace outside designated district and local centres above which an impact assessment will be required to accompany retail and leisure proposals. This reflects the modest size of centres across the Borough. If a proposed development outside a centre is unlikely to have an adverse impact, such developments should also be accessible to the community by foot, car, public transport and cycling. In addition, sufficient car parking should be provided on site and developments should not add significantly to traffic generation on the surrounding roads. Sites proposed for such development should not be required for other uses . 7.59 The purpose of assessing proposals outside centres involving retail and/or leisure uses is to ensure that they do not have significant adverse impacts over time (up to 5 years [or 10 for major schemes]) on existing centres. It is important that the impact is assessed in relation to all centres that may be affected, which are not necessarily just those closest to the proposal and may be in neighbouring local authority areas. 7.60 Where an impact test is required the following steps should be taken in accordance with the PPG: establish the state of existing centres and the nature of current shopping patterns (base year); determine the appropriate time frame for assessing impact, focusing on impact in the first five years, as this is when most of the impact will occur; examine the ‘no development’ scenario (which should not necessarily be based on the assumption that all centres are likely to benefit from expenditure growth in convenience and comparison goods and reflect both changes in the market or role of centres, as well as changes in the environment such as new infrastructure); assess the proposal’s turnover and trade draw (drawing on information from comparable schemes, the operator’s benchmark turnover of convenience and comparison goods, and carefully considering likely catchments and trade draw); consider a range of plausible scenarios in assessing the impact of the proposal on existing centres and facilities (which may require breaking the study area down into a series of zones to gain a finer-grain analysis of anticipated impact); set out the likely impact of that proposal clearly, along with any associated assumptions or reasoning, including in respect of quantitative and qualitative issues; any conclusions should be proportionate: for example, it may be sufficient to give a broad indication of the proportion of the proposal’s trade draw likely to be derived from different centres and facilities in the catchment area and the likely consequences to the viability and vitality of existing centres. 156 7.61 A judgement as to whether the likely adverse impacts are significant will be reached in light of local circumstances. Where this requires the impact assessment to be reviewed by an independent specialist as part of the planning application process, this will be paid for by the applicant.

To mitigate the impacts of new development and create sustainable developments and communities, new and improved infrastructure will be required at the right time and in the right place. The Council and developers will therefore liaise with relevant infrastructure service providers at appropriate points in the development process. 8.2 Infrastructure covers a broad spectrum of items and facilities. There are three main elements of infrastructure: Physical infrastructure including transport, waste and recycling facilities, built sports facilities, sports pitches, water supply and wastewater (including treatment plants), telecommunications infrastructure including full fibre broadband, electricity and gas networks. Social infrastructure including education, community facilities, healthcare, emergency services, public transport and libraries. It can also include affordable housing. Green infrastructure including SuDS, parks, playing fields, allotments, amenity areas, verges, biodiversity features, woodlands, hedgerows, water features such as lakes and rivers (also referred to as ‘blue infrastructure’) and other open spaces. It also covers SANGs and SAMM (see Policy LP 30 'Green infrastructure'). 158 8.1 Securing local infrastructure and facilities 8.3 Various mechanisms are used to secure infrastructure which include: Conditions attached to a planning permission which may, for example, require the provision of on-site infrastructure to be agreed, provided and maintained such as a private (unadopted) road. Legal obligations to secure on-site infrastructure (such as a new school or open space) and financial contributions towards off-site infrastructure (such as community facilities) which are usually set out in the terms of the section 106 agreement. Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) which is a charge on development based on a set of rates per square metre for relevant developments. CIL is usually spent on larger more strategic pieces of infrastructure such as secondary schools. Council funded new or improved infrastructure such as the Coral Reef Watersplash Centre. Privately funded infrastructure such as that provided by utility companies, for example, a new water supply pipeline to a development. Companies fund their own improvements in accordance with their strategic upgrade plans. Grants from a variety of sources, such as Government (for school improvements) and Local Enterprise Partnerships (for important road junction improvements). 8.4 Failure to provide the required infrastructure to ensure sustainable development and communities would have a detrimental impact on local amenity and the quality of the Borough’s built and natural environment. Key issues to be addressed through the Local Plan are the co-ordination of new development with required infrastructure and the need to take into account the capacity of existing infrastructure. 8.5 One of the main challenges in the delivery of sustainable development will be the funding of necessary supporting infrastructure. Delivery of new or improved infrastructure depends upon securing necessary contributions through the development process. Additional resources and support from both the public and private sectors are necessary. The Government also has a role in providing appropriate revenue support to those agencies that manage, maintain or provide infrastructure to create sustainable development. 159 160 8.6 The Council will work with infrastructure providers, stakeholders, partners and neighbouring councils to ensure that new and existing infrastructure is provided, improved and maintained to support sustainable development proposals identified in the Local Plan, helping Bracknell Forest to grow sustainably. Development proposals and infrastructure provision will be coordinated to ensure that growth is supported by the timely and appropriate provision of infrastructure. Planning conditions, section 106 planning obligations and CIL income will be used to provide infrastructure to support new development. 8.7 The Council has consulted extensively with Thames Water during the production of the Local Plan and its accompanying IDP where it was identified that growth will require improvement to capacity at wastewater treatment plants. Additional capacity will be required at wastewater treatment works including Bracknell as a result of the proposals identified in this Local Plan. The Council will work with Thames Water and developers to secure the delivery of the necessary capacity, through its investment plans, in advance of planned development taking place. 8.8 In line with regulatory requirements, the Council produces an annual Infrastructure Funding Statement (IFS) which sets out its infrastructure priorities including mechanisms for securing them. Some projects may be funded by a combination of both CIL and section 106 contributions. 8.9 The Council’s IDP indicates the type, scale and timetable for the delivery of infrastructure to support the relevant objectives and policies of the Local Plan. It also identifies the main funding mechanisms and lead agencies responsible for infrastructure provision. Infrastructure requirements are also set out in relevant policies in the BFLP, SPDs, development briefs and masterplans associated with new major development proposals and allocated sites. In ensuring the timely delivery of infrastructure requirements, development proposals must demonstrate that full regard has been paid to the IDP and all other relevant infrastructure policies in the BFLP. Strategic and local infrastructure provision will be based on a whole life costs approach. The IDP identifies programmed infrastructure provision from both the public and private sectors, in addition to that delivered through the development process. It provides an overview of the Borough’s infrastructure requirements and deficits, identifies who is responsible for delivery of these and includes a broad indication of phasing, timescales, costs and funding mechanisms. Capacity in infrastructure and services and the performance of both will be monitored through regular engagement with internal and external infrastructure services providers operating in the Borough and the IDP background supporting information will be regularly updated. 8.10 The Council adopted its CIL [(48)] on 6th April 2015. CIL will be reviewed periodically. CIL receipts are to be spent in accordance with the infrastructure list in the Council’s annual Infrastructure Funding Statement (IFS). This levy supports sustainable development in the Borough by securing funding for infrastructure, facilities and services necessary to meet local plan objectives and comply with relevant policies. The Council will also seek to secure site specific or local infrastructure through section 106 planning obligations, in-kind provision or financial contributions. This accords with the Council’s Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document [(49)] . Some on-site infrastructure may also be secured through conditions attached to planning permissions. Further infrastructure may be required through other policies, such as Policy LP 30 'Green infrastructure' and Policy LP 32 'Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area'. 48 www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/planning - and - building - [control/planning/planning](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy/community-infrastructure-levy/about) - policy/community - infrastructure - levy/about 49 www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/planning - and - building - control/planning/planning - [policy/supplementary](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy/supplementary-planning-documents/planning-obligations-supplementary-planning-document) - planning - documents/planning - obligations - supplementary - planning - document 161 KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (paragraphs 7, 8, 16, 20, 22, 25, 26, 28, 34, 86, 96, 110 and 160) PPG (reference ID: 61-001, 61-002, 61-016, 61-034, 61-043, 61-045, 61-046 and 61-048) Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) CIL Regulations 2010 (as amended) Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document 2015 DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications Implementation of other relevant policies in the Local Plan The statutory functions of the Local Highways Authority Implementation of the Infrastructure Delivery Plan Programmes Section 38/278 Highway Legal Agreements CIL and / or other infrastructure funding mechanisms Section 106 Legal Agreements and planning conditions 162 8.2 Transport principles 8.11 Development in the Borough has a direct impact on transport infrastructure in the area such as roads, junctions, footpaths, cycleways and public transport. The current transport infrastructure is under pressure from a growing population, increased car ownership, new development in neighbouring authorities and traffic generated from further afield. The Council has a responsibility to ensure that the pressure on local transport infrastructure is carefully managed and planned for and that, where possible, adverse impacts are mitigated, including in relation to safety, design, the environment and existing infrastructure. The sustainability of future development will depend on the application of effective transport policies. 8.12 The following two policies and supporting Development Management transport policies (19 'Transport') will help to deliver a well-designed and sustainable transport system which enables reliable access to services and facilities, reduces the need to travel, enables a choice of transport modes, and mitigates the impacts of new development on the transport network. 8.13 The transport policies accord with the NPPF, PPG and policies in the Local Transport Plan 3, which also reflect the planning related statutory functions of the Local Highways Authority. They provide an integrated set of principles to guide decision making, and should be read and considered together with all the other policies in the Plan. 163 8.14 The Council recognises the need to accommodate the growing population in the Borough and aims to deliver an effective, efficient, well managed and sustainable transport system. New development can bring about positive changes to transport provision.Well designed and located development which provides a mix of new housing, schools, health facilities, retail and leisure facilities or employment can reduce the need to travel. However, new development can also add significant pressure to busy networks. There are often opportunities to minimise impacts but where severe impacts (particularly, but not solely, those relating to congestion and highway safety) cannot adequately be mitigated, proposals will be refused. Development will be expected to provide choice by making suitable provision for non-car modes of transport such as cycleways. It will also be expected to provide appropriate infrastructure and mitigate severe adverse impacts to ensure the Borough's transport system operates in a safe, efficient and convenient manner. Mitigation measures will be sought where they are relevant to, and commensurate with, the scale of development. Developers should not pay to mitigate impacts that do not arise from their development. 164 8.15 Bracknell Forest is situated between the M3 and M4 motorways with several strategic A-roads running through the Borough. As a result, the local road network experiences high traffic volumes and must be effectively managed to minimise congestion. The Council will safeguard routes and land required for infrastructure improvements and secure works to improve routes and junction capacities. 8.16 There are good rail links from the Borough to Reading, London Waterloo and the Blackwater Valley. However, these and other public transport networks may need further investment to provide an attractive alternative choice to the car. The train service between Bracknell and London is relatively slow considering the distance (32 miles). The Council will continue to lobby Network Rail and other stakeholders for faster journey times as well as improvements to journey experience in terms of better station facilities and greater Wi-Fi coverage. 8.17 The Borough benefits from an extensive range of cycle paths and pedestrian routes; the Council will ensure these are protected as part of its normal highway function, and that new developments will provide safe and convenient opportunities for walking, and cycling both within developments and to nearby schools, shops, employment, leisure and other facilities. Opportunities will also be sought to improve and provide new links between existing routes and give priority to cycle and pedestrian movement through good design.

Development proposals which have an adverse impact on the existing highway network will be required to provide adequate mitigation in the form of safe and convenient new roads or junction improvements. Where a development would result in an increase in travel, adequate provision should be made for all modes of travel. This may include the provision of 166 new footpaths and cycleways, layouts that can accommodate buses, the provision of public transport infrastructure such as new or repositioned bus stops or taxi ranks or the provision of, or improvements to, links to existing facilities. In some circumstances it may be appropriate to make financial contributions to reasonably related off-site provision, if it can be demonstrated that an acceptable and achievable solution can overcome the harm caused by the development. 8.20 This policy provides a list of criteria which may all or in part apply to development proposals which will have an adverse impact. However, it may be that some are not relevant to some applications, in which case they will not be a consideration. 8.21 New developments should be well connected to existing bus, rail, cycle, pedestrian and community transport networks and facilities. They should provide new or improved infrastructure as appropriate to help create sustainable development as required by the NPPF. 8.22 PRoW are defined routes over which the public have a right to pass and repass. The PRoW network provides a valuable asset for local communities and should always be protected and improved where possible. Where an opportunity arises, commitment will be sought to improve the quality of a PRoW through improved connectivity, green infrastructure projects and/or accessibility improvements. A priority will be to secure, through new development, improved access for all, including people with reduced mobility through better surfacing of routes and replacing stiles and other restricting features. Accessible options shall be encouraged such as openings of sufficient width and suitably designed gates and kissing gates. The creation of safe circular routes for horse riders and cyclists will be sought. 8.23 Improvements must not detract from the attractive character of PRoW. This is because changes such as lighting and formal surfacing can detract from a leisure route’s rural character and give it a more urban nature as an adopted public highway. 8.24 The Local Highway Authority will seek to adopt highways on residential developments of more than six dwellings or those which provide connections through the site which benefit general public use by improving connectivity and access.

It results in increasing hazards such as flooding, heatwaves, and drought. 9.2 In 2020 the Council published the Climate Change Strategy 2020-24 [(50)] which includes detailed action plans and measurable ambitious annual targets to ensure that the Council meets the government target of eradicating its net contribution to climate change by 2050. 9.3 The NPPF confirms that “The planning system should support the transition to a low carbon future in a changing climate,\" through various policy measures. 50 https://www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/council - and - democracy/strategies [-](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/strategies-plans-and-policies/climate-change/climate-change-councils-approach) plans - and - policies/climate - change/climate - change - councils - approach 168 9.4 This policy sets out the overall approach of policies directed at tackling climate change to make the Borough a more environmentally sustainable place and net-zero carbon by 2050, through reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing local resilience to the impacts of a changing climate through a sustainable approach to development. A number of the measures will also help promote a healthy and active community. 169 9.5 Climate change mitigation is about reducing emissions and to this end the Plan includes the following measures: Reducing the need to travel by locating development in the most sustainable locations where there are existing facilities and services or the opportunity to enhance infrastructure. Where travel is necessary, sustainable modes of transport are encouraged rather than use of private vehicles (Policy LP 25 'Transport principles', Policy LP 60 'Assessing transport impacts and requirements' and Policy LP 26 'Transport infrastructure provision').To support this Travel Plans (Policy LP 61 'Travel plans') and cycle parking and electric vehicle charging points are also required (Policy LP 62 'Parking'). These policies should also benefit peoples' health by encouraging participation in physical activity and promoting social interaction, in addition to reducing noise and air pollution (Policy LP 58 'Pollution and hazards'). Encouraging the construction of energy efficient buildings that result in the amount of energy used for heating and cooling being minimised, together with the demand for energy. Giving consideration to the use of water through the incorporation of appropriate water efficiency measures to help minimise the potential for drought (Policy LP 55 'Sustainable construction'). Securing appropriate recycling of materials where relevant. Supporting renewable and low carbon technologies and sustainable construction. Increasing the amount of energy from renewable and low carbon technologies will help to make sure the UK has a secure energy supply, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to slow down climate change and stimulate investment in new jobs and businesses. Promoting green and blue infrastructure (Policy LP 30 'Green infrastructure') to help provide urban cooling and shading, surface water management and absorb and store carbon.This is further supported by open space standards (Policy LP 46 'Standards for Open Space of Public Value'), provision of SANG (Policy LP 32 'Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area') and the protection of trees and hedgerows (Policy LP 54 'Protection and enhancement of trees and hedgerows'). The approach to be taken to development also aims to leave the natural environment in a measurably better state than it was in beforehand by creating or enhancing habitats through the process of development (Policy LP 53 'Biodiversity'). The Borough’s open spaces, sports/recreation facilities and green infrastructure also help local communities lead lifestyles with greater levels of physical activity, resulting in better physical and mental health and increased social interaction as well as reduced exposure to noise and air pollution. Considering the need to minimise and reduce pollution from artificial lighting, noise and vibration and the protection of air and water quality in assessing development proposals (Policy LP 58 'Pollution and hazards'). 9.6 Adapting to climate change is about being prepared for climate change.The Plan includes: Promoting reduced carbon design approaches to the design of developments by, for example, using landform, site layout, building orientation and landscaping to minimise heat loss in winter whilst maximising shade during the summer and using natural lighting and ventilation (Policy LP 28 'Design principles' and Policy LP 50 'Design'). Giving consideration to climate change when allocating development sites, through, for example, the consideration of expected increases in flood risk from a range of sources. As a result of climate change, flood events are likely to become more frequent and more severe, having an impact on local communities and the environment. It is important that development is safe and resilient and does not increase flooding elsewhere. Development can offer opportunities to reduce flood risk through natural flood management techniques 170 and the use of SuDS which also have the potential to provide a range of multi-functional benefits (Policy LP 33 'Flood risk' and Policy LP 57 'Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)'). 9.7 A combination of the policies outlined in this document and measures under the Building Regulations should ensure sustainable forms of development that minimise carbon emissions from development housing and associated transport provision. The criteria applicable in Part 1 of the policy will depend on the nature and scale of the proposal requiring planning permission. The relevant policies referred to above contain a range of trigger points. For the purposes of Part 2 of the policy, ‘relevant proposals’ are major development as defined in the NPPF [(51)] and is aimed at ensuring that a proactive approach is taken to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Such proposals will be expected to be supported by a Climate Change Assessment outlining which policies have been applied and how their requirements have been incorporated in a development proposal. KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (paragraphs 8c, 11a, 20d, 153-158) PPG (Climate Change (Reference ID: 6-001 to 6-012)) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. 51 NPPF Annex 2: Glossary 171 9.2 Design principles 9.8 The design of development has a significant influence over the identity, cohesion and function of places. The Council is committed to securing high quality, robust designs and placemaking, meeting the needs of the local community. New development proposals should create connected environments, enabling ease of movement on foot, cycle, public transport and emerging technologies, to aid the creation of healthy places and communities that people want to live and work in. In addition, new development should include measures which to help communities to minimise, mitigate and adapt to climate change. 9.9 This commitment is supported by national policy which attaches great importance to the design of the built environment. The NPPF states that good design is a key aspect of sustainable development and creates better places in which to live and work. It advises that local plans should include robust and comprehensive policies that specify the quality of development that will be expected for the area. This policy sets out the key strategic principles that the Council expects development proposals to follow to deliver high quality development in the Borough. 172 173 9.10 Good design can deliver positive social, economic and environmental effects.The design and function of buildings, the space around buildings and linking new development to existing facilities can help to improve local identity, social wellbeing and health outcomes. It can assist in creating a sense of social cohesion and can ease the impact of development on the environment. Character and design 9.11 Proposals should respond to the physical, visual and functional context within which a proposal is located, with an aim to always enhance and add quality to an area. Applicants should respond to the character and history of the area, assessing landscape, townscape, streetscenes, development grain and built forms. Proposals should reflect and wherever possible enhance the identity of the area and context, whilst allowing for innovative and forward thinking design. 9.12 The Borough is varied in terms of character, with rural villages in the north, the New Town heritage of Bracknell in the central area of the Borough, and the historic and vibrant communities of Crowthorne and Sandhurst to the south. The Character Area Assessments Supplementary Planning Document defines character in many parts of the Borough and sets out a clear framework for development proposals coming forward in these areas. In some parts of the Borough there is also an opportunity to create development with its own identity and attractiveness, particularly on the new strategic sites identified in this Plan. However, such development will continue to need to look to the landscape and visual context within which it is located. 9.13 Design and layouts should create functional, safe places, as well as attractive ones, that support the health and well being of future communities. Appropriate levels of private and public amenity space should be incorporated into developments. Public spaces should have 174 good natural surveillance from surrounding properties. Safety, security and measures to alleviate anti-social behaviour should be considered from the outset and designed into development proposals. Connectivity and ease of movement 9.14 A mix of uses is encouraged within developments, particularly on larger sites. This assists in creating walkable neighbourhoods, reducing the dependency on the car and creating more cohesive communities, with places where all generations can meet and socialise. 9.15 Safe and easy routes to walk and cycle to facilities and services should be readily accessible to residents, promoting and enabling healthier communities. Development proposals should integrate effectively with existing movement patterns, particularly pedestrian, cycle and public transport routes and the existing road network. Safe and secure pedestrian and cycle routes should be provided both within the site and linking into the wider network. A good level of natural surveillance will be sought to ensure routes feel safe and overlooked. Proposals should facilitate and encourage sustainable travel methods. 9.16 The policy seeks to ensure that the design and location of all new development makes it accessible to all members of the community, including older people, people with disabilities and parents with young children. The site should be designed to facilitate ease of movement, in an inclusive manner. Routes should be level or on a gentle gradient, surfaces should aid access and the needs of all should be designed into a site, its spaces, facilities, and buildings to create an inclusive environment for all. Natural environment 9.17 The natural environment creates a strong context and character to many parts of the Borough, both within developments, and as a backdrop. Much of the Borough was historically forest and this has led to areas with a very distinct green identity. Different parts of the Borough have different landscape characters, with a particularly strong contrast between the northern and southern areas. It is important to include landscaping that responds to, and enhances, the character of the area. Linking green spaces within the Borough is also a key objective to enhance biodiversity and create wildlife corridors. Larger spaces for structural planting often have a greater visual impact than many small areas of greenery. No single approach fits all; landscape assessments should inform what is appropriate and can be delivered to enhance a proposal and integrate it within its landscape. Climate change and environmental sustainability 9.18 SuDS and drainage solutions need to be considered at the outset when evaluating a site. It is vital that developers consider water movement and where water will drain at the earliest stage of site assessment.This should then inform site layouts, street design, landscaping strategies, biodiversity and the design of open spaces. 9.19 The layout and design of streets, the design and orientation of buildings and appropriate materials can all be used to alleviate some of the negative impacts of climate change. The use of height on a site needs careful consideration and placement. Landscaping and tree planting can also assist in providing shade in parts of a development, such as within streetscenes, parking areas and public and private amenity areas.

Comprehensive development 9.20 Developments should be planned comprehensively in an integrated manner. Some larger scale developments or complex sites can take a number of years to complete and delivery is likely to be phased. In order to ensure developments take place in a coherent and structured way, masterplans and design codes should be produced and agreed with the Council to establish an overall vision and strategy for a development as a whole. This should be completed in a timely manner, to be agreed with the Council. An agreed masterplan will be a material consideration in the determination of the relevant planning application. The masterplanning process should include engagement with local communities. Applicants should also note that the Council will expect developers of larger, complex or more sensitive sites in the Borough to participate in the assessment of their promoted site by a Design Review Panel. Please contact the Council for further details relating to the design review process. 9.21 Large developments include those named in Part 2 of the above policy.This requirement will also apply to windfall sites involving development with the potential to have a significant impact on an area, requiring new or amended street networks, new green spaces, schools, community facilities and other elements of infrastructure. Furthermore, proposals are likely to be considered large if they involve phased development or are of significant height or scale. Complex developments are those in multiple ownership, involving high densities or having more than one key issue where a masterplan approach is needed to ensure they are satisfactorily resolved. Sites that are sensitive include sites of historic interest or character, those that affect the setting of an historic building and those that are in or adjacent to a conservation area. Others could involve sites including sensitive habitats, those located within sensitive landscapes or sites where development has the potential to affect views to or from the Green Belt. Further information 9.22 This policy links to many other policies within this plan, which should be cross referenced at the outset of developing a proposal for a site. 9.23 Developers are expected to have regard to various national documents relating to high quality design, in addition to the Council’s SPDs. The “National Design Guide” 2019, produced by the MHCLG and Local Government, sets out how to achieve good design in the planning system. “Building for a Healthy Life\" 2020 [(54)] is a valuable tool to meeting the Council’s policy objectives and will be used to monitor how high quality design is being met in the Borough. Any emerging design advice and good practice to ensure that development schemes positively contribute to placemaking should also be referred to. 53 [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-design-guide) - design - guide 54 https://www.designforhomes.org/wp - [content/uploads/2020/11/BFL](https://www.designforhomes.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BFL-2020-Brochure.pdf) - 2020 - Brochure.pdf 176 KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (paragraphs 7-10 and 131-141) PPG (Design: process and tools) National Design Guide 2019 National Model Design Code 2021 Building for a Healthy Life 2020 The Council’s SPDs: Designing for Accessibility SPD (2008) Character Area Assessments SPD (2010) Streetscene SPD (2011) Design SPD (2017) Sport England - Active Design DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. 177 9.3 Conservation and enhancement of the historic environment 9.24 The historic environment is recognised as an irreplaceable and valued resource which contributes to the local character and distinctiveness of Bracknell Forest. Heritage assets such as historic parks and gardens, listed buildings, conservation areas and scheduled monuments can foster healthy lifestyles, community cohesion, provide a ‘sense of place’ and drive economic vitality. 9.25 The importance of Bracknell Forest’s historic environment is recognised in its diverse range of heritage assets which include: 267 Listed Buildings; 61 Locally Listed Buildings; 6 Conservation Areas (Winkfield Village;Warfield;Winkfield Row; Easthampstead; Church Street, Crowthorne; Binfield); 12 Scheduled Monuments; 6 Registered Historic Parks and Gardens (Windsor Great Park; Ascot Place; Newbold College; Broadmoor Hospital; South Hill Park; and Bagshot Park); and, 576 records entered in the Berkshire Historic Environment Record (HER) identifying archaeological sites and finds in Bracknell Forest. 55 Heritage Asset - a building, monument, site, place, area or landscape identified as having a degree of significance meriting considerations in planning decisions, because of its heritage interest. It includes designated heritage assets and assets identified by the local planning authority (including local listing). (Annex 2: Glossary, National Planning Policy Framework) 56 NPPF and successor documents 178 9.26 The Council is committed to working proactively and inclusively with stakeholders to identify opportunities to ensure the conservation and enhancement of the historic environment (including a review of existing conservation area boundaries to ensure their relevance and reliability). This will ensure that it can be enjoyed for its contribution to the quality of life of current and future generations. To this end, the Council will review existing conservation area boundaries to ensure their relevance and reliability, and consider the appropriateness of restrictions on permitted development rights through the use of Article 4 Directions in such areas. 9.27 The significance of heritage assets to future generations, may derive from their archaeological, architectural, artistic or historic interest and from the contribution made by their settings. Designated and non-designated heritage assets, including their settings will be conserved and opportunities will be sought to sustain and where appropriate enhance the significance of heritage assets. 9.28 Proposed developments affecting heritage assets or their settings will be assessed against Policy LP 29 'Conservation and enhancement of the historic environment', and any other relevant policies, in this plan and with reference to the NPPF. 9.29 It is important that the significance of the Borough’s heritage assets and their settings are understood by developers. Development proposals affecting the historic environment will be expected to be supported by a Heritage Statement.Whilst the detail provided by the Heritage Statement should be proportionate to the importance of the heritage assets, it must demonstrate a clear understanding of their significance, the contribution made by their settings and how their significance would be affected, as well as a clear explanation of how harm will be avoided. 9.30 Great weight will be given to the conservation of the Borough’s most valued historic buildings, archaeological remains, townscapes and historic landscapes (as identified in the East Berkshire Historic Landscape Characterisation June 2019 [(57)] ) and any other designated heritage assets. Opportunities to sustain and enhance their significance and better reveal the significance and legibility of assets will be sought wherever possible. Harm to the significance of designated heritage assets should require clear and convincing justification. 9.31 Proposals for works to listed buildings should conserve features of architectural or historic interest and their settings, where these contribute to their significance. Development which undermines the economic viability or significance of a listed building will be resisted.The use of appropriate materials, construction techniques and methods of repair will be a fundamental requirement of any development proposal. The evidential value of the historic fabric is an important part of a listed building’s significance. The reinstatement of original architectural features will be supported where it can be demonstrated that this is adequately historically documented and the work proposed will sustain the significance of the listed building. 9.32 The Council will seek to actively manage change within the Borough’s conservation areas so that their character and appearance is conserved and enhanced. Conservation area appraisals and management plans will be taken into consideration when determining planning applications affecting their significance. The Council will require new developments within conservation areas or their settings to be of high quality. Substantial harm to the significance of a conservation area will not be permitted unless there are substantial and quantifiable public 57 East Berkshire Historic Landscape Characterisation June 2019 - [East Berkshire Historic Landscape Characterisation (HLC):](https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/eastberks_hlc_2019/) [Introduction (archaeologydataservice.ac.uk)](https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/eastberks_hlc_2019/) 179 benefits that outweigh the harm. Less than substantial harm to the significance of a conservation area will be strongly resisted unless there is a clear and convincing public benefit from the proposed development. 9.33 Non-designated heritage assets are important in contributing to local distinctiveness and a sense of place which are important to local communities. This has been recognised by the adoption of a Local List of Buildings and Structures. However, not all non-designated assets are included on the local list and they may also be identified through the assessment of development proposals. The Council will seek to ensure that non-designated heritage assets are identified, retained and enhanced and any impacts on their significance is addressed in the process of determining planning applications. The degree of harm to, or loss of, non-designated heritage assets will be assessed and balanced against their significance, the positive contribution made by the development and the extent to which any harm can be avoided or justified. Heritage assets at risk 9.34 The Council will monitor designated heritage assets considered to be at risk through neglect or other threats, and proactively seek to engage owners in applying sustainable solutions. Unless a heritage asset at risk is judged to have been subject to deliberate neglect, the Council will consider positively proposals that help restore and maintain heritage assets 'at risk'. 9.35 Where necessary the Council will use its statutory powers to ensure that designated heritage assets are appropriately maintained or repaired.

Bracknell Forest contains many green infrastructure assets which contribute to its character and sense of identity and make an important contribution towards increasing biodiversity, helping to provide mitigation for climate change and improving health and well-being.These assets are partly a result of the design of the Bracknell New Town and planning policy standards for the provision of OSPV and partly due to the natural assets of international, national and local importance. The requirement for SANG that is used as mitigation for the Thames Basin Heaths SPA (see Policy LP 32 'Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area') that provides alternative open space has significantly added to these assets. 9.37 This policy seeks to protect and enhance green infrastructure by maximising opportunities that arise through development. The Council has an existing suite of strategies; and has undertaken a Green Infrastructure Review [(58)] to identify existing assets, deficits and opportunities. The Council will continue to work to develop an overarching Green Infrastructure Strategy to pull this work together and focus on measures to protect and enhance the Green Infrastructure network. 58 CLP/EV/9a at https://consult.bracknell - [forest.gov.uk/file/4706561](https://consult.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/file/4706561) 181 182 9.38 Green infrastructure is not simply an alternative description for conventional open space. As a network it includes both public and private greenspace, deliberate and incidental areas such as parks, open spaces, playing fields, woodlands, street trees, allotments, private gardens, green roofs and walls. It also includes blue infrastructure such as rivers, lakes, streams, SuDS and other water bodies and features. 9.39 Green Infrastructure can serve the following functions: i. access and recreation; ii. ecological networks of wildlife corridors and stepping stones for biodiversity; iii. connecting urban and rural areas; iv. landscape and visual amenity benefits; v. providing cooling and shading in urban areas; vi. surface water retention and management; vii. absorbing and storing carbon, providing mitigation for climate change; viii. food production; and, ix. water and flood management. 9.40 It can contribute to human well-being by: i. providing accessible green spaces for exercise, recreation and play; ii. creating opportunities for community cohesion through allotments, community gardens and community orchards; and, iii. providing accessible walking, riding and cycling routes to link communities with both urban and rural areas. 9.41 Green infrastructure assets include: i. parks and gardens - urban parks, country parks, formal gardens; ii. amenity greenspace - informal recreation spaces, outdoor sports facilities, domestic gardens, village greens, commons, other incidental space, green roofs and walls; iii. natural and semi-natural green space – SANGs, woodland and scrub, grassland, heath, wetlands, open and running water, unmanaged land and disturbed ground; iv. blue infrastructure – watercourses, flood zones, ponds and sustainable urban drainage systems; v. allotments, churchyards and cemeteries; vi. other green features – hedgerows, verges, individual trees or tree groups; and, vii. corridors – paths, cycle ways, riparian land, ditches, verges, lines of trees, hedgerows and linear green spaces. 9.42 Further details of the types and functions of green infrastructure assets can be found in the Council’s Green Infrastructure Review. 9.43 Through the enhancement of existing green infrastructure assets, and the creation of new green infrastructure assets, opportunities will be sought to benefit from the functions of green infrastructure as set out above. For every proposal it will need to be decided how to prioritise between functions. 183 9.44 Through Policy LP 53 'Biodiversity' measures that enhance, mitigate and compensate biodiversity can also provide an opportunity for green infrastructure and improve habitat connectivity. Watercourses are identified as an important local resource for supporting biodiversity within that policy. In order to support this biodiversity function, development should be set at least 8 metres back from the banks of main rivers and ordinary watercourses and should be maintained as a natural or semi-natural habitat, free from built development, parking areas, private gardens and formal landscaping. Where a main river or ordinary watercourse runs through a proposed development, a minimum 8 metre buffer shall be provided on both banks leading to a minimum 16 metre wide undeveloped area in total. A long term landscape and ecological management plan will be required for this buffer zone. The rapid expansion of Bracknell New Town resulted in the culverting of a significant length of watercourse which it is desirable to de-culvert when opportunities arise. New culverting will be resisted except where the developer can demonstrate that there are no other practical means of access including through the use of clear span bridges. All these measures bring many other benefits such as providing informal access for enjoyment of the water, enhancing the landscape, minimising flood risk, reducing the levels of diffuse pollution reaching the watercourse from land-based activities and providing access for river maintenance. 9.45 The Bracknell Forest Green Infrastructure Review identified that Bracknell Forest has few formal green spaces (parks and gardens), but has significant amenity green space. It has significant natural assets, including blue infrastructure; woodlands that are moderately well connected, and grasslands and heathlands that are more fragmented. There is good access to open space, especially some large areas, but it is not well connected. Productive land is dominated by forestry; there is little agriculture, and community opportunities for growing food (orchards, allotments) are few in most parishes (Bracknell being the exception). Water and flood management can be a significant issue. There are opportunities for addressing gaps in provision and connectivity both in enhancing existing assets and in new provision as part of developments. It identified the priorities for green infrastructure in Bracknell Forest focusing on improving connectivity for wildlife and people, water and flood management and opportunities for community food production. 9.46 The Council is updating its Green Infrastructure Strategy which will help to inform delivery of this policy. Additional work will include a statement of priorities for protecting key areas of the network and addressing deficiencies in green infrastructure. It will outline how the Council will work with partners to plan, protect, promote, enhance and extend the network and to embrace opportunities provided by development. 9.47 Green infrastructure has a strong relationship with other policies in this Plan including Policy LP 32 'Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area', Policy LP 33 'Flood risk', Policy LP 28 'Design principles', Policy LP 45 'Play, open space and sports provision', Policy LP 46 'Standards for Open Space of Public Value', Policy LP 50 'Design', Policy LP 53 'Biodiversity', Policy LP 31 'Designated nature conservation and geological sites', Policy LP 57 'Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)' and Policy LP 26 'Transport infrastructure provision'. 9.48 The Council will use its planning powers and responsibilities as a landowner to work with local communities and other partners, including those preparing Neighbourhood Plans and in adjoining local authorities, to identify and implement opportunities to improve the quality of the green infrastructure and to protect the existing green infrastructure assets from harmful development. 184 9.49 The provision of green infrastructure should be built into proposals at an early stage of the design process, particularly on larger sites where proposals should demonstrate how Green Infrastructure assets are to be incorporated.

Over 20% of the Borough is protected by designations, including two habitats sites comprising parts of the Thames Basin Heaths SPA and Windsor Forest and Great Park SAC, nine Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and Local Nature Reserves (LNR), Local Wildlife Sites (LWS) and Local Geological Sites (LGS). 9.53 Designated sites are shown on the Policies Map although their boundaries may change over the course of the Local Plan period. When implementing any policy relating to designated nature conservation and geological sites the most up to date boundaries will be used. 9.54 There is a range of legislation protecting ecological resources in the UK. This includes the Natural Environment and Rural Communities ( NERC ) Act 2006 and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The Thames Basin Heaths SPA and Windsor Forest and Great Park SAC are given the highest level of protection through the Habitats Regulations. Nationally designated SSSIs have national statutory protection and will be conserved and enhanced. 9.55 National policy identifies that distinctions should be made between the hierarchy of international, national and locally designated sites, so that protection is commensurate with their status and gives appropriate weight to their importance and the contribution that they make to wider ecological networks. 9.56 The Council recognises that locally designated sites are areas of substantive nature conservation value and should be identified, safeguarded, managed and enhanced.They make an important contribution to ecological networks and nature’s recovery. They can also provide wider benefits including public access (where agreed), climate mitigation and helping to tackle air pollution. 9.57 Applications for development will be subject to a Habitats Regulations Assessment where they are likely to have a significant adverse impact on the integrity of habitats sites and reference should be made to the BFLP Habitats Regulations Assessment. Guidance for the assessment of air pollution effects on habitats sites has been agreed with Natural England and is available on the Council's website. Natural England has advised that the thresholds for windfall developments that require an air quality assessment are developments with a net increase of over 100 dwellings and other developments on a case by case basis which are not included in the BFLP Air Quality Assessment (March 2021). Should this advice change, the Council will update the guidance accordingly. Applications for development which is likely to have an adverse effect on SSSIs (either individually or in combination with other development) should include an assessment of these potential adverse effects; the Council will develop guidelines for such assessments if appropriate and in consultation with Natural England. 9.58 Developers will be required to submit monitoring data to the Council to show the effectiveness of any planning obligations and conditions. 9.59 This policy has a strong relationship with other policies in this Plan including Policy LP 3 'Sustainable development principles', Policy LP 32 'Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area' and Policy LP 54 'Protection and enhancement of trees and hedgerows'. 187 KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (paras 8, 20 and Chapter 15) PPG (Natural Environment) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. Use of planning conditions and obligations. 188 9.6 Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area 9.60 The TBH SPA is a network of heathland sites that provides a habitat for important ground nesting bird species. Two of these heathland sites are in Bracknell Forest. The TBH SPA was designated in March 2005 and is protected by UK legislation. The SPA affects eleven local authorities across Hampshire, Berkshire and Surrey. 9.61 The integrity of the SPA has the potential to be adversely affected by new development, such as through urbanisation, recreational activity and air pollution. Unless there are 'Imperative Reasons of Overriding Public Interest', to comply with the law, it must be certain that the harm is avoided and mitigated. 9.62 The SPA within Bracknell Forest covers over 1,300 hectares and includes Broadmoor to Bagshot Heaths Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) (the area surrounding the Look Out Discovery Centre) and the Sandhurst to Owlsmoor Bogs and Heaths SSSI (also known as Wildmoor Heath). 189 190 9.63 The TBH SPA is designated under European directive 2009/147/EC because of its populations of three heathland species of birds – Dartford Warbler, Nightjar and Woodlark. This Directive has been transposed into UK law by the Habitats Regulations. 9.64 Natural England has identified that net additional housing up to 5 kilometres from the SPA boundary is likely to have a significant effect (alone or in combination with other plans or projects) on the integrity of the SPA. Some development between 5 and 7 kilometres from the SPA boundary may also have an impact on the integrity of the SPA. The evidence available indicates that effective mitigation measures should comprise a combination of providing suitable areas for recreational use by residents to divert them from the SPA and actions on the SPA to manage access and encourage use of alternative sites. Should other evidence become available, further avoidance and mitigation measures may be required and will be set out in supporting guidance. 9.65 The Council will support small developments wherever possible by providing strategic SANG capacity. Priority for the allocation of strategic SANG capacity will be given to small developments within the defined settlement. These are developments which in the Council’s view are not sub-divisions of a larger site in order to meet the threshold for strategic SANGs. Other small development sites in areas outside of the defined settlement may need to provide, or contribute towards, a bespoke or third party SANG solution. 191 9.66 Large developments may be expected to provide their own SANGs although the Council may provide SANG capacity for large town centre sites if capacity is available. Where the Council is unable to provide SANG capacity, the option remains for large developments to provide an off-site SANG or purchase SANG capacity from third party providers if available and within the catchment of the development. Where a large allocation requiring a bespoke SANG has been subdivided into smaller sites for development, developers will be encouraged to work with one another to secure a bespoke SANG solution. Where this is not possible the option remains for these sites to provide an off-site SANG or purchase SANG capacity from third party providers. The release of council-owned strategic SANG for such developments, or for developments permitted under Prior Approval arrangements could jeopardise the SANG capacity required for planned development on allocated sites. This would put them at risk of not being able to meet the Habitats Regulations and gain planning permission. The Council therefore reserves the right not to provide available SANG capacity if the proposal is considered to undermine the Council’s SPA avoidance and mitigation strategy and/or the delivery of allocated development sites. 9.67 Applications for development will be subject to a Habitats Regulations Assessment where they are likely to have a significant adverse impact on the integrity of the TBH SPA and reference should be made to the BFLP Habitats Regulations Assessment. Where an air quality assessment is required, guidance for the assessment of air pollution effects on habitats sites has been agreed with Natural England and is available on the Council's website. Natural England has advised that the thresholds for windfall developments that require an air quality assessment are developments with a net increase of over 100 dwellings and other developments on a case by case basis which are not included in the Bracknell Forest Local Plan Air Quality Assessment (March 2021). Should this advice change, the Council will update the guidance accordingly. 9.68 Detailed guidance about SANG and the SAMM project is provided in the Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area Supplementary Planning Document which will be updated periodically as necessary. This guidance sets out: Zones of influence Strategic SANG provided in the Borough Financial contributions for strategic SANG including how they are calculated on a per bedroom basis Standards and requirements for providing bespoke SANGs Details of the SAMM Project including the financial contributions on a per bedroom basis. 9.69 The Council will work positively with applicants to bring forward third party SANG and with other local authorities to implement mitigation measures. This may include assistance to those Authorities with insufficient SANG land within their own boundaries. 9.70 This policy has a strong relationship with other policies in this Plan including: Policy LP 30 'Green infrastructure'. 192 KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (paras 20, 174, 175, and 179-182) PPG (ID references: 8-007, 8-008, 8-011, 8-017, 8-018 and 8-020) BFLP Habitats Regulations Assessment Thames Basin Heaths Delivery Framework (2009) Thames Basin Heaths Joint Strategic Partnership Board Thames Basin Heath Special Protection Area Supplementary Planning Document (2018) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications.

One of the major impacts of a changing climate is an increased risk of flooding. Flood risk is a combination of the probability and potential consequences of flooding from all sources. These sources include rivers, seas, rainfall, rising groundwater, sewers and drainage systems that exceed capacity, reservoirs, canals and lakes. New development should be planned to avoid increased vulnerability to the range of impacts arising from climate change. Inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding should be avoided by directing development away from areas at highest risk, and where development is necessary, making it safe without increasing flood risk elsewhere. Application of the sequential test, sequential approach and the exception test, as required by the NPPF, achieve these objectives. 194 9.72 Bracknell Forest Level 1 (2018) and Level 2 (2019) Strategic Flood Risk Assessments (SFRAs) [(60)] have been prepared to inform this policy and the allocations included within the Local Plan. All development proposals should comply with the recommendations in the SFRAs. 59 NPPF or successor documents 60 https://www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/planning - and - building - [control/planning/planning](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy/development-plan/draft-bracknell-forest-local-plan/evidence-base) - policy/development - plan/draft - bracknell - forest - local - plan/evidence - base 195 9.73 The SFRAs have considered all sources of flooding including fluvial, surface water, groundwater, sewers and reservoirs, both now and in the future, taking climate change into account. They have identified Flood Zone 3a, with an allowance for climate change, and Flood Zone 3b (functional floodplain). Fluvial flooding is not generally a significant issue as the majority of the Borough is within Flood Zone 1 (low risk of flooding). The most significant sources of flooding in the Borough are surface water and groundwater; and the Council will require these sources of flooding to be fully addressed in the sequential test, sequential approach and site specific flood risk assessments. For example, by protecting overland flow routes and appropriate use of SuDS as a means of addressing surface water, supported by investigation and groundwater monitoring. 9.74 Information on flood risk is being updated continuously and flood risk identified in the SFRAs may change.The most up to date flood risk information should always be used, including the SFRAs and the Flood Zones identified by the Environment Agency Flood Map for Planning. Sequential test, exception test, and sequential approach 9.75 The aim of the sequential test is to direct new development to areas at the lowest risk of flooding from all sources, both now and in the future, to ensure that areas with little or no risk of flooding are developed in preference to areas at higher risk. Development should not be permitted if there are reasonably available sites in areas with a lower risk of flooding. The sequential test is required in accordance with national policy. 9.76 If it is not possible for development to be located in areas at lower risk of flooding, the exception test may need to be applied. The need for the exception test will depend on the vulnerability of the proposed development and the Flood Zone as set out in the NPPF 'flood risk vulnerability classification' and the PPG 'flood risk vulnerability and flood zone incompatibility' table. 9.77 The exception test requirements as set out in the 'flood risk vulnerability and flood zone incompatibility' table in the PPG are only concerned with coastal and fluvial flooding. In the context of Bracknell Forest, it is important that the risks from other sources, such as surface water, are addressed.The Environment Agency has advised that in locations within Flood Zone 1, where the exception test is not required, but there is a risk from other sources of flooding, it must be shown that development will be safe for its lifetime and the risk can be managed through a sequential approach to design. 9.78 A sequential approach to the layout of a development site can reduce the risk of flooding through avoiding areas at risk of flooding from all sources and not increase flood risk overall, both off and on site.This approach also ensures that the most vulnerable development is located in the areas at the lowest risk of flooding. Although the first preference is to avoid flood risk, where this is not possible, flood resistance and resilience measures can be incorporated into the design of buildings and infrastructure. Design can be addressed in site-specific FRA and the Council’s Design Supplementary Planning Document (2017) [(61)] provides further information. 9.79 The SFRAs provide the necessary information for the sequential and exception tests to be applied. Early discussions with the Environment Agency and the Council are encouraged, at the pre-application stage, for sites within flood risk areas, to address flooding issues. 61 https://www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/planning - and - building - [control/planning/planning](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy/supplementary-planning-documents) - policy/supplementary - planning - documents 196 Flood Risk Assessment 9.80 A site-specific FRA will be required for any development located within areas identified as being at risk of flooding identified in the SFRAs as well as in locations prescribed by national policy (including Flood Zones 2 and 3). Where the latest Cumulative Flood Risk Assessment identifies high or medium cumulative flood risk, reference should be made to the relevant considerations in the FRA. Information on flood risk is being updated continuously and flood zones identified in the SFRAs may change and the most up to date flood zones should always be used (for fluvial flood zones see the Environment Agency Flood Map for Planning). 9.81 This policy has a strong relationship with Policy LP 27 'Climate change' and Policy LP 30 'Green infrastructure'.

The Green Belt also provides opportunities for people to access the countryside (within the Green Belt), to protect land for agriculture, forestry and similar land uses, and for nature conservation. Approximately 3,843 Ha (just over 35%) of Bracknell Forest lies within the Green Belt. National policy sets out that whilst most forms of development are inappropriate in the Green Belt there are some exceptions. These include development such as new buildings for agriculture and forestry, and the limited infilling or redevelopment of PDL, where it would not have a greater impact on the openness of the Green Belt. The following Policy sets out the approach to development in the Green Belt in Bracknell Forest. Where development relates to rural workers dwellings and equestrian uses, this policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 47 'Dwellings for rural workers' and Policy LP 49 'Equestrian uses'. 9.83 The NPPF (paragraph 138) defines the purposes of the Green Belt as: to check the unrestricted sprawl of large built-up areas; to prevent neighbouring towns merging into one another; to assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment; to preserve the setting and special character of historic towns; and, to assist in urban regeneration, by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban land. 62 In relation to para. 149e of the NPPF, or any successor document 198 9.84 Another key aspect of the Green Belt is keeping land permanently open. Therefore, impact upon openness will be an important consideration in the determination of all relevant proposals in the Green Belt. Openness can have both spatial and visual impacts. In the case of new buildings, it will be relevant to also consider the volume of proposals, as one indicator of impact. 9.85 Inappropriate development will not be approved unless very special circumstances can be clearly demonstrated. Replacement buildings 9.86 Replacement buildings are expected to be sited on or close to the position of the original building, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that an alternative position would reduce the overall impact on the openness of the Green Belt. 9.87 When considering proposals for replacement buildings, the starting point will be the size of the existing building. When assessing whether a replacement building is materially larger than the one it replaces, the Council will compare the size of the existing building with that proposed, taking account of siting, floorspace, bulk and height, together with the effect of the proposals on the openness and character of the area. 9.88 As a general guide, a replacement building that would result in an increase in the volume of the existing building by more than 20% is very likely to be regarded as materially larger. The Council will calculate volume as a measurement of external structure, inclusive of roof voids, and basement areas. 9.89 The floorspace of existing outbuildings will not normally be taken as counting towards the floorspace of the existing building to be replaced, unless the outbuilding(s) is closely related to the existing building (for example, is of substantial construction, within the curtilage of (and within 5m of), and ancillary to the main use of the building), and it has not been previously taken into account as part of any replacements of the building itself, or other buildings on site. Where a proposal seeks to include floorspace/volume of outbuilding(s), and this is deemed acceptable, the Council will consider the removal of permitted development rights for future outbuildings. The inclusion of a basement to increase floorspace does not preclude it from being taken into account when considering whether a replacement building is ‘materially larger’ than the original. Re-use or conversion of buildings 9.90 The re-use of buildings provides opportunities for the diversification of the rural economy and contributes to the economic growth of the area. It can also contribute towards the reduction in demand for new buildings in the Green Belt and can be a means of conserving traditional buildings which are a distinctive feature within the Borough’s rural landscape. 9.91 Where a proposal relates to the re-use of an agricultural building, it must not result in the need to construct additional agricultural buildings, unless it can be demonstrated that the building to be re-used is no longer suitable/needed for an agricultural use. In April 2015, the Government updated permitted development rights allowing the change of use of agricultural buildings to other uses, subject to certain limitations and conditions. Therefore, this policy will only apply where permitted development rights (including any future amendments) cannot be exercised. 199 9.92 Where buildings are to be converted, they should be of a permanent and substantial construction, as demonstrated by a structural survey, and be capable of re-use without major alterations, adaptations or reconstruction (insofar as said works fall beyond reasonable repair that would not require the submission of a planning application). 9.93 Buildings can often be converted without causing material harm to the open character of the Green Belt. However, the Council recognises that particular uses or levels of use can either directly or indirectly have an adverse effect. For example, whilst the re-use of a vacant building for residential accommodation in itself may be acceptable, some associated features such as fences and walls, driveways, domestic paraphernalia and ancillary buildings could harm the open character of the area. The creation of new residential curtilages around newly converted buildings can adversely affect the undeveloped, rural character of an area, having an urbanising effect. Any new curtilage, and associated boundary treatment, should be proportionate to the size of the building, and be in keeping with the surrounding rural character, and not cause substantial harm to the openness of the Green Belt. Enhancements to the immediate area (for example landscaping) will therefore be sought, and removal of permitted development rights considered. 9.94 The Council will take into account the likely cumulative impact of a proposal, including having regard to its visual impact on the surroundings and highway safety. The effect of these and similar features will be assessed when dealing with re-use applications. Villages in the Green Belt (for the purposes of infilling) 9.95 A study of Green Belt Villages was undertaken to determine the extent and location of ‘villages’ within the Green Belt, based on certain criteria (Green Belt Village Assessment, BFC, February 2018 [(63)] ). The term ‘village’ is not defined in national policy. For Bracknell Forest, to qualify as a ‘village’ a form of community facility needs to be available (such as a church, community hall, or school). Consideration is also given to the level of other facilities available (such as provision of a local shop/post office, public house, restaurant or obvious village centre/recreation area); and whether areas provide a village function (if walkable) to other nearby areas. Areas which comprised solely housing were not considered to meet the definition of a ‘village’. 63 Green Belt Village Assessment. LP/Ev/5d: consult.bracknell - [forest.gov.uk/file/4860644](https://consult.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/file/4860644) 200 9.96 An overview of the rationale for defining areas as ‘villages’ is set out in the table below: Table 15 Rationale for defining Green Belt villages (for the purpose of infilling) |'Village' name|Reason defined as a 'village'| ||| |Cranbourne|Linear development of housing. Contains a school, restaurant and recreation ground, with bus route. Village is walkable (along pavement) to North Street – together the two provide village facilities.| |North Street, Cranbourne|Linear development of housing. Contains a local convenience store, public house, bus route and several smaller businesses. Village is walkable (along pavement) to Cranbourne, Lovel Road – together the two provide village facilities.| |Church Road, Winkfield|Linear development of housing. Contains a church, village hall, and public house, and bus route. Village is walkable (along pavement) to Maiden’s Green, together the two provide village facilities.| |Maidens Green/Winkfield Street|Linear development of housing. Contains a public house and bus route. Village is walkable (along pavement) to Church Road which contains a church and village hall – together the two provide village facilities.| |Cheapside|This forms part of a wider village, the majority of which lies within the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead. Within the wider village area there is a village hall, school and recreation ground. There are also a limited number of small business premises which provide village facilities.| 9.97 As set out above, and in Policy LP 34 'Green Belt' some village areas have been defined on the Policies Map, for the purposes of allowing limited infilling (in line with paragraph 149(e) of the NPPF).This reflects the need to protect the openness of the Green Belt. For the purposes of this policy, limited infilling is considered to be the development of a small gap in an otherwise continuous built-up frontage, or the small-scale redevelopment of existing properties within such a frontage. The infill plot should be comparable in size and shape to those developed plots which adjoin the site and must have an existing frontage to a suitable road. The proposal should be appropriate to the scale of the locality and not have an adverse impact on the character and openness of the Green Belt, or the local environment. 201 Extensions and alterations 9.98 The extension or alteration of buildings in the Green Belt is not considered to constitute inappropriate development, provided that it does not result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original building, and is therefore by definition, harmful to the openness of the Green Belt. 9.99 The starting point for consideration of proposals for extensions to existing buildings in the Green Belt will be the siting, floorspace, bulk and height of the 'original' building. This means the building that existed on 1 July 1948 or, if constructed after 1 July 1948, as it was originally built. Any extensions and outbuildings built subsequently will not be considered part of the original building. 9.100 The floorspace of outbuildings will not normally be taken as counting towards the floor space of the ‘original building’ unless the following applies. Where an outbuilding(s) is of substantial construction, within the curtilage of (and within 5m of), and ancillary to the main use of the building, and there is clear evidence it was built concurrently with the building being extended/altered (such as a dwelling with a detached garage), it will be considered to comprise part of the ‘original building’. Where a proposal seeks to include floorspace/volume of outbuilding(s), and this is deemed acceptable, the Council will normally remove permitted development rights for future outbuildings. 9.101 When assessing whether a proposed extension represents a disproportionate addition, the Council will compare the size of the ‘original’ building with the proposed extension, taking account of siting, floorspace, bulk and height, together with the effect of the proposals on the openness and character of the area. The floorspace of basements included in any proposal will be taken into account when considering whether an extension or alteration is a disproportionate addition. 9.102 As a general guide, an extension that would result individually, or cumulatively with other extensions, in an increase in the volume of the original building of more than 40% is very likely to be regarded as disproportionate. The Council will calculate volume as a measurement of external structure, inclusive of roof voids, and basement areas. 9.103 New outbuildings within the curtilage of a residential property will be regarded as inappropriate development, being by definition, harmful (as they are not listed as an exception within national policy). Changes of use of land 9.104 Changes of use of land are not considered to be inappropriate development, provided they preserve the openness and do not conflict with the purposes of the Green Belt. In assessing proposals; regard will be had to whether they have a greater impact than existing uses on the open, rural and undeveloped character of the Green Belt and whether they detract from the purposes of including land in it. This will include any associated boundary treatment. Enhancements to the immediate area (for example landscaping) will therefore be sought, and removal of permitted development rights considered. 202 Previously developed land 9.105 Limited infilling, or partial or complete development of PDL is not considered to be inappropriate development, provided that it does not have a greater impact upon openness compared to existing development. In assessing impact, consideration will be given to any change in scale of development, spread of development within the site, and the siting, floorspace, bulk and height of buildings. 9.106 Proposals for infilling will need to relate to the present activity on the site, and should comprise development within small gaps in otherwise built up areas. Any replacement buildings should be sited on or close to the position of the original buildings, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that an alternative position would reduce the overall impact on the openness of the Green Belt. Enhancements to the immediate area (for example landscaping) will therefore be sought, and removal of permitted development rights considered. Jealott’s Hill 9.107 The Jealott’s Hill International Research Centre is a significant developed site within the Green Belt. It has been a location for agri-tech research for approximately 90 years, and is recognised as a globally important research and development centre for agricultural technology. The site is home to a highly specialist workforce and many specialised buildings and other facilities and makes an important contribution to high value employment and economic activity in the Borough. It also has important links to universities and commercial organisations across the UK. It is acknowledged that the nature of research in this sector is changing and the importance of collaboration within the Agri-tech sector and related emerging industries is increasing. In light of these needs, and the varying ages of the site’s existing buildings, the Council recognises that the site will need to accommodate change through new development in line with national Green Belt policy.

A priority for the Council is to maintain the distinction between built-up areas and the countryside by controlling the spread of development outside defined settlements. The settlement boundaries have been reviewed and redefined to ensure that they are, or will be, strong and defensible. 9.109 This plan allocates sufficient land to meet future development needs and therefore land outside the defined settlements should be protected. Through its assessment of land to allocate, the Council has concluded that the areas outside of defined settlements are generally in unsustainable locations, poorly related to facilities required on a day to day basis. 9.110 This policy sets out the types of development that are appropriate within the countryside, which for the purpose of this policy is defined as areas outside of defined settlements, and outside of the Green Belt. It ensures that the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside is protected, whilst supporting the rural economy. A separate policy relates to the Green Belt (Policy LP 34 'Green Belt'). This policy should be read alongside Policy LP 36 'Landscape character (outside of defined settlements) '). For consideration of proposals relating to rural workers dwellings and equestrian uses see Policy LP 47 'Dwellings for rural workers' and Policy LP 49 'Equestrian uses'. 204 205 9.111 Countryside locations within Bracknell Forest remain close to urban areas. Therefore development proposals which do not fall within the categories listed within the policy, will require justification as to why they cannot be located within a defined settlement. In assessing proposals, consideration will also be given to relevant design/character policies (Policy LP 28 'Design principles', Policy LP 50 'Design', and Policy LP 36 'Landscape character (outside of defined settlements) ') and design guidance, in addition to the following matters: 206 Employment development 9.112 It is recognised that in some cases there will be a need to adapt existing employment sites to help support the rural economy including business and community needs within the countryside. However, not all sites are in sustainable locations in terms of access to services, and public transport. The Council will therefore support particular uses which need to be located in rural areas and are sustainably located, or have the ability for their location to be made more sustainable (for example through improving access by foot, cycle and public transport). 9.113 Any proposed development will need to minimise its impact upon the character and appearance of the area. The Council will require the need for proposals to be evidenced. They should be of an appropriate scale, design and materials having regard to the locality (for example location within the site, scale in relation to plot size, and scale in relation to any existing/nearby buildings). Residential development 9.114 Isolated new homes in the countryside will be resisted, and will only be permitted if there is demonstrable need, such as for essential rural workers to live permanently at or near their place of work (Policy LP 47 'Dwellings for rural workers'), or their design is of exceptional quality. Replacement dwellings and residential extensions will be supported in line with other aspects of this policy. Sport, recreation and nature conservation 9.115 Appropriate recreational uses in the countryside will be those which are essentially outdoor and respect and maintain the undeveloped rural character and appearance of the countryside. This would include uses such as golf courses. Buildings required to support the recreational use will normally be ancillary to the main outdoor recreational use and will be small in scale. Consideration will also be given to the impact of artificial lighting (such as floodlights), upon the character and appearance of the countryside. In assessing proposals, consideration will also be had to Policy LP 58 'Pollution and hazards'. Extensions, outbuildings and replacements of existing buildings 9.116 Proposals must be designed to minimise any harm to the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside. When considering proposals, the starting point will be a comparison of the size of the existing building with that proposed. In determining whether proposals are detrimental to the rural character and appearance of the countryside, the Council will take into account: the size of the plot; the character of the site and its surroundings; the siting within the plot; floorspace, volume and height; and, the design of the proposal. 207 Re-use or conversion of buildings 9.117 The re-use of buildings provides opportunities for the diversification of the rural economy and contributes to the economic growth of the area. It can also contribute towards the reduction in demand for new buildings in the countryside and can be a means of conserving traditional buildings which are a distinctive feature within the Borough’s rural landscape. Where a proposal relates to the re-use of an agricultural building, it must not result in the need to construct additional agricultural buildings, unless it can be demonstrated that the building to be re-used is no longer suitable or needed for an agricultural use. Where buildings are to be converted, they should be of a permanent and substantial construction, as demonstrated by a structural survey. They should also be capable of re-use without major alterations, adaptations or reconstruction (insofar as any proposed works fall beyond reasonable repair that would not require the submission of a planning application). 9.118 Whilst the re-use of a vacant building for residential accommodation may be acceptable, some associated features such as fences and walls, driveways, domestic paraphernalia and ancillary buildings could harm the character of the area. The creation of new residential curtilages around newly converted buildings can adversely affect the undeveloped, rural character of an area, having an urbanising effect. Any new curtilage, and associated boundary treatment, should be proportionate to the size of the building, and be in keeping with the surrounding rural character. Enhancements to the immediate area will therefore be sought (for example additional landscaping), and the removal of permitted development rights considered. 9.119 The Council will take into account the likely cumulative impact of a proposal, including having regard to its visual impact on the surroundings and highway safety. The effect of these and similar features will be assessed when dealing with re-use applications. 9.120 Minerals and waste development 9.121 Minerals and waste development proposals will be assessed against the minerals and waste policies within the Development Plan.

The Council is committed to ensuring that the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside, together with valued features of the landscape are protected and enhanced, whilst enabling the sustainable growth necessary for communities and the economy to thrive. The policy aims to protect and enhance the distinctive landscape character of land outside of defined settlements (both within and outside of the defined Green Belt), including the setting of settlements. It will need to be demonstrated how development proposals take into account and respond positively to the character of their surroundings. Particular regard must be had to the landscape's valued features and characteristics and to the landscape strategy for the local character area as set out in the Landscape Character Assessment (2015, or any subsequent document which supersedes this). 209 210 9.123 National planning policy recognises the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside (including the Green Belt). Bracknell Forest’s countryside provides an attractive landscape setting for the settlements and its links with ecological and green corridor networks in urban areas. National policy also refers to proposals contributing to the natural and local environment, being sympathetic to local character, including the surrounding landscape setting, and establishing and maintaining a strong sense of place. 9.124 Bracknell Forest’s landscapes are environmental assets which contribute to the Borough’s distinctive and varied landscape character. These landscapes have evolved to their present form over thousands of years from a combination of natural geomorphological changes and human influence. All landscapes are valued across Bracknell Forest for different reasons as set out in the Bracknell Forest Landscape Character Assessment (2015). 9.125 The Bracknell Forest Landscape Character Assessment identifies a number of landscape types which are informed by similar patterns of geology, topography, vegetation and human influences. These areas include: heathland (much of which forms part of the Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area), woodland (predominantly coniferous plantations), grasslands (more extensive in the north of the Borough where agriculture is more prevalent), and wetland habitats (including the main river corridors of The Cut and the River Blackwater). 9.126 Landscape character areas share generic characteristics with other areas of the same types, but are single unique discrete geographical areas of landscape type. The local landscape character areas are as set out in the Landscape Character Assessment (and are defined on the Policies Map and Inset Maps). 9.127 The Assessment describes the key characteristics that define these landscapes, identifies valued features and characteristics, forces for change (such as continued pressure for development) acting on the landscapes, and provides a landscape strategy for each landscape character area. 9.128 The Landscape Character Assessment will be used to assess the impact of relevant development proposals on the character of landscape, ensuring that landscape character and sensitivity are fully considered. Development proposals will need to demonstrate how they take into account and respond positively to: valued landscape features and characteristics, and the defined characteristics of the relevant landscape character area, and the landscape strategy for that landscape character area, and show how any adverse impacts will be mitigated. 9.129 Proposals should strengthen and enhance landscape character and local distinctiveness wherever possible. This includes demonstrating that the distinctive setting and character of individual settlements will be protected and retained. Safeguarding the landscape setting and character of settlements is important in order to maintain a sense of place for individual settlements, and conserve their existing character. Where appropriate, landscape enhancements will be sought. 211 9.130 This information could be included in a design and access statement, masterplan, landscape proposal or Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment (LVIA). It is important that valued features proposed for retention and areas for proposed enhancement and mitigation are clearly shown on a plan, so that the overall impact on the landscape character can be properly assessed. A proportionate approach will be taken depending on the qualities and impact on the affected landscape, and the nature of the proposed development.

In general, these are the policies that set criteria for considering and determining planning applications. Policies are both generic (covering criteria that can be applied to all developments), and topic based for particular issues that are specific to Bracknell Forest. They help deliver the 'Vision' and strategic objectives by promoting and enabling development that delivers the Spatial Strategy in Part 1 of the BFLP. 11.2 The development management policies have been prepared having regard to the NPPF, supplemented by the PPG. The Council is mindful of government guidance which makes it clear that development management policies should not just repeat what is already contained within national policy (and in some cases legislation). Consequently, there are no development management policies for certain topics as national policy will be relied on for decision making purposes. In terms of the process to be followed in determining planning applications, the presumption in favour of sustainable development is already set out in paragraph 11 of the NPPF and similarly, it is not considered necessary to repeat it in this document. Implementation, delivery and monitoring 11.3 The policies within this document must not be read in isolation. All relevant policies in Part 1 and Part 2 of the BFLP, together with policies in other adopted Development Plan documents including 'made' Neighbourhood Plans, will be taken into account in determining planning applications, along with other material considerations. While linked policy boxes are included to related strategic policies of direct relevance, they do not list or cross-reference all other policies that may be relevant. Proposals for new development will be judged against all relevant policies in the Development Plan. Applicants are encouraged to enter into pre-application discussions to help identify all key issues surrounding a development proposal and matters that should be the subject of infrastructure contributions and legal agreements. 11.4 The delivery of development management policies will in the main be through the grant or refusal of planning permission and any subsequent appeals. Monitoring allows the local planning authority to assess whether objectives are being achieved.The Monitoring Framework set out in Appendix 2: 'Monitoring Framework' gives details about the monitoring of policies. The results of each monitoring exercise are included in the annual Authority Monitoring Report (AMR). This will help determine whether a review of any policy is required. 214 12 Housing 12.1 Protection of existing housing stock 12.1 To ensure a sufficient supply and choice of housing, it is important that not only are additional new homes provided, but also that the existing housing stock, and land that is or was in residential use, is protected. This should ensure there is sufficient overall net gain of new homes to meet future needs. 12.2 This policy relates to residential units which fall within Use Class C3 dwelling houses and residential care homes and nursing homes within Class C2. 215 12.3 Policy LP 4 'Provision of housing' sets out the requirement for new homes to meet future housing needs in the Borough over the plan period. It is important to plan for the delivery of new homes to meet this need. The Council also needs to protect the existing housing stock, and land already used, or last in lawful use for, residential purposes including supporting proposals that bring empty homes into use. This will help ensure that the net increase in new homes is maximised and that future housing needs are met. 12.4 Any development proposal that leads to the net loss of residential accommodation whether through change of use or redevelopment will be resisted unless there are overriding public benefits that would justify the loss of the residential use. However, the Council recognises that there may be particular circumstances that justify the loss of residential uses and the circumstances where such a loss may be acceptable are set out in this policy. 12.5 The Council is supportive of bringing empty homes back into use subject to the lawfulness of accommodation and evidence that the residential use has not been abandoned. In the event that the accommodation is not lawful, its use for residential purposes will be addressed in the context of the prevailing policies of the plan relating to the assessment of a new dwelling. 12.6 In relation to specialist accommodation, it is acknowledged that in some cases, there may be a net loss of accommodation, even though specialist accommodation is being re-provided on-site. This may be due to a need to bring care accommodation in line with relevant standards in relation to access and internal space provision. Applications falling within this category should be accompanied by supporting information to justify any reduction in bedspaces/dwelling equivalent provision.

Bracknell Forest Empty Homes Scheme [(64)] 64 https://www.bracknell - [forest.gov.uk/housing/empty](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/housing/empty-homes) - homes 216 12.2 Accessible and adaptable dwellings 12.7 Accessible and adaptable dwellings have the potential to meet the needs of a wide range of social groups, including older people, some disabled people, and non-disabled people including families with children. They are important in helping to create strong, healthy and self-reliant communities. 12.8 Accessible and adaptable homes support the changing needs of residents from raising children through to mobility issues faced in old age or through disability. Such homes have design features that help mobility issues faced due to old age, injury, disability, pregnancy and the presence of young children requiring buggies or equipment. The objective of this policy is to secure the delivery of accessible and adaptable housing to meet the changing accommodation requirements of occupiers throughout their lifetime and in particular, the needs of older people 217 and people with disabilities. Accessible dwellings have the benefits of enabling independent living, personal health benefits, personal psychological benefits and social cost benefits. Homes such as these are also more suited to be visited by people with restricted mobility. 12.9 Part M of the Building Regulations relates to the Access and use of Buildings. Revisions to Part M of the Building Regulations in October 2015 introduced additional technical requirements for accessibility for dwellings (exceeding the minimum standards required by the Building Regulations) known as ‘optional standards’. The optional standards may be applied where a local planning authority has a policy in place, based on evidence, that a higher level of accessibility and adaptability in new residential development is viable and necessary to meet current and future housing needs. 12.10 Part M, Volume 1 Dwellings, sets out the following: Mandatory Building Regulations as set out in Regulation M4(1): Visitable Dwellings. This covers the physical security of dwellings and it requires that reasonable provision should be made for most people, including wheelchair users, to approach and enter the dwelling and to access habitable rooms and sanitary facilities on the entrance storey. 12.11 Optional Building Regulations are set out below: M4(2); Accessible and adaptable dwellings. This provides for dwellings to be capable of adaptation through time to meet the changing needs of occupiers. It requires that reasonable provision should be made to enable most people to access the dwelling. The dwelling should also incorporate features that make it potentially suitable to a wide range of occupants, including older people, those with reduced mobility and some wheelchair users. M4(3); Wheelchair user dwellings. This requires wheelchair users to be able to live in the dwelling and use any associated private outdoor space, parking and communal facilities that may be provided for the use of the occupants. 12.12 The Bracknell Forest Housing Needs Assessment (July 2020) [(65)] provides evidence of the need for accessible and adaptable housing in view of the projected change in the age profile of the Borough. It demonstrates that there will be a growth in the number of people aged over 65 and a corresponding increase in the number of people with a limiting long-term health problem or disability. The Housing Needs Assessment also concludes that the need for wheelchair user dwellings equates to about 5% of the total housing need after applying national data to the demographic projections. 12.13 Where the calculation of the 5% requirement of dwellings to be wheelchair adaptable would result in less than one home, provision of an on-site wheelchair adaptable property will be supported. 12.14 The evidence supports the delivery of both accessible and adaptable dwellings M4(2) and wheelchair users dwellings M4(3). 65 consult.bracknell - [forest.gov.uk/file/5819854](https://consult.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/file/5819854) 218 12.15 New housing development will be expected to comply with requirements of this policy unless it has been demonstrated that specific site factors such as the vulnerability to flooding, site topography or other site circumstances make the site less suitable for complying with the optional standards in M4(2) and M4(3). Compliance with the policy should be demonstrated in the Design and Access Statement submitted with the planning application. 12.16 This policy has a strong relationship with other policies in this Plan including Policy LP 40 'Housing mix', Policy LP 50 'Design' and Policy LP 39 'Specialist housing'. KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (para 62) Bracknell Forest Housing Needs Assessment (March 2021) PPG (Housing for older and disabled people – Accessible and adaptable housing ID: 63-008-20190626 to 63-009-20190626 ) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. 219 12.3 Specialist housing 12.17 This policy is not limited to specialist housing for older people but relates to specialist housing within Class C2 or C3 that is accommodation designed and designated for occupation by older people, disabled people, and/or vulnerable people with specific housing needs. This type of accommodation is referred to within the policy and hereafter as ‘specialist housing’. 220 12.18 People with the need for specialist housing contribute to the community in many ways, but for some their ability to participate fully in society is hampered by poor or inappropriate housing, which affects their physical or mental health, or their ability to receive the support they need to live as independently as possible. 12.19 Proposals need to be located within the defined settlement, on sites with good access to local facilities. While residents in care or nursing homes may be unlikely to leave the site unaccompanied, staff and visitors are likely to travel to and from such homes on a regular basis. It is therefore important that this form of accommodation is also located with easy access to services and facilities. Locating accommodation with support close to shops and services can also encourage residents to visit them, potentially with help from staff or visitors, thereby remaining more active. 12.20 Specialist housing also needs to be in locations where it can be integrated with the surrounding community, for example by design of shared space and provision of ancillary facilities that complement local provision. This will help achieve inclusive, mixed communities as will the avoidance of large concentrations of such accommodation across a small area. It is expected that specialist housing should incorporate safe and accessible high quality amenity space. It should also be of high quality design, and buildings will be expected to meet the provisions contained in Policy LP 38 'Accessible and adaptable dwellings'. 12.21 Specialist housing in C2 use will also be expected to be accompanied by information to demonstrate the level of on-site personal care and level of communal facilities to be provided, in order that a judgement can be made as to the nature of the specialist housing being proposed. Specialist housing for older people 12.22 The requirement for specialist housing for older people is set out in Policy LP 17 'Provision of specialist housing for older people'. This includes the integration of housing for older people at Policy LP 6 'Land at Beaufort Park, Nine Mile Ride, Bracknell (BRA4)', Policy LP 7 'Land east of Wokingham Road and south of Dukes Ride (Derby Field), Crowthorne (SAND5)' and Policy LP 8 'The Peel Centre and The Point, Skimped Hill Lane, Bracknell (BRA18)' to provide mixed, balanced communities. 12.23 Further specialist housing is expected to come forward through the implementation of windfall permissions. KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (paragraph 62) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. 221 12.4 Housing mix 12.24 In addition to ensuring a supply of housing land, it is also necessary to ensure that the right mix, type and size of housing is delivered. Different households require different forms, types and sizes of housing. It is important that an appropriate choice and mix of housing is provided across the Borough in order to enable people to move through the market from one type of house to another and create balanced and sustainable communities. 222 12.25 The NPPF requires local planning authorities to identify the range, size, and type of housing needed. The Bracknell Forest Housing Needs Assessment (2020) [(66)] includes an analysis of the current housing stock within the Borough and expected demographic trends. It therefore provides the baseline evidence to assist in determining the housing mix required across the plan period. The study recognises that the ‘market’ is to some degree a better judge of what is the most appropriate profile of homes to deliver at any point in time, and demand can change over time linked to macro-economic factors and local supply. 12.26 Proposals for specialist accommodation should provide a mix of units that respond to the identified needs for the particular section of the community that they seek to accommodate. They will not be expected to provide a balanced and proportionate mix of dwelling types and sizes that is applicable to accommodating the identified local needs for general needs housing of the wider population. Proposals should, however, still contribute to re-balancing the wider housing market and the provision of a balanced housing mix as part of any of the larger developments. 12.27 The results of monitoring and data from other local sources of information should also be used to help respond to housing needs. Policy LP 16 'Affordable housing' deals with affordable housing and refers to the need for the affordable housing mix to reflect the type and size of market housing to be provided on the site. Applicants are required to provide sufficient evidence to support their proposals. 12.28 Whilst the housing mix should be informed by this evidence, it will also need to respond to the character of the site and its setting.The Spatial Strategy focuses a significant proportion of planned new housing on sites in and around Bracknell Town Centre. This is where there are a number of previously developed sites and the location is highly accessible and close to services and facilities. In view of this and the need to make efficient use of land, higher densities are sought on these sites which is likely to mean that smaller units will be delivered. It will therefore be particularly important to seek larger family homes (including larger affordable dwellings) on the sites outside this area to help to meet the needs for families. 12.29 This policy has a strong relationship with other policies in the Plan including Policy LP 16 'Affordable housing', Policy LP 38 'Accessible and adaptable dwellings' and Policy LP 50 'Design'. 66 https://consult.bracknell - [forest.gov.uk/file/5819854](https://consult.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/file/5819854) 223 KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (para 62) PPG (ID67-001-20190722) Bracknell Forest Housing Needs Assessment (July 2020) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. 224 12.5 Gypsies, travellers and travelling showpeople 12.30 The Government’s Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (PPTS) states that local authorities should provide a basis against which planning applications for traveller development proposals will be determined. 225 12.31 Development proposals will be considered against the policy considerations set out above and the plan as a whole. They will only be permitted where provision is for those who are recognised as gypsies, travellers or travelling showpeople, and the location and design of the site satisfies the policy tests. Acceptable proposals will require a condition or legal agreement limiting the use and occupation of the site to gypsies, travellers or travelling showpeople as appropriate. 67 as defined in Annex 1 of the PPTS (December 2023) 226 12.32 When considering the impact on local amenity and the natural environment, consideration should be given to both existing local residents and future occupiers of the site, including the potential for noise and air pollution, traffic movements and other activities likely to be taking place both within and around the site. 12.33 The layout of the site should be designed to a high standard to result in good quality living conditions for those on the site, including space for a static caravan/ mobile home and touring caravan, adequate parking, storage, waste collection and other associated on site facilities such as hardstandings, space for large vehicle turning, amenity blocks, amenity space and boundary treatments. Proposals should be sympathetic to, and in-keeping with, the surrounding area to encourage community cohesion. The design and layout of the site should take account of caravan site licensing requirements. Where proposals are for transit provision for short term accommodation, pitches are likely to be smaller and will not be required to accommodate a residential component such as a static caravan/ mobile home, but should be sufficient to accommodate two touring caravans, two parking spaces and private amenities for each pitch. 12.34 The PPTS states that inappropriate development is harmful to the Green Belt and should not be approved, except in very special circumstances. Traveller sites (temporary or permanent) in the Green Belt are inappropriate development. [(68)] The above policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 34 'Green Belt'. 12.35 Existing sites which have planning permission or lawful use for gypsy or traveller or travelling showpeople use, will be safeguarded from other types of development. This will ensure that there is no net loss of pitches or plots and that the permitted use as a gypsy, traveller or travelling showpeople site is not lost through the grant of any subsequent planning permission, or relaxation of planning conditions. This will include the loss of pitches or plots for permanent structures such as bricks and mortar accommodation. Proposals that involve the loss of these sites or pitches/ plots will only be permitted if a satisfactory replacement can be provided. The replacement will need to be provided prior to the loss of the existing pitch/ plot or site, and should meet the same policy criteria identified above relating to a new site. This is to ensure that these sites, and others that may be authorised, are retained to meet identified needs within the Borough. 12.36 The above policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 29 'Conservation and enhancement of the historic environment'. National policy sets out that development proposals should avoid or minimise harm to heritage assets (NPPF paragraph 195). 12.37 The above policy should also be read in conjunction with Policy LP 33 'Flood risk' and Policy LP 57 'Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)'. National policy is that sites for travelling populations should not be located in areas at high risk of flooding (including functional floodplains), given the particular vulnerability of caravans. New or extended traveller sites will not be supported in areas at high flood risk. 12.38 The above policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 58 'Pollution and hazards'. Water quality is a key consideration to prevent pollution of aquifers and water courses. Sites should be connected to foul sewers, or where this is not possible, waste should be disposed of without impacting on water quality (NPPF paragraph 174). 68 As per paragraph 16 of the PPTS (December 2023) 227 KEY EVIDENCE Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (PPTS) NPPF (paragraphs 8(c), 62, 126-136, 167, 168, 174 and 194-208) Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment (arc4, 2022) Designing Gypsy and Traveller Sites Good Practice Guide (2008) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. 228 13 Economic development 13.1 Smaller businesses 13.1 Small businesses and emerging economic sectors fulfil an important role in the Borough’s economy and can help achieve a sustainable approach to development by providing jobs across the Borough. The Council’s evidence base indicates a demand for small units, and data shows most businesses in the Borough are micro or small. Provision of small employment units in the Borough for smaller businesses is important. 229 13.2 Small business units have an important role in providing accommodation for a variety of small businesses and contributing to the strength and diversity of the local economy. They are particularly important in enabling small and medium sized enterprises to operate and expand. 69 For one year 70 Commercial terms that are construed by the Council as being reasonable, i.e. at a sound, realistic and viable price for the type of use. 230 13.3 Smaller units often come under pressure for redevelopment to higher value larger employment units or alternative uses, especially residential. It is important that they are encouraged and retained to support a diverse local economy. Smaller business units are 500m 2 or less GEA in size. When determining applications that involve the loss of smaller business units (500m 2 or less GEA), a range of evidence will be required as referred to in Part 2 of the policy above and as expanded below: Details of any existing or previous occupiers during the last five years including the nature of operations and reasons for vacating the premises. An explanation of any specific issues with the continued use of the site for employment which cannot be mitigated and mean that the facility cannot function properly. The availability of suitable alternative accommodation in the local area. Where an existing tenant is present whether or not relocation might impact on the operation and sustainability of the business. Evidence that the premises or site have been actively marketed for at least 12 consecutive months at a price commensurate with market values (based on evidence from recent and similar transactions and deals). It should also be demonstrated that the terms and conditions set out in the lease are reasonable and attractive to potential businesses and that no reasonable offer has been refused. Details of the condition of the site or building especially where it is argued that this renders it unsuitable for its present use. Economic viability and feasibility evidence should be submitted, including why it is not viable to re-use it for an alternative economic use.

Successful retailers have adapted to this new environment. For many, maintaining a store network where customers can browse and seek advice as well as collect goods bought online is part of their offer. Retail policy needs to be flexible and responsive enough to accommodate further changes in shopping trends, to ensure that centres remain active, vibrant and sustainable in the long term. 72 Appendix 3: 'Inset maps of Defined Centres' 73 Appendix 3: 'Inset maps of Defined Centres' 74 Terms that do not require abnormally high rent or an unusually short letting period, compared with similar units in the Borough, which could make the proposition unattractive to a prospective tenant. 233 13.8 In response to these challenges, changes to the Use Classes Order in 2020 allow far greater flexibility with the introduction of a broader Class E ‘Commercial, Business and Service’ Use Class. This allows typical high street uses to change between uses within Class E without the need for planning permission to better adapt to changing demand. 13.9 Primary shopping areas in Bracknell Forest’s centres will continue to focus on providing retail, with support from other Class E uses such as cafes and restaurants.This policy will help prevent the over-provision of non-Class E uses that could undermine the vitality and viability of centres. In the application of Part 2 of Policy LP 43 'Development proposals in centres', primary shopping areas include ground floor units only, with upper floor units excluded. 13.10 Outside the primary shopping areas but within the wider town and other centres, a variety of other main town centre uses will be encouraged, including more intensive sport and recreation uses, arts and cultural uses, and other footfall generating uses that add to the liveliness, attractiveness and economic resilience of the various centres. 13.11 The percentage criterion referred to in Part 2 of Policy LP 43 'Development proposals in centres' will be applied flexibly where: i. an acceptable change of use would result in the overall number of units in the primary shopping area only marginally exceeding the threshold for non-Class E use; and, ii. a proposal would not have an adverse impact on the vitality and viability of the centre. 13.12 This criterion will also apply to proposals in centres that already breach this threshold. 13.13 In order to avoid unnecessary delay in the determination of applications, applicants are recommended to submit a pre-application enquiry. This will enable the above factors to be assessed at the earliest opportunity and guidance provided as to the information required as part of a planning application. 13.14 The Council recognises the importance of maintaining the environmental quality of its shopping areas. The importance of offering a range of uses has to be balanced against the impact of development proposals on local amenity and public health. For example, the assessment of applications for proposals for change of use to hot food takeaways (Sui Generis) will consider any cumulative impact taking into account other existing takeaways and whether there are any sensitive uses in the local area such as a school or residential properties. 13.15 Residential development can benefit the vitality of town and other centres by creating activity outside business hours and providing better natural surveillance. Such development would normally be supported on upper floors above the primary shopping area provided that it would not lead to the creation of “dead frontages” within the primary shopping area which can fragment shop frontages. Residential proposals that reduce ground floor commercial space in centres are likely to undermine their core function and to harm their vitality and viability, and will not normally be permitted. 13.16 New centres needed to meet the needs of new communities will be required and should be of an appropriate scale and incorporate an appropriate mix of uses to serve local needs.This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 23 'Development of main town centre uses outside of designated centres'. 13.17 The location and extent of new planned centres will be refined through the planning application process, and they will be designated and defined in subsequent plans, if appropriate. 234 13.18 The importance of local convenience stores, post offices and chemists outside centres in providing essential services to the community they serve is recognised. Such uses can be hubs of the community, important for community cohesion and have a valuable role to play in social inclusion. These uses are protected by Policy LP 44 'Protection of community facilities and services'.

They help make places more sustainable by meeting the community’s day-to-day needs. They comprise a range of social, recreational and cultural facilities and services, such as: Local convenience stores, post offices and chemists Play, open space and sports facilities Healthcare facilities Public houses Community centres and village halls Arts centres, music venues Theatres, cinemas Places of worship Education facilities Libraries Allotments Children’s centres. 14.2 Residents in the Borough’s neighbourhoods and villages are generally well served and the aim of this policy is to safeguard against the unnecessary loss of valued facilities where they collectively or individually make an important contribution towards the health and well-being of residents. 236 14.3 The NPPF states that local authorities should 'plan positively' for the provision of social, recreational and cultural facilities and guard against the loss of valued facilities and services where it would reduce the community's ability to meet its day-to-day needs. 14.4 Advancing the health and well being of residents is a key part of good planning. The loss of existing community facilities and services will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances, supported by robust evidence to justify the loss in accordance with the criteria set out above. This will help to ensure that all residents continue to have good access to the facilities and services they rely on. 14.5 Community uses are often lower value uses of land and are therefore more vulnerable to development pressures. This policy is focused specifically on land or buildings currently or last used for a community use and is less concerned about the current owner or occupier. 75 For a minimum of one year. 76 Commercial terms that are construed by the Council as being reasonable, i.e. at a sound, realistic and viable price for the type of use. 237 14.6 A valued community asset, such as a pub or community facility, can be nominated by a community organisation as an Asset of Community Value (ACV). If an application for an ACV is successful, the local community will be informed in the event that the property is listed for sale within the five year listing period. This will give the community an opportunity to enact a Community Right to Bid, allowing a period of six months to raise the finance to purchase the asset. Designation as an ACV will be a material consideration in the determination of a planning application. 14.7 This policy deals with the broader issue of retaining valued community facilities and services. The retention of retail uses in defined retail areas is covered by Policy LP 43 'Development proposals in centres'. KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (para 93) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. 238 14.2 Play, open space and sports provision 14.8 Play, open space and sports facilities are important for improving and maintaining quality of life. They include a wide range of open space, sporting and recreational facilities. 14.9 One defining characteristic of Bracknell Forest is its wealth of green infrastructure such as open space, trees and outdoor recreation which reflects the principles established in the creation of the Bracknell New Town. This legacy includes long standing sites such as Lily Hill Park which successfully combines sporting provision, preservation of a historic landscape and a haven for wildlife and people. The legacy has been continued in new developments such as The Parks which embrace the same ideals. Within the built-up areas of the Borough there are natural open spaces of various sizes that are in easy reach of the Borough’s residents and workers. 14.10 Regular use of natural open spaces and sports facilities is known to benefit health and wellbeing. An active healthy lifestyle provides benefits for the physical and mental health of residents. Access to open spaces, sports and recreational facilities has been a consistently popular aspect of life in Bracknell Forest with residents and visitors. To meet the needs of a growing population, and to maintain quality of life, these facilities should be protected, enhanced, maintained and supplemented with new or improved facilities close to where new developments will be located. 239 14.11 The protection and enhancement of play, open spaces and sports facilities is a core part of the Council’s strategy, therefore the loss of existing provision will be resisted. Policy LP 44 'Protection of community facilities and services' will protect existing facilities and ensure that new facilities are provided. Standards for the provision of OSPV are set out in Policy LP 46 'Standards for Open Space of Public Value'. 14.12 The Council will continue to mitigate the impact of new development on play, open space and sports facilities by: i. securing the provision of new facilities either in-kind or through financial contributions; and, ii. securing financial contributions towards the improvement of existing facilities. This will be through the Plus One Principle (where new developments provide contributions to increase the capacity of existing facilities) and to achieve other objectives such as biodiversity net gain. 14.13 Play, open space and sports facilities fall into two main categories: i. OSPV (e.g. parks, woodlands and sport pitches); and, ii. built sports facilities (e.g. sports halls, swimming / leisure pools, ice rinks, ski centres, gyms and fitness centres, indoor tennis centres, climbing walls, indoor bowls and other indoor sports facilities). 14.14 The land on which play, open space and recreational facilities are located is called OSPV and can be broadly classified as Active OSPV or Passive OSPV: 240 14.15 Active OSPV comprises children’s play areas, sports pitches and facilities, golf courses, skate parks, allotments, jogging/walking routes, school playing fields, artificial grass pitches, MUGAs and informal kick-about areas. 14.16 Passive OSPV comprises woodland, green corridors, SANG, nature areas, picnic areas and amenity open space. 14.17 OSPV can be classified as: i. public open space, which is land available for satisfying the recreational needs of the local community, such as pitches, play areas or country parks and is usually maintained by the Borough or Town and Parish Councils; and, ii. private open space, which is land that serves a similar purpose but may have restricted public access, such as golf courses, horse riding centres; or Ministry of Defence land which can include land with no public access. 14.18 In both cases, its public value is derived from its contribution either to the recreational needs of the community and/or from that which its openness makes to the character and appearance of the locality, and to the quality of life. In providing new OSPV, land will only count towards the OSPV standard if there is a guaranteed and secured community use of the space. This can include educational open land where it can be secured for the joint benefit of the school and the community. Exceptions to this could include sensitive ecological areas where there is a need to restrict public access. 14.19 Development proposals can provide new OSPV and built sports facilities to meet the needs of residents and/or contribute towards enhancing existing provision if they increase the capacity of the space to accommodate the residents from a new development. A development site might provide connectivity between two existing open spaces such as providing a wildlife corridor or walking route. However, such connecting routes will only count towards the OSPV standards if they include an element of useable open space alongside the connection such as a footpath with a wildlife corridor. 14.20 Opportunities to incorporate and enhance green infrastructure and to achieve BNG will be sought within play, open space and sports facilities where they are compatible with such uses. Therefore, this policy should be read and be implemented alongside Policy LP 53 'Biodiversity' and Policy LP 30 'Green infrastructure' to ensure effective delivery of open space and other Green Infrastructure assets. 14.21 PRoW and long-distance recreational routes such as the Bracknell Forest Ramblers Route or the Binfield Bridleway Circuit are valuable assets for local communities and should always be protected, unless alternative access can be provided to an acceptable standard and improved where possible.Where there is opportunity, improvements will be sought to the quality and accessibility of PRoW and other routes through widening, resurfacing, replacing stiles/gates and biodiversity projects. Where a PRoW is located in the countryside (including the Green Belt) enhancements should not negatively impact on their existing rural attributes.This reflects objectives set out in the Rights of Way Improvement Plan. 241 14.22 The Public Open Space and Sports (POSS) [(77)] Study identifies several opportunities to link PRoW routes in the Borough as well as improve their biodiversity value.The POSS policy framework is intended to work in conjunction with the POSS study projects and Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP). This will ensure developers can deliver identified projects to enhance the PRoW network and other routes. 14.23 There may be opportunities to change the function of an existing open space from one typology to another, such as changing an amenity space to a sports pitch to ensure that existing recreational facilities do not stagnate or where there is a surplus of a particular type.This could be acceptable where evidence demonstrates a shortfall in the open space typology that the intended change in function is proposed to fill. 14.24 In addition to its primary function, open space also contributes to cooling the urban environment. OSPV should also be designed to create safe and secure environments with appropriate lighting and passive surveillance. These matters should be considered in tandem with other policies in the Local Plan, including the consideration of light pollution under Policy LP 58 'Pollution and hazards'. 14.25 School playing fields can be a useful resource for the local community where, for example, they can be used for non-school activity at weekends. This provides the local community (e.g. football teams) a facility to use whilst generating an income for schools. Therefore, school playing fields may count wholly or partly (depending on conditions of usage) towards the amount of OSPV but only if they are secured for community use by agreement. 14.26 The countryside (including the Green Belt) can provide an important resource for recreational activities such as horse-riding and walking, on PRoW and in countryside parks and SANG. However, some activities can cause localised issues such as noise and traffic problems. Therefore, new recreational provision should be considered against matters such as landscape impact, residential amenity, character and openness, and other relevant policies in the Local Plan.

How this is achieved depends on the site circumstances, including the scale of development and SANG arrangements. The delivery of planned OSPV within a site will be secured by planning obligation and will normally include provision to secure its future maintenance and public access for the life-time of the development. OSPV on an alternative site, and provided by others, may be funded by the use of planning obligations. The strategy will include on-site provision of open space and financial contributions towards off-site provision which will be defined projects in various documents such as the Playing Pitch Strategy (PPS), Play, Open Space and Sports (POSS) and the IDP which will be delivered for the benefit of the development. 14.28 The type of provision will depend on local needs and projects identified by the Council. It should be noted that there is a particular need for more allotments and sports pitches (grass and artificial) as identified in the Bracknell Forest Playing Pitch Strategy (PPS) (2019) [(78)] . 78 4b https://www.bracknell - [forest.gov.uk/bflp](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/bflp-evidence-base) - evidence - base 243 14.29 The following table sets out the expected arrangements for meeting the OSPV standard set out in the policy for different site circumstances. In Table A row C (sites between 1 and 2 hectares), through good planning some on-site OSPV provision may be accommodated. 14.30 The standard is derived from a previous requirement of 30% on-site provision and 70% by financial contributions in-lieu of provision. 14.31 If new OSPV is transferred to the Council, a commuted maintenance sum will also be required for the assumed lifetime of the development. If more practical and of greater benefit, there will be the potential for off-site mitigation (towards providing, expanding, or improving local open space and/or recreational facilities) and/ or on-going maintenance.The Council may accept the private ownership of OSPV provided its public accessibility and maintenance is guaranteed. |Table A OSPV standards|Col2|Col3|Col4| ||||| |Site circumstances||Expected arrangements to meet the OSPV standard|| |A|Site over 2 hectares where an on-site SANG is provided.|1|There is no requirement for the on-site passive OSPV.

The standard requires the improvement of OSPV for example from a good quality rating to a very good quality rating using quality assessment criteria based upon Green Flag Award assessments. It was first developed in the Council’s study of open space [(79)] which supported the Core Strategy Development Plan Document (2008) and was subsequently adopted by the Council in the Parks and Open Spaces Strategy [(80)] . The quality auditing process has been repeated in the latest POSS study which recommended a continuation of the Plus One Principle as a quality standard to improve the quality of play, open space and sports facilities. 14.33 The Plus One Principle (Table B) will be used to quantify improvements to OSPV including to maintain OSPV which is already rated as excellent to keep it as an excellent rated space. New OSPV should meet the excellent standard with guaranteed maintenance to ensure its quality does not decline. Where development contributes towards off-site OSPV provision, financial contributions will fund quality and capacity improvements of existing OSPV. These projects will usually be carried out for the benefit of the development by the Council or the parish / town councils. Table B Plus One Principle ratings (based on Green Flag Award criteria) |Existing quality rating of OSPV|Improvement in quality| ||| |Very poor, poor or moderate quality|Good quality| |Good quality|Very good quality| |Very good quality|Excellent quality| |Excellent|Maintain excellent quality| 14.34 New OSPV should be readily accessible to its users (including fauna) in accordance with the following OSPV Accessibility Standards. Schemes to achieve these standards should be prepared in partnership with the Council who will develop projects across the Borough to achieve the desired OSPV provision. These will be a starting point in the consideration of planning applications with the overall aim to have comprehensive locally accessible OSPV across the Borough. 14.35 Links and pocket green spaces can be achieved through small biodiversity features such as hedgerow and tree groups. Linear green corridors with play and biodiversity features will be important in high density locations such as Bracknell Town Centre. The standards are designed for all types of provision whether they are large formal parks or small amenity areas within the local street scene. 79 Bracknell Forest Borough Study of open space, sports, recreational and leisure facilities.

Therefore sites within (or within close proximity to) Bracknell Town Centre will be considered on a case by case basis. It is expected that linear corridors with play areas, a skateboard area, a MUGA, trees and planting can be achieved to appropriate quantitative standards and be functional and effective when supplemented by financial contributions to improve off-site OSPV and accessibility to and from the site.

In order to avoid pressure for additional dwellings for rural workers there is also a need to consider carefully any proposals to remove existing occupancy restrictions on rural homes. This policy applies to land outside of defined settlements and so should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 34 'Green Belt' and Policy LP 35 'Development in the countryside'. 248 249 Rural workers dwelling 15.2 Rural workers are normally those involved in agriculture, or forestry, but in special circumstances may be associated with other rural-based enterprises such as equestrian uses. It will often be as convenient and more sustainable for such workers to live in the urban area of the Borough, or suitable existing dwellings, so avoiding new and potentially intrusive development outside of defined settlements. 15.3 However, there will be some cases where the nature and demand of work in agriculture, forestry and other rural industries makes it essential for one or more people engaged in the enterprise to live at, or very close to, the site of their work. Where the functional need for a new rural worker’s dwelling cannot be fulfilled by another existing dwelling or any other existing accommodation in the area, the provision of a temporary dwelling or construction of a new permanent dwelling will be permitted, subject to such proposals fulfilling all relevant policy requirements. Whether the need for a dwelling for an enterprise is essential in any particular case, as well as the size of the dwelling, will depend on the functional needs of the individual enterprise and not on the personal preferences or circumstances of any of the individuals involved. Convenience of being on site does not constitute an essential need. The need for a security presence will not on its own normally form an acceptable basis to justify a new dwelling. 15.4 All applications will need to pass both a functional and financial test. A functional test is necessary to establish whether it is essential, for the proper functioning of the enterprise, for one or more workers to be readily available at most times. 15.5 A financial test will also need to be passed to ensure that the rural enterprise is economically viable. The Council will take a robust approach to the assessment of the level of profitability, as these developments remain permanently in the location in spite of any failure of a rural enterprise.Therefore the financial test will assess whether the proposed dwelling can be sustained in the long term by the agricultural activity or enterprise, and the Council will expect to see details of how the enterprise is expected to develop. The applicant should ensure that 250 all necessary information is included with any planning applications in order for the Council to carry out to its satisfaction, the functional and financial tests. This includes budget books, recorded hours etc. 15.6 In order to justify a new rural worker’s dwelling an applicant must be able to conclusively demonstrate that all other potentially available dwellings on the agricultural unit or enterprise are already totally committed or are unsuitable. Where applications relate to units where only part of the land forming the enterprise is owned by the applicant, the Council will require evidence of land being held on a secure basis or the ready availability of suitable land. If a need is established, a new building should be sited so as to minimise the visual impact on the area, and the requirements of all relevant policies of the Development Plan will apply. The creation of new residential curtilages can adversely affect the undeveloped, rural character of an area, having an urbanising effect. Any new curtilage, and associated boundary treatment, should be proportionate to the size of the building, and be in keeping with the surrounding rural character. 15.7 For the purposes of Policy LP 47 'Dwellings for rural workers', criterion v, 'recently' is taken as being within the two years prior to the submission of a planning application and the applicant will be expected to confirm this matter. 15.8 If permission is given for a temporary dwelling, the period of the temporary permission will be clearly set out and extensions to the temporary period beyond three years will not be given, unless a satisfactory case can be made to the Council. If a permission is not implemented within a year of being granted, this will be used as evidence to indicate there is no functional need for the rural worker accommodation. If permanent permission is granted, or the agricultural or other use of the site ceases, the temporary dwelling will be required to be removed and the land restored, or where possible enhanced. 15.9 The Council will impose occupancy conditions on all new workers’ dwellings and where an additional dwelling on a farm holding is permitted, an occupancy condition may, in appropriate circumstances, be applied to the original farmhouse. Any proposal for an agricultural unit which it is considered could be affected by fragmentation will be subject to planning obligations to tie the dwelling(s) to adjacent farmland and buildings to prevent them being sold separately. In some circumstances, the Council may require an agreement under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 preventing the sale of the dwelling or parts of the land separately from the land forming the holding. 15.10 The Council will also consider removing certain permitted development rights for any dwelling permitted under this policy, to ensure that the dwelling remains at a size, which can be justified by the functional need and can be supported by the income from the agricultural unit. Occupancy conditions 15.11 Applications can be made to the Council for the removal of rural worker occupancy conditions. They will be the subject of careful consideration in order to assess whether a long term need for a rural worker’s dwelling remains.This will involve marketing the property for sale or rent for a period of at least 12 months at a realistic price to reflect the occupancy condition, and that any reasonable offers have not been rejected. 251 15.12 Occupancy conditions will not be removed from temporary permissions; if the temporary accommodation is no longer required, the accommodation should be removed and the site restored or where possible enhanced.

While the equine industry contributes significantly to both the local and national economy, development related to equestrian uses can have a significant impact on the rural area by way of physical structures (such as buildings and fences), and by increased usage of roads and bridleways. Such uses can be an important part of the rural economy although this must be balanced against the impact of the scale and nature of the proposed use. This policy applies to land outside of defined settlements so should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 34 'Green Belt' or Policy LP 35 'Development in the countryside'. 253 15.14 The NPPF advises that recreational facilities can make an important contribution to the health and wellbeing of communities. Whether planning permission is needed for the use of land and buildings for horses and equestrian activities depends on whether the horses are used for agricultural, recreational or commercial purposes. The need for planning permission arises when the land is used to keep horses for recreational or commercial purposes and not purely for grazing and other agricultural purposes. The use of land for grazing (which is part of the definition of agriculture in Section 336 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990) is widely taken to include the grazing of horses and so does not require planning permission. Recreation purposes could include riding on the land or supplementary feeding. If these circumstances exist, the land is no longer used for agricultural purposes but is used for the keeping of horses. Planning permission is necessary for this change of use. Stud farms, polo yards, riding schools, livery yards and other such equestrian facilities are considered to be a commercial use. If horses in these equestrian facilities are not part of a recognised agricultural unit or if horses within such a unit are not kept for agricultural purposes, the Council will require full planning permission for their keeping. This should include evidence to demonstrate why the proposal would be appropriate under the provisions of the NPPF. 15.15 Commercial proposals will be expected to include a supporting business case, justifying any built development proposed and providing evidence that the development is in accordance with equestrian best practice. This is because manèges or arenas, events, external lighting and higher levels of traffic can have a more intensive impact on the surrounding area. Where a business case is required the applicant will be expected to pay the Planning Authority’s reasonable costs for having it independently assessed. Proposals for development within the Green Belt will also be assessed against Green Belt policy in the NPPF and Policy LP 34 'Green Belt' of this Plan. 15.16 In order to recognise the intrinsic character and beauty of rural areas, the potential to make use of existing buildings should always be considered before the erection of new structures for equestrian purposes. Where this is not possible, the scale, siting and finish should be chosen to minimise visual impact and avoid prominent and isolated development. Field shelters and similar structures should not be constructed with such a degree of permanence that they could be adapted for other uses in the future. Large scale equestrian facilities should avoid exposed or prominent locations. This policy should also be read in conjunction with Policy LP 50 'Design'. 15.17 In considering proposals for all types of equestrian facilities, the Council will seek to ensure that the size and scale of the development, including any cumulative impacts, are appropriate to its intended use and to the land on which the development is situated. Careful attention should be given to the design, siting and landscaping details to avoid an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area and the amenity of neighbouring properties in terms of noise, smell, light or other general disturbances. Consideration should be given to the handling and storage of manure at the outset. This policy should also be read in conjunction with Policy LP 58 'Pollution and hazards'. Consideration should be given to highway safety for all road and bridleway users. Proposals that have good links to the bridleway network, or can deliver improvements to the bridleway network, will be supported. 254 15.18 Proposals for equestrian developments must have regard to the British Horse Society Standards (or any future equivalent) in terms of minimum requirements for housing horses and ponies, and the provision of adequate pasture land.

To meet and achieve these principles, the detailed matters of design that are set out in this policy will also need to be met. Consideration should be given to each aspect of this policy. Proposals will be expected to incorporate design elements to achieve high quality design. This design policy will be met by delivering high quality development that assesses each site individually to create attractive streets, buildings and spaces. 16.2 National policy attaches great importance to the design of the built environment and advises that Local Plans should include robust and comprehensive policies that specify the quality of development that will be expected for the area. The Council is committed to place making and has produced a number of supporting documents, as set out in the paragraphs below, to aid and facilitate high quality design being delivered in the Borough. 256 257 16.3 Good design is essential for all development irrespective of its location or type. All development proposals must demonstrate that they are in general conformity with the design principles set out in Policy LP 28 'Design principles', this policy and other relevant SPDs [(81)] published and adopted by the Council, notably the Design Supplementary Planning Document and Streetscene Supplementary Planning Document. The Council has produced additional guidance for applicants to help ensure developments fully respect the character of the local area. Of particular note is the Character Area Assessments Supplementary Planning Document, conservation area appraisals and management plans. The National Design Guide, first published in 2019, by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, should also inform development proposals. Neighbourhood plans are also material considerations when assessing planning applications. Other local context information can be found in design briefs for sites and village design guides which also provide local context analysis. Site, character and context 16.4 A well designed development relates positively to its surroundings and should be integrated into its context. Site appraisals are a key starting point in identifying local features and characteristics that may influence a design or technical approach on a site. Site information and assets such as trees and hedgerows, key views, how and where water drains, any site constraints or barriers etc., should all inform development proposals. Existing assets on a site or along a plot’s boundary or adjacent streetscene that have visual, ecological, or heritage value, or simply contribute to informing character in the area, should be retained and, where appropriate, enhanced. The Council will require appropriate site appraisals to be submitted with an application that clearly show how an analysis of the site has informed the proposed plans. Additional technical reports may also be required, depending on the site, size and location. 16.5 The topography of an area and the levels within a site are important to understand and successfully inform development. Existing levels and any changes to the levels on a site need to be carefully assessed within the context of the wider landscape and any existing development in the vicinity. Connectivity is a strategic design objective, as set out in Policy LP 28 'Design principles'. 16.6 The Council requires high quality design. This means that a proposal should create a sense of place and be desirable and workable for the local community. It should promote healthy lifestyles and create safe places to work and live in. Development at all scales will need to demonstrate high design quality. In some locations this will mean following a certain vernacular seen within the area. The Council’s Character Area Assessments Supplementary Planning Document can assist with this for certain defined parts of the Borough. In other locations it will mean creating identity and a sense of place. In all locations, care in relation to 81 www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/planning - and - building - [control/planning/planning](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning/planning-policy/supplementary-planning-documents) - policy/supplementary - planning - documents 258 the detailed design and the materials used will determine whether a development is perceived as high quality or not. Therefore, the Council will assess a scheme's location, context, scale, proportions, setting within a streetscene, contribution to character and identity, and its detailed design and quality of the materials, to assess the quality of design. The Council’s Design Supplementary Planning Document, clearly sets out the issues to consider when designing a development for submission within the Borough of Bracknell Forest. Efficient use of land, the built form and appropriate amenity 16.7 While achieving high quality design, there is also a need to use land efficiently. Designs should be tailored to the site, to ensure that it's potential is maximised. 16.8 It is important that new development integrates well into the existing context. How a built form sits on a site, whether its scale and height is appropriate to the plot size, character of the area and location, will be assessed to determine the appropriateness of the proposal. The massing of a building should not be overbearing within streetscenes, nor in relation to neighbours and/or adversely affect their private amenity. In some locations within the Borough, how a development appears in longer distance views will also need assessment. Roofscapes and their visual impact, particularly on sloping sites, need to be considered and should not adversely impact on views. 16.9 Proposals should always provide acceptable levels of privacy for residents. The relationship between built forms and how privacy is maintained, particularly with regard to private amenity space, will be considered in the determination of planning applications. Development should not adversely affect the amenity of the locality or surrounding properties, particularly in relation to shadowing and overlooking. Further guidance relating to the relationship between built forms is set out in the Design Supplementary Planning Document. Maintaining good levels of daylight and sunlight within new development is also important, particularly when promoting healthy communities. The Council will look to the standards set out in the BRE document “Site Layout planning for daylight and sunlight: a guide to good practice” (or any subsequent relevant updates or national standards) to assess acceptable levels of access to daylight and sunlight, particularly when assessing apartment blocks and higher density developments within the Borough. 16.10 Development should include appropriate levels of high quality public open space, as set out in Policy LP 46 'Standards for Open Space of Public Value'. For housing development, access to an appropriate level of usable, private amenity space should be provided. The size and number of bedrooms will inform what is considered an appropriate quantum of private amenity space. Longer areas of private amenity space maybe required for north facing back gardens, or where shade from existing trees reduce the size of the usable amenity space. Communal amenity spaces will also be considered if the design rationale for a site revolves around communal shared facilities. This would probably only be considered as appropriate on higher density housing development. Apartments should also have access to usable private amenity space in the form of balconies wherever possible. Access to communal amenity space is also expected to enhance a sense of community and provide a communal meeting place for residents. The size of any communal space for residents of apartments should reflect the size and scale of the apartment block. The design of an apartment block on a plot should create a balance between the built form, usable amenity space and parking provision. 259 Streetscenes and safe places 16.11 The design of streets often defines the quality of a place and informs its character. Streets should be more than just roads. If designed appropriately they should be safe places for people on foot and cyclists, as well as vehicles, and provide an element of visual amenity for street users. The Council is committed to the delivery of streetscenes of quality and has published a Streetscene Supplementary Planning Document. This document sets out the role of streets, how streets inform character, the different types of streets and technical guidance relating to the design of streets to meet both planning and Highway Authority objectives. Applicants will be required to use this SPD to inform their proposals. How proposals contribute to a streetscene, how streets are designed and how to use hard and soft landscaping within the street to maximise visual amenity, safety, robustness and future maintenance will be assessed in determining planning applications. The inclusion of trees within the streetscene is highlighted in the NPPF (Achieving well-designed places - para. 131). This reflects the contribution they can make to the character and quality of urban environments and their role in helping to mitigate the effects of climate change. 16.12 Boundary treatments have a wider role than simply defining plots and ownership. Boundary treatments can help define character within a neighbourhood and streetscene. Certain boundary treatments can be prevalent within certain areas. Referencing what is currently in place and maintaining and enhancing what exists within an area can help to integrate a new development within an established area and enhance its character. Where new development sites are creating new communities, the use of boundary treatments can contribute to a sense of place and character. Boundary treatments are extremely important in this respect. A strategy setting out how boundary treatments will respond to character within a development site, or details on a plot by plot basis for smaller sites, will need to be provided as part of any planning submission. 16.13 It is important that measures are designed into a development to promote a sense of safety and security for communities and building users. Good natural surveillance of public and private pedestrian and cycle routes should be provided by occupied development overlooking such routes. Similarly, development should front onto open spaces to provide a level of natural surveillance. Car parks and parking courts should also have good natural surveillance from the surrounding buildings and properties and include lighting to make these areas feel safe and usable at all times of the day and night. However, in some locations lighting solutions may need to be sensitive to any negative impacts on biodiversity and ecology and, in rural and semi-rural parts of the Borough, to character and the wishes of any existing communities. In some locations, lighting may not be considered appropriate for these reasons. Limiting the negative impact of climate change 16.14 The layout of streets, and the design and orientation of buildings can be used to maximise passive solar gain and to take advantage of natural ventilation methods. An assessment of building heights is needed to ensure all buildings receive appropriate levels of daylight and sunlight and that unacceptable shadowing is avoided. Landscaping and tree planting can assist in providing shade in parts of a development, such as within streetscenes, parking areas and public and private amenity areas. Planting should be deciduous to provide shade in the summer and let light through in the winter months. Further guidance is set out in the Council’s Sustainable Resource Management Supplementary Planning Document and in national guidance documents such as the National Design Guide published by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. 260 Inclusive design 16.15 All new development should be accessible to all members of the community. To create a fully inclusive environment for everyone, places, spaces, buildings, facilities and infrastructure should be designed and constructed for all to move through and access, with equal ease and safety. Opportunities to improve the accessibility of the existing environment, buildings and facilities should also be taken when development results in changes where works could be reasonably included to aid access. Waste and recyclable materials 16.16 Each development needs to provide for the efficient storage and collection of waste and recyclable materials. Waste and recycling should not be stored in the streetscene. Therefore, easy, level access should be provided to rear gardens for wheelie bins, food waste and recycling boxes. The design of apartment blocks should provide easy access for residents to communal waste and recycling storage locations, and ease of access for Council refuse collection vehicles within the parameters set by the Building Regulations. Similarly, for commercial buildings, ease of access to facilities for building users and collection companies will be expected.

Such buildings can use land efficiently, enclose key areas of public realm and can enhance a space, place or streetscene where they fit well into the urban landscape. Poorly designed or placed tall buildings can have a detrimental effect on the environment and on neighbours. They can block views and create a poor environment for their occupants if not designed and positioned well. 16.18 Therefore, it is important that some basic principles are followed when considering tall buildings. Assessment of the proposed location and design, ensuring that all impacts are carefully analysed, will form part of the decision making process. 262 16.19 A tall building is defined by its context, being: i. 5 storeys or 15m and above in Bracknell Town Centre; and/or ii. any building that is substantially taller than its neighbours in the Borough; and/or iii. its impact on the existing skyline within the Borough would be significant. 263 16.20 In considering proposals for the erection of tall buildings and additional floors to existing buildings, the following criteria will be taken into account: i. the character of the area; ii. the relationship between an individual site and adjoining land/buildings including any change in level; iii. the context within which the proposal will sit; iv. the design of the building; v. the impact on the local environment and micro climate; and vi. the impact on long range views. 16.21 When considering tall buildings, an assessment of the appropriateness of the location will be made. Consideration will be given to whether the proposal will achieve a coherent and compatible streetscene and whether the building will enhance the character of the area. The inter-relationship with existing buildings will also be an important factor in the assessment of the appropriateness of the location and proposal. Designs which are inappropriate in their context, or which fail to make good use of the opportunities for improving the character and quality of an area, will be refused. 16.22 Issues relating to the bulk and massing of a building will also be considered; permeability and legibility within the localised area will remain important. 16.23 Tall buildings in the Borough should be of an exemplary architectural design and create high quality living environments. Tall buildings should also achieve high standards of sustainability, maximising energy efficiency and construction methods using high quality materials. They also need to be functional and meet the needs of their occupants in the short and longer term, providing flexible spaces, particularly on the lower levels and at street level, to provide options for changing uses and future needs. 16.24 The design of the building should ensure that the entrances are clearly legible and usable for all members of the community, including when arriving as a visitor. Entrances also need to be coherently placed within existing streetscenes with the ground floor uses providing activation within, and natural surveillance of, the street. 16.25 Dwellings within tall buildings should be accessible and adaptable and provide high quality accommodation for all ages and abilities as set out in Section 12.2 'Accessible and adaptable dwellings'. 16.26 Provision for cars, cycles and bin and recycling collections will be needed along with delivery vehicles, maintenance equipment and emergency service vehicles. Unsightly plant on the roof will not be acceptable. 16.27 It is important that all proposals for tall buildings in the Borough are accompanied by high quality contextual analysis, demonstrating how the building will fit into the existing built environment to create positive views to and from the surrounding area. Proposals should be assessed through the submission of supporting material such as photomontages and/or 3D modelling outputs. 264 16.28 The assessment will need to consider the following aspects: the local vicinity (including consideration of the street scene, bulk and massing and the visual interest provided by the building itself); neighbouring areas (including neighbouring urban areas); longer distance views and panoramas (including to and from land in the countryside, Green Belt and beyond the Borough boundary); the skyline; and, the effect of the proposal, cumulatively, with other tall buildings. 16.29 It is good practice to agree with the Council the viewpoints to be considered when assessing landscape and visual impact. To assist in this process in respect of views into Bracknell Town Centre and adjoining areas, tall building viewpoints have been identified in Appendix 6: 'Maps of tall building viewpoints' as referenced below in the following locations: a. the western approaches to Bracknell from: the A329 (TB 1 and TB 2); Peacock Lane (TB 3); Wokingham Road (TB 4); and b. from the west and north of the Borough from: Johnstone Close, Bracknell (TB 5); Tilehurst Lane at the junction with Minchin Green in Binfield (TB 6); Binfield Road (TB 7 and TB 8); Cabbage Hill in the vicinity of the Forest Road car park entrance (TB 9); Sopwith Road - approach to the central roundabout (TB 10); and A330, Ascot Road in vicinity of junction with Weller’s Lane (TB 11). 16.30 For any individual proposal in Bracknell Town Centre and adjoining areas it will be the views from these points (where available) towards the proposal that should be assessed. Other views may also be important depending on the location of the building and further assessment and analysis may be needed. 16.31 For proposals outside Bracknell Town Centre and adjoining areas, consideration of view points will be required on a case-by-case basis. For proposals across the Borough, consideration should be given to Policy LP 35 'Development in the countryside', Policy LP 36 'Landscape character (outside of defined settlements) ' and Policy LP 34 'Green Belt'. 16.32 Careful analysis relating to the spacing of blocks will be needed and a tall building should not adversely affect neighbours or be overbearing. An assessment of the cumulative effect of tall buildings will be required. Particular consideration will be given to the cumulative effect of tall buildings on the skyline. The Council aims to achieve a coherent (rather than scattered) skyline in urban areas, with interesting form and graduation down from a central peak in Bracknell Town Centre. One tall building will not necessarily create a precedent for a street or area. 265 16.33 Detailed information will also be required on sunlight and shadowing impacts of any new building on the surrounding environment, neighbouring buildings and occupants of the proposed building. The Council will look to the most up to date and relevant guidance on best practice, currently provided by BS 8206-2 and the BRE publication “Site layout planning for daylight and sunlight; A guide to good practice” when assessing proposals. Wind modelling may also be required to show how a tall building is likely to affect localised wind speeds and to demonstrate that any unacceptable impacts are to be mitigated. Any proposal should also be accompanied by a lighting strategy to ensure that light pollution from tall buildings is minimised. 16.34 The Borough has many historic features and assets, including Listed Buildings, Conservation Areas and Registered Historic Parks and Gardens. Any erosion of the quality of their significance, including their settings will not be acceptable. 16.35 All tall buildings should also meet the objectives of Policy LP 28 'Design principles' and Policy LP 50 'Design'.

It is important therefore to have planning policy in place to ensure high quality design and enable proposals that would achieve this. 16.37 In considering applications for consent to display advertisements, the Council will have regard to the interests of amenity and public safety. This policy relates to all advertisements, not just those for retail premises. 16.38 The removal of existing signs will be sought where their function is duplicated or where they detract from the appearance or character of the area. In appropriate circumstances, the Council will seek additional control over the display of advertisements in residential areas. 267 16.39 Where advertisements are to be illuminated, consideration will be given to the level and type of illumination, taking into account guidance contained in the technical report “Brightness of Illuminated Advertisements” by the Institution of Lighting Engineers and any subsequent updates or replacements of this.Where appropriate, to reduce light pollution, conditions may be imposed to limit the hours of illumination. 16.40 The design of shop fronts will be expected to integrate with the retail streetscene, avoid the creation of “dead frontages” and be sympathetic to the character and appearance of the local environment. This may include the creation of windows with displays or design features that create variety and interest in the streetscene. 16.41 Visually intrusive security measures on shop fronts, such as external roller shutters, can be excessive and create an unwelcoming and hostile environment when closed; either outside of the shop's working hours or if the shop closes down. There are alternative methods of security that can be more acceptable, such as internal roller shutters or strengthened glass. 16.42 This policy builds on the changes to shop fronts and advertisements allowed by the General Permitted Development Order.

Under the Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006, all local authorities have a statutory duty to conserve biodiversity. 17.2 The Council is committed to the protection and enhancement of biodiversity and geodiversity. It will work with partners to ensure a proactive approach to protection, enhancement and management of biodiversity identified in national and local strategies and plans such as Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPs) and the emerging Green Infrastructure Strategy.The following policy seeks to ensure that biodiversity in the Borough is protected and enhanced. 269 17.3 Biodiversity is not confined to designated sites and every development has the potential to contribute towards the conservation of locally important habitats and species. 82 Inland freshwaters as defined by the Water Resources Act 1991 as amended 270 17.4 There are significant areas of habitat in the Borough which are an important local resource for supporting biodiversity including: woodland; hedgerows; ancient woodland and veteran trees; grasslands; watercourses and other wetlands; farmland; heathland; and other formal and informal areas of open space. This list is not intended to be exhaustive. 17.5 Priority habitats and species are those listed under section 41 of the NERC Act or in the Bracknell Forest Biodiversity Action Plan. These are an important local resource for supporting biodiversity. 17.6 Ecological surveys should be conducted by a suitably qualified or experienced ecologist. 17.7 Ecological surveys, assessments and mitigation measures should be implemented in line with current national standards and published guidance in addition to any guidance or advice endorsed by the Council. The requirement for BNG is separate from species protection and the Council will use the local list to require ecological surveys where relevant depending on local site conditions. 17.8 When considering a site for development, those involved should take account of any biodiversity resources on the site and design the development in a way that enhances them or at least avoids, or minimises, any negative impacts on them. Enhancements to the biodiversity value of a site, such as creating new habitats, should be incorporated into the design. The type or scale of development is not necessarily relevant to the biodiversity value. For example, a small site may have a very high biodiversity value. The level of work needs to be proportionate to the biodiversity value of the site. Creative solutions are possible on all sites, including small sites within urban areas. Examples of what would be expected are set out in accompanying guidance. 17.9 Developments are required to demonstrate how existing wildlife habitats such as trees, hedgerows, woodlands and rivers will be retained, safeguarded and managed during and after development, including the provision of buffers where required. Where necessary, a management plan outlining mitigation measures will be required to sensitively manage any issues affecting biodiversity resources arising as a result of the development. 17.10 To manage potential adverse effects of development on biodiversity, the mitigation hierarchy should be used as a sequential approach, completing each step before moving to the next with compensation being the last resort. In the first instance, development should try to avoid adversely affecting existing habitats by using alternative sites or layout designs.Where avoidance is not possible, and the need for, and benefit derived from development outweighs the harm to the nature conservation value of the site, habitat or species, the impact upon wildlife sites, habitat or species should be adequately mitigated. 271 17.11 Development should incorporate biodiversity improvements and secure at least a 10% measurable net gain for biodiversity. For the purposes of BNG, a biodiversity gain plan should be submitted as part of a planning application. The standard method for calculating biodiversity losses and gains and identifying the level of mitigation and compensation required is the Statutory Biodiversity Metric. Relevant guidance should also be applied, where available. 17.12 BNG can be achieved on site through planting schemes, new habitats, or through enhancement and management of existing habitats. The Council will provide guidance on how BNG will apply to development and how any residual offsite needs for compensation will be addressed. As part of this, the Council will also develop biodiversity projects across the Borough through the IDP process which will have a measurable biodiversity value. These schemes will be paid for and delivered by development as mitigation or compensation through planning obligations. 17.13 Wildlife corridors or ecological networks are important for linking habitats and allowing the movement of species across the landscape. They can include rivers, streams, railways, hedgerows, road verges, trees, incidental pieces of open space and residential gardens. The Council’s Green Infrastructure Review identifies habitat and ecological networks which incorporate these features. In addition, the Berkshire Biodiversity Strategy identifies five Biodiversity Opportunity Areas (BOAs) within Bracknell Forest as areas of greatest opportunity for restoration and creation of habitats.Where new development is proposed within an ecological network such as a BOA or Nature Recovery Network, opportunities for biodiversity improvements should be included and opportunities taken to link biodiversity across the wider landscape. Opportunities for Natural Flood Management, creating wetland features and reconnecting rivers with their floodplains should be considered, where appropriate, to enhance biodiversity and help manage flood risk. 17.14 The removal or degradation of biodiversity prior to submitting planning applications may include: ploughing or improving grassland, removing trees, refusing access for ecological surveys, stopping or starting habitat management, and situations where previous habitat mitigation has not been effective. To determine if any changes have been made, the current habitat type and condition of a site can be judged using an up-to-date ecology survey against aerial photography and land use data over time. Areas of habitat that have naturally developed over many years may be excluded on the basis of natural succession. 17.15 When the relevant provisions of the Environment Act come into effect, these will take precedence where Policy LP 53 'Biodiversity' is in conflict with it. 17.16 This policy has a strong relationship with other policies in this Plan including Policy LP 3 'Sustainable development principles', Policy LP 30 'Green infrastructure', Policy LP 28 'Design principles', Policy LP 54 'Protection and enhancement of trees and hedgerows' and Policy LP 58 'Pollution and hazards'. 272 KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (paras 8, 20 and Chapter 15) PPG (Natural Environment) Biodiversity 2020: A Strategy for England Wildlife and Ecosystem Services DEFRA The Natural Environment in Berkshire: Biodiversity Strategy (2014 – 2020) Bracknell Forest Biodiversity Action Plan (2018 – 2023) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications.

It is important that this resource is maintained and enhanced for people, the economy, biodiversity and the environment to benefit. 17.18 Trees and hedgerows provide wide ranging economic, environmental and social benefits, such as enhancing recreational experiences, improving health, enhancing natural and built landscapes and connecting habitat networks for wildlife. They will also continue to play an important function in mitigating the impacts of climate change, for example by moderating temperatures and attenuating water flow. They help to improve air quality through absorbing airborne pollution. The protection of existing assets and planting of new trees and hedgerows have a positive impact where they are provided. 17.19 Individually and collectively, trees and hedgerows make a valuable contribution to the high quality of life in the Borough, making it an attractive place for people to live and work. However future population and economic growth in the Borough will continue to exert pressure on the natural environment. Combined with the Borough’s ageing tree population, this creates some risk to the sylvan character of the Borough. 17.20 The purpose of this policy is to ensure that new development helps maintain and conributes towards sylvan character. 83 Identified by Blue Sky in the National Tree Map survey (2014) 274 275 Protecting trees and hedgerows 17.21 Trees and hedgerows make a significant contribution to townscape and landscape. Their sustainable retention and enhancement of valuable trees and native hedgerows will be sought in any development proposal to allow their natural ongoing development. 17.22 Wherever there are trees or hedgerows on or adjacent to a site that could be affected by a proposed development, a tree survey and arboricultural impact assessment, in accordance with British Standard 5837 ‘Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction’ (as amended or superseded) will be required. 17.23 In accordance with the requirements of the NPPF (para 180c), development will be required to protect and conserve irreplaceable habitats such as ancient woodland and ancient or veteran trees. Otherwise, development will not be supported, unless justified by wholly exceptional reasons and an appropriate compensation strategy is in place. 17.24 In considering a tree or hedgerow’s ‘value’, particular consideration will be given to whether individually or cumulatively they: i. make a visual contribution, presently or have the potential to do so in the longer term, to the character and appearance of the landscape or townscape; ii. contribute towards the verdant character of the streetscene; iii. provide an important ecological function, such as providing wildlife habitat or a green link between habitats; iv. visually soften the roofscape of a development within longer views, or the edge of built up areas; v. are of an internationally, nationally or locally rare or threatened species; vi. make a valued contribution to an area of historic significance; or vii. have the potential to be future ancient or veteran trees. 17.25 Development should not compromise the long-term health of trees and hedgerows or fetter their ongoing development. 17.26 Where there is no practical alternative and an element of encroachment into the root protection area of a tree is considered acceptable by the Council, the applicant will be required to work with the Council to find a design solution that minimises any adverse impact on the tree. 17.27 The size and type of appropriate buffer zones to separate development from woodland will depend on the scale, type and impact of the development, to be determined on a case-by-case basis in line with relevant guidance. 17.28 Where appropriate, the retention and protection of trees or hedgerows during demolition and construction will be secured through conditions on planning permissions. The ongoing protection of existing or newly planted trees will be secured through Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs), planning conditions or the designation of Conservation Areas as appropriate. 276 17.29 Where the Council accepts that the need for a development is exceptional enough to outweigh the loss of a valuable tree or hedgerow, appropriate mitigation will be sought in the form of compensatory planting that will provide a longer-term net gain in terms of quality and quantity. Loss of a valuable tree or hedgerow will only be considered acceptable where a robust justification is submitted to, and deemed acceptable by, the Council. Where an applicant is able to robustly demonstrate that compensatory planting cannot be provided on-site, the Council will secure off-site in kind works or a financial contribution for off-site tree and hedgerow compensatory planting as part of a planning permission, with a preference for provision close to the site. Tree and hedgerow enhancement 17.30 New development will be required to contribute towards maintaining and enhancing the Borough’s network of trees and hedgerows to ensure that Bracknell Forest’s verdant character and the value of this asset is not eroded over time. 17.31 Where a development requires landscaping, as a minimum, a landscaping strategy (or an indicative landscaping scheme for smaller proposals), will be required to be submitted with a planning application prior to determination. In circumstances when it is not feasible to provide the detailed planting specification, conditions will be imposed to require this to be submitted at an appropriate stage in the planning and development process. In order to obtain planning permission, the applicant will be required to demonstrate that the development layout is capable of accommodating a high quality landscaping scheme that fulfills policy requirements. 17.32 Opportunities should be taken to incorporate such features as green roofs, roof gardens and green walls. On constrained sites, or sites with limited opportunities to provide a net gain in landscape quality, off-site provision may be agreed by the Council. This will be either in kind, or by financial contribution, with a preference for provision close to the site. This could include public realm or street tree planting. 17.33 Developers are required to ensure coordination between the location of utilities and tree planting, and that trees are planted with correct soil volumes and appropriate root protection. This is to ensure the proper establishment of trees and prevent future conflict between trees and utilities. To demonstrate this, utility plans should be submitted alongside or layered onto landscaping plans to demonstrate that the landscaping proposed is achievable and would not be compromised by the laying of services. 17.34 In addition, to avoid future conflict between existing and new trees, and built structures, developers must give proper consideration to the appropriateness of a development's build specification. This may include the type and depth of foundations, taking full account of a tree's future growth potential above and below ground. 17.35 Conditions will be used to secure post-planting care to ensure the survival of new planting during its establishment, and for replacement planting if any plants die, fail to establish or are removed within a set period of time. 277 KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (paras 136 and 180) Natural England and Forestry Commission guidance (standing advice) PPG (Natural Environment Reference ID: 8) Bracknell Forest Tree Strategy (2017) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications Use of planning conditions and obligations. 278 18 Environmental sustainability 18.1 Sustainable construction 18.1 The Government is committed to addressing climate change, through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, supporting energy efficiency and avoiding the profligate use of resources. The Climate Change Act (2008, as amended) sets a target for the UK to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. National policy highlights the importance of the planning system in supporting a transition to a low carbon future. The Council has set out its commitment to address the causes and impacts of climate change. In 2020, the Council published the Climate Change Strategy 2020-24 [(84)] which includes detailed action plans and measurable ambitious annual targets to ensure that the Council meets the government target of eradicating its net contribution to climate change by 2050. 18.2 The delivery of sustainable development is the key theme running through this Local Plan. As the Borough needs to accommodate significant housing and economic growth during the plan period, this will increase the need for energy and water consumption. This impact can be mitigated by developing sustainable communities and encouraging lower energy consumption through energy efficient design of sites, buildings and services. Mitigation can also be provided by renewable and low carbon energy technologies and reducing water consumption. The following policy sets out measures to help address climate change through applying construction standards. 84 https://www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/council - and - [democracy/strategies](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/strategies-plans-and-policies/climate-change/climate-change-strategy) - plans - and - policies/climate - change/climate - change - strategy 279 Carbon emissions 18.3 All major new dwellings will be encouraged to contribute towards the target of net zero carbon for regulated emissions (energy used to provide space heating and cooling, hot water and fixed lighting), to be achieved on site. If it is demonstrated that this is not viable, an improvement in regulated emissions over the target emissions rate in Part L of the Building Regulations, plus a section 106 contribution to offset any remaining carbon emissions to zero is encouraged. This will be charged at a rate of £1,800 per remaining tonne towards carbon offsetting for specific schemes within the Borough (calculated as £60/tonne over a 30 year period). [(86)] The order of preference for achieving net zero carbon is as outlined above, but if there are overwhelming benefits in being able to meet the net zero carbon requirement in another way, clear evidence should be provided to demonstrate how it will be achieved at the planning application stage. 18.4 An Energy Statement submitted in support of an application needs to set out how the development will comply with the carbon reduction requirements and how emissions will be monitored effectively to ensure compliance continues. The Sustainable Resource Management Supplementary Planning Document will be revised to set out further detail on how developments can achieve net zero carbon for regulated emissions. 85 As defined in the NPPF Annex 2 Glossary: for housing, development where 10 or more homes will be provided, or the site has an area of 0.5 hectares or more. For non-residential development it means additional floorspace of 1,000m 2 or more, or a site of 1 hectare or more. 86 The rate of £60 per tonne over a 30 year period is widely adopted by Greater London Authorities and is based on the non-traded price of carbon in a government consultation. The price per tonne of carbon will be kept under review and may change. 280 Water efficiency 18.5 The prudent use of water resources can reduce the impact on the environment and achieve sustainability objectives. The Environment Agency (EA) produced the Water Stressed Areas classification in 2021. This looked at the current and future water usage and climate change scenarios, indicating the stress situation for individual water companies. The areas covered by the two water companies supplying properties in the Borough are classified as being at “serious stress”, which is the highest of the three available ratings. 18.6 Part G of the Building Regulations 2010 (with 2015 and 2016 amendments) prescribe 125 litres/person/day as a mandatory standard for new dwellings. However, if it can be justified by LPAs, Part G may be used to apply a more stringent optional standard of 110 litres/person/day. The Bracknell Forest Water Cycle Study Scoping (2017) supports the 110 litres/person/day optional standard, which is in line with the general principles of sustainable development, reduces the energy consumed in the treatment and supply of water and would be at nominal additional cost to the developer. BREEAM 18.7 The Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) is an internationally recognised method of assessing, rating and certifying the sustainability of buildings. BREEAM assesses criteria covering a range of issues including energy and water use, location and accessibility, building fabric and materials, waste recycling, pollution and ecology. A building’s performance is assessed to provide an overall BREEAM rating which ranges from ‘pass’ to ‘outstanding’. The Council will seek at least a BREEAM ‘excellent’ rating or equivalent for new non-residential and non-C3 forms of residential development of 500m 2 (GEA) or above (including change of use and conversions). Where it is not viable to achieve BREEAM ‘excellent’ rating, this must be clearly demonstrated and developments must meet the BREEAM ‘very good’ standard. Assessments should be completed by an accredited assessor. 18.8 The above policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 50 'Design'. 281 KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (paragraphs 7, 8, 152, 154) PPG (Renewable and low Carbon – Reference ID:5, Climate Change – Reference ID:6, Water Supply, wastewater and water quality – Reference ID:34, Housing: Optional technical standards – Reference ID:56) Bracknell Forest Water Cycle Study Stage 1 Scoping Report (2017) Bracknell Forest Water Cycle Study Stage 2 (2018) Bracknell Forest Local Plan Viability Testing Report and Addendums (2020, 2021) Water Stressed Areas Classification (EA, 2021) Part L of the Building Regulations Part G of the Building Regulations DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications. 282 18.2 Renewable and low carbon energy 18.9 The Planning Act 2008 introduced a duty on LPAs local development plans to include policies which ensure that they contribute to both climate change mitigation and adaption. The NPPF states that LPAs should adopt proactive strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change and support the delivery of renewable and low carbon energy and associated infrastructure. It also states that planning should support the transition to a low carbon future in a changing climate and encourage the use of renewable resources, for example by the development of renewable energy. 18.10 Developments for renewable and low carbon energy may include solar farms, wind turbines, biomass, district heating or combined heat and power (CHP) from renewable resources. Renewable and low carbon development of over 50 megawatts capacity are currently considered by the Secretary of State for Energy. LPAs are responsible for renewable and low carbon energy developments of 50 megawatts or less installed capacity. Microgeneration (small scale generation, usually for domestic use) is often permitted development and may not require planning permission. Where renewable and low carbon schemes encouraged by Policy LP 55 'Sustainable construction' are not permitted development, they will be assessed against this policy. 283 18.11 The visual impact on the landscape and other sensitive areas will be a key consideration in determining applications. This includes cumulative impacts which may arise where two or more renewable energy developments will be visible from the same point or from points close to each other. The PPG provides further detail on planning considerations for assessing renewable and low carbon energy proposals. 18.12 The NPPF states that local plans should identify suitable areas for renewable and low carbon energy sources, and supporting infrastructure, where this would help secure their development.The NPPF requires that, when determining applications for wind energy, proposals involving one or more turbines should not be considered acceptable unless: the site is in an area identified as suitable for wind energy development in a development plan or SPD; and, following consultation, it can be demonstrated that the planning impacts identified by affected local communities have been appropriately addressed and the proposal has community support. 18.13 Where suitable areas for renewable and low carbon energy have been identified in plans, LPAs should expect any subsequent applications for a commercial scale project outside these areas to demonstrate that the proposed location meets the criteria used in identifying suitable areas. 18.14 The Bracknell Forest Council Renewable and Low Carbon Energy Potential Study (2011) [(87)] has assessed wind, biomass, geothermal, solar and waste resources to understand the likely potential renewable energy capacity of the Borough. This assessment showed that there is limited renewable energy resource to support significant new low carbon generation capacity. The study identified four very small areas suitable for wind turbines within the northern 2 part of the Borough, close to its boundary and totaling 2.8km .

The NPPF is clear that opportunities should be taken to reduce the overall level of flood risk, through the layout and form of development which can include the use of SuDS. Developers are encouraged to include SuDS early in the design of a scheme and promote the efficient use of land by combining them with other uses, such as open space. SuDS also provide the opportunity to improve water quality to mitigate the impact of development with benefits for amenity, recreation and wildlife. 285 18.16 National policy is clear that opportunities should be taken to reduce the overall level of flood risk, through the layout and form of development. This can include the use of SuDS. The Bracknell Forest Level 1 and Level 2 SFRAs [(89)] also supports the use of SuDS within developments. 18.17 SuDS are designed to control surface water run-off close to where it falls and replicate natural drainage. They can: a. reduce the causes and impacts of flooding; b. remove pollutants from urban run-off at source; and, c. combine water management with green space, with benefits for amenity, recreation and wildlife. 18.18 The Bracknell Forest Level 1 and Level 2 SFRAs [(90)] identified the areas at risk of flooding from all sources in the Borough and the Local Flood Risk Management Strategy (2017) [(91)] sets out the Borough’s objectives and approaches to managing the risk.The provision of SuDS in new developments is key to managing flood risk. In accordance with national policy 88 As defined in the NPPF Annex 2 Glossary: for housing, development where 10 or more homes will be provided, or the site has an area of 0.5 hectares or more. For non-residential development it means additional floorspace of 1,000m 2 or more, or a site of 1 hectare or more. 89 https://www.bracknell - [forest.gov.uk/bflp](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/bflp-evidence-base) - evidence - base 90 https://www.bracknell - [forest.gov.uk/bflp](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/bflp-evidence-base) - evidence - base 91 https://www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/crime - and [-](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/crime-and-emergencies/flooding/flood-risk-management) emergencies/flooding/flood - risk - management 286 it is important that all new developments in areas at risk of flooding should give priority to their use. Therefore, major developments and development in areas at risk of flooding must incorporate SuDS, unless it is demonstrated to be inappropriate. The provision of SuDS is encouraged for all development. 18.19 Information on flood risk is being updated continuously and flood risk identified in the SFRAs may change.The most up to date flood risk information should always be used, including the latest SFRA and the Flood Zones identified by the EA Flood Map for Planning. 18.20 Incorporating SuDS within a proposed development should be done in the early stages of the design process as it is an intrinsic part of the layout and design of a scheme. The design of any SUDs needs to have regard to and be informed by the Council’s principles in the latest Bracknell Forest Local Flood Risk Management Strategy [(92)] . SuDS can be used in tandem with other site requirements, such as biodiversity (Policy LP 53 'Biodiversity') and OSPV (Policy LP 46 'Standards for Open Space of Public Value') to promote the efficient use of land. Early consideration of the location and type of SuDS that may be suitable will ensure land take is kept to a minimum. The appropriate design of a site incorporating SuDS can do much to make an unsuitable site suitable for development, through innovative design and appropriate engineering solutions. 18.21 SuDS solutions should be selected in accordance with the hierarchy of drainage options as follows: a. into the ground; b. to a surface water body; c. to a surface water sewer, highway drain, or another drainage system; and, d. to a combined sewer. 18.22 Where discharging to a surface water sewer, confirmation of allowable discharge rates should be sought from the sewage undertaker. Appropriate investigations should be undertaken to determine the viability of infiltration at all development sites. 18.23 The Council will need to be satisfied that there are clear arrangements in place for on-going maintenance and that the proposed SuDS solution will meet the needs of the proposed development, over its lifetime, and taking account of climate change. The SuDS must be designed with consideration to the long-term maintenance costs.These should be proportionate and avoid excessive costs to future owners/occupiers. 18.24 The Council will consider adopting SuDS through Section 38 Highway Agreements, OSPV and within SANGs. Early consultation with the adopting authority is essential. If SuDS are to be privately owned and maintained then a fee to inspect and monitor their on-going maintenance may be sought through section 106 agreements. 18.25 LPAs are also required to consider the impact on water quality when granting planning permission. Provision of SuDS provides the opportunity to put in place sufficient water quality treatment to mitigate the impact of development. The Bracknell Forest Water Cycle Study Scoping (2017) [(93)] and the Thames River Basin Management Plan (2015) [(94)] supports the provision of SuDS as a means of disposing of surface water and addressing water quality. 92 https://www.bracknell - forest.gov.uk/crime - and [-](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/crime-and-emergencies/flooding/flood-risk-management) emergencies/flooding/flood - risk - management 93 https://www.bracknell - [forest.gov.uk/bflp](https://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/bflp-evidence-base) - evidence - base 94 [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/thames](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/thames-river-basin-district-river-basin-management-plan) - river - basin - district - river - basin - management - plan 287 18.26 The Bracknell Forest Local Flood Risk Management Strategy (2017) [(95)] provides further detailed advice on SuDS provision for each stage of a planning application and the Design SPD (2017) [(96)] provides advice on information that designers should consider when developing a masterplan.

It includes, but is not necessarily limited to, noise, vibration, smoke, fumes, gases, dust, steam, odour and artificial light pollution. Hazards relate to land stability, such as landslides and subsidence. Improvements to the quality of the environment in these regards can enhance health and well-being, helping to facilitate sustainable communities. The planning system has an important role in protecting the natural environment and addressing public health issues linked to poor air and water quality and noise pollution. 18.28 The purpose of this policy is to minimise and reduce pollution and hazards from new and existing developments (including cumulative impacts). 18.29 The policy has two aims: to ensure new development proposals do not generate pollution or hazards which unduly impact on the surrounding environment; and, to ensure development proposals are not unacceptably affected by existing pollution or hazards. 18.30 It is important that existing lawful uses do not become unable to continue their operations due to subsequent new development. A separate policy applies to development of land potentially affected by contamination which mainly relates to historic land uses. This policy applies in addition to national policy and other legislation. 289 18.31 National policy states that both new and existing development should not contribute to, or be put at unacceptable risk from, or be adversely affected by unacceptable levels of soil, air, water or noise pollution or land instability.This includes cumulative effects (NPPF, paragraphs 185 and 187). The cumulative impact of developments will be a key consideration for development proposals, including both existing and proposed developments during the construction phase and once operational. 18.32 Whilst there is legislation to control emissions from polluting activities, the planning system has a complementary role in directing the location of development that may give rise to pollution or hazards.This can manifest itself either directly from the development or indirectly, for example, through the traffic it generates. The NPPF is clear that the impact of pollution is a material planning consideration. 18.33 The Council is committed to protecting existing good environmental quality and where possible reducing adverse effects on the local and natural environment as a result of changes in activities or from new development. Development proposals should seek to maintain existing good environmental quality and improve quality where possible, including seeking opportunities for nature-based solutions. Opportunities for such improvements should be incorporated at the design stage or through a development's operation. 18.34 Development proposals should seek to avoid generating pollution where possible, and to reduce or limit the entry of pollutants that present a significant threat to the natural environment, including aquatic environments. Proposals should seek to minimise the risk and effects of hazards such as land stability, and wherever possible bring unstable land back into use. Development proposals should not result in a hazard or hazards prejudicial to the future use of any energy generation site or to surrounding land. 18.35 Proposals which are either likely to generate or are sensitive to pollution or hazards will require a relevant assessment based on current guidance and/or best practice upon submission of an application. Where assessments cannot be made at the application stage, for example, if the final technology decisions have not been made, it may be required by condition. 290 18.36 Where mitigation measures are proposed, the Council will need to be convinced that the proposed measures will be effective with respect to human health and wellbeing, property, water sources and the wider natural environment. Where possible, improvement is sought. These measures should be in place at an early stage of the development, for example, SuDS provide an ideal opportunity to provide mitigation for some pollutants. 18.37 Sensitive uses include: dwellings, hospitals, schools, nurseries, residential care and nursing homes. Artificial lighting 18.38 Many forms of artificial lighting can be beneficial, for example through extending opportunities for sport and recreation. However, in some circumstances, the installation of lighting can be intrusive and result in light pollution. In Bracknell Forest, the amount of artificial lighting clearly distinguishes rural and urban areas. The NPPF states that through good design and planning policies, the impact of light pollution from artificial light on local amenity, intrinsically dark landscapes and nature conservation can be limited (NPPF, paragraph 185). 18.39 Light pollution is caused by a number of factors including: a. sky glow – the orange glow seen around urban areas at night, b. glare – the uncomfortable brightness of a light source when viewed against a dark background, and c. light trespass – the spill of light beyond the target area for a light. 18.40 Artificial light pollution can have a significant effect on the character of the area, particularly in rural areas, making them seem more urbanised, for example sporting facilities with floodlighting. It can also intrude on the amenity of local residents or adversely affect the biodiversity of an area. Many species' natural rhythms depend on day-night and seasonal and lunar changes which can be impacted by artificial lighting levels. Care should be taken in the design of development proposals near to sites protected for their biodiversity or ecologically sensitive areas (such as ponds, lakes, watercourses, areas of conservation value, habitats used by protected species). Development proposals should not directly illuminate bat roosts or important areas for nesting birds. 18.41 For maximum benefit, the best use of artificial light is about getting the right light, in the right place and providing light at the right time. Light pollution can be substantially reduced, without adversely affecting the purpose of the equipment being installed, by ensuring that light is directed properly, switching off lights when not in use and avoiding ‘over-lighting’. Reducing light pollution can be beneficial in making developments more sustainable by using less energy. 18.42 Development proposals for new floodlighting and other external lighting likely to have a detrimental impact on neighbouring occupiers, the rural character of an area or biodiversity should provide effective mitigation measures. Providing data in an isolux diagram can be used to demonstrate any such effects. 18.43 Further reference is made to lighting in several policies in this plan in relation to both specific types of development and the impact of lighting. Related policies include, Policy LP 49 'Equestrian uses', Policy LP 45 'Play, open space and sports provision', Policy LP 50 'Design', Policy LP 51 'Tall buildings', Policy LP 52 'Advertisements and shop fronts', Policy LP 31 'Designated nature conservation and geological sites' and Policy LP 53 'Biodiversity', and site specific policies. 291 Noise and vibration 18.44 National policy states that new developments should avoid noise giving rise to significant adverse impacts on health and quality of life and recognise that development will often create some noise. Existing lawful businesses wanting to develop in continuance of their business should not have unreasonable restrictions put on them (NPPF, paragraph 187). 18.45 Noise can be broadly classified into two forms: neighbourhood noise (generated within the community such as construction noise, licensed premises, air conditioning plants, street noise, excluding noise from traffic) and environmental noise (noise from transport such as roads/ rail/ aircraft). 18.46 Development proposals which may generate significant levels of noise and vibration should include consideration of their impact on the quality of life of recipients in existing nearby properties and also the intended new occupiers. They should take a precautionary approach to ensure they will not be subject to harm. Development proposals that take opportunities to improve the acoustic environment should be supported. Noise mitigation measures should also not compromise the amenity of occupants, e.g. if measures involve sound insulation such as acoustic glazing or an alternative measure of ventilation which relies upon windows being kept closed in order to achieve acceptable internal noise levels. Applicants may be required to submit a working method statement compliant with BS 5228-1: 2009 + A1: 2014. 18.47 Development proposals should aim to meet the following internal and external noise standards [(97)] for residential developments: Table 16 Noise standards |Room|Time|Noise level| |||| |Bedrooms|Night (23.00 – 07.00)|30 dB LAeq (Individual noise events should not exceed 45 dB LAmax)| |Living rooms|Day (07.00 – 23.00)|35 dB LAeq| |Outside amenity space|Day (07.00 – 23.00)|50 dB LAeq| 18.48 Reference will also need to be made to any specific local technical policy guidance produced by the Council. 18.49 Noise and vibration can adversely impact upon biodiversity (including designated sites) depending on their site specific vulnerabilities. Care should be taken in the design of development proposals near to sites protected for their biodiversity or ecologically sensitive areas (such as water bodies, areas of conservation value or habitat used by protected species). This should ensure that development proposals, either individually or cumulatively, do not significantly affect such areas. Further assessments may be necessary to assess these impacts and to inform mitigation where appropriate. This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 31 'Designated nature conservation and geological sites', Policy LP 50 'Design' and Policy LP 53 'Biodiversity'. 18.50 Development proposals in areas significantly affected by aircraft, road or rail noise will be supported where the applicant can demonstrate effective mitigation measures. 97 Based on World Health Organisation – Guidelines for Community Noise 292 Air quality 18.51 The planning system has a role to play in protecting sensitive uses from poor air quality. The NPPF states that policies should sustain and contribute towards compliance with relevant limit values or national objectives for pollutants. This should take into account the presence of Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs) and the cumulative impacts on air quality from individual sites in local areas (NPPF, paragraph 186). 18.52 In Bracknell Forest, all national air quality objectives are being met except for nitrogen dioxide at two locations, where AQMAs have been declared. These are: Bracknell AQMA - the A322 Bagshot Road and Downshire Way from Berkshire Way to junction with B3430. Crowthorne AQMA - Part of the B3348, High Street and part of Sandhurst Road. 18.53 It is therefore important to ensure that development proposals, either individually or cumulatively, do not significantly affect occupants within or adjacent to an AQMA by generating unsatisfactory air quality. They should include suitable measures to prevent and mitigate their air quality impact, including any effect on AQMAs in the future. Applicants should consider air quality impacts at the earliest stage possible. Development which may have an impact on an AQMA should be consistent with the latest Air Quality Action Plan. 18.54 The Public Health Outcomes Framework for England [(98)] includes an indicator of mortality associated with air pollution (based on levels of PM 2.5 ). It is estimated that the fraction of mortality attributed to particulate air pollution is 5.7% (2018) in Bracknell Forest. Any reduction in particulate matter levels will contribute to improving health. Directors of Public Health are encouraged to prioritise action on air quality in their local area to help reduce the health burden from air pollution. Local authorities are encouraged to work towards reducing emissions and concentrations of PM 2.5 . 18.55 Development proposals should seek to improve air quality by reducing reliance on petrol and diesel vehicles and supporting alternative modes of sustainable travel. Measures to prevent and offset the impact on air quality arising from new development should be considered. 18.56 In accordance with the PPG, when assessing development proposals consideration should be given to whether the proposed development would: significantly affect traffic in the immediate vicinity of the proposed site or further afield; introduce new ‘point’ sources of air pollution or lead to deterioration in air quality; expose people to existing sources of air pollutants or poor air quality; give rise to potentially negative impacts (such as dust) during construction for nearby sensitive locations; and, affect biodiversity. 18.57 Pollution that affects air quality can also impact upon biodiversity and protected habitats, such as SPA, SAC and SSSI. A precautionary approach will be taken to such areas to ensure they are not subject to harm. 98 [https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/public](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/public-health-outcomes-framework) - health - outcomes - framework 293 18.58 Applicants will be required to undertake air quality modelling and assessment where necessary to address the effects on human health and biodiversity. This will be provided or funded by the applicant and include consideration of issues such as street canyons, site layouts and levels and the location of sensitive receptors. Guidance for the assessment of air pollution effects on habitats sites has been agreed with Natural England and is available from the Council. The Council will develop guidelines for assessment of air pollution effects on SSSIs if appropriate and in consultation with Natural England. 18.59 Air quality also relates to situations where odour associated with particular uses, such as commercial, industrial, agricultural or sewage related activities, may affect quality of life. 18.60 This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 31 'Designated nature conservation and geological sites' and Policy LP 53 'Biodiversity'. Water quality 18.61 The Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) Regulations (2017) apply to surface water and groundwater, seeking to prevent deterioration of aquatic ecosystems and protect, enhance and restore water bodies to ‘good’ status. The PPG states that LPAs must have regard to the EA's River Basin Management Plans (RBMP).These plans contain the main issues for the water environment and the actions needed to tackle them. 18.62 The Thames RBMP identifies that all six stretches of water bodies in the Borough had an Overall Waterbody Status of 'moderate' in 2019, failing the Water Framework Directive objective of 'good' status by 2015. Several reasons for not achieving 'good' status across the Borough are cited [(99)] . Several of the waterbodies are 'heavily modified'. 18.63 The Borough is in a 'Nitrates Directive Protected Area', a 'Drinking Water Protected Area' and a ‘Surface Water Safeguard Zone’ where land use is at risk of influencing the quality of water that is used for drinking. 18.64 In 2015, groundwater bodies in the Borough were achieving 'good' overall status, deteriorating to 'poor' in 2019 for the Chobham Bagshot Beds, as a result of suspected diffuse agricultural pollution. The current RBMP identified that across the Thames River Basin as a whole, groundwater is a key source of drinking water. The northern part of the Borough is in a ‘Groundwater Source Protection Zone’ (water entering the ground in this area is presumed to reach a water abstraction point). 18.65 The Private Water Supplies (England) Regulations 2016 makes Councils responsible for the monitoring and risk assessment of private water supplies (including private distribution systems). Development proposals involving a private water supply should be accompanied by a risk assessment to demonstrate that drinking water will be/remain wholesome. 18.66 It is therefore important to ensure that development proposals, either individually or cumulatively, do not significantly affect the quality of controlled waters or impact upon biodiversity (including designated sites) through changes to water quality and/or water flow regimes. It is essential water quality is not compromised in the vicinity of any private water supplies. 99 Reasons cited for not achieving 'good' status include physical modification and urbanisation affecting invertebrates and fish migration; physical barriers to fish migration; sewage discharge affecting phosphate, ammonia, macrophytes and phytobenthos and invertebrates; agriculture and rural land management; surface water abstraction; and recreation. 294 18.67 Development proposals should seek to improve the quality of controlled waters. This may include the use of high quality SuDS, appropriate drainage strategies, and naturalising heavily modified watercourses (such as culverted watercourses running through urban areas). This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 57 'Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)', Policy LP 31 'Designated nature conservation and geological sites' and Policy LP 59 'Development of land potentially affected by contamination'.

Making use of contaminated land benefits the environment by cleaning the site and also utilising previously developed land. However, it is important that the health and quality of life of existing or future occupiers (‘receptors’) are not put at risk. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that where potential contamination is a consideration, the planning approach is effective and consistent. 18.69 The policy aims to ensure that the extent, scale and nature of potential contamination is properly assessed and that any potential risks to human health, property, nature conservation and water quality are established, and addressed accordingly. The policy applies where development proposals are on, or near a site known or suspected to be potentially contaminated, or if a sensitive use is proposed. A separate policy (Policy LP 58 'Pollution and hazards') applies to proposed land uses that may generate or be put at risk from unacceptable levels of pollution and hazards. This policy applies in addition to national policy and other legislation. 296 18.70 Using PDL (NPPF paragraph 119) can enable development in the most sustainable locations. However, if the land is potentially contaminated, it is important that the health and quality of life of existing or future occupiers are not put at risk and are enhanced where possible. Failing to deal adequately with contamination could cause harm to human health, property and the wider environment. 18.71 The control of pollution and contamination is a complex process involving both the Council and other statutory bodies. The NPPF is clear that the impact of pollution is a material planning consideration when proposed development may expose people, the natural environment, property, water bodies, or other receptors, to levels of contamination which create unacceptable risks to health or other adverse impacts. 18.72 Both surface water and groundwater can be seriously affected by development and uses occurring within sites. Therefore, adequate measures are required to protect the quality of water. This is particularly important over a principal aquifer and in Groundwater Source Protection Zones (SPZs), which are areas identified [(101)] as at risk from potentially polluting activities, often found around wells, boreholes and springs. SPZs are designated for all groundwater supplies intended for human consumption. Where appropriate, the Council will liaise with the EA and water companies in relation to measures that affect surface and ground waters. 18.73 For the purposes of this policy, ‘near a site’ is usually within 250m, but may depend on the potential contamination identified. 100 A receptor is something that could be adversely affected by a contaminant e.g. a person, an organism, an ecosystem, property, or controlled waters (DEFRA, 2012). Controlled Waters include groundwater, some of which may be defined as Source Protection Zones. 101 The Environment Agency identifies Source Protection Zones 297 18.74 The possibility of contamination should always be considered, particularly when development proposals involve sensitive uses. These uses include: housing with gardens, hospitals, schools, nurseries, residential care and nursing homes, parks and recreational spaces. 18.75 Potentially contaminated sites will require a Phase 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment (or relevant assessment based on current guidance and/or best practice) undertaken by a suitably qualified person when submitting a planning application. The Phase 1 assessment should include information on past and current uses and a Conceptual Site Model of potential contaminants [(102)], pathways [(103)] and receptors. Assessments should include information on the extent, scale, nature and likely impact and risks of any contamination. If the potential for contamination is identified, a Phase 2 assessment will also need to accompany the planning application. 18.76 To remediate a contaminated land site, the significant contaminant linkages should be broken, so that no unacceptable risks remain or risks are reduced as far as practicable. 18.77 Responsibility for securing a safe development on sites affected by contamination rests with the landowner/ developer (NPPF paragraph 184). A precautionary approach will be followed whereby the burden of proof that a development on potentially contaminated land is not harmful lies with the landowner/ developer. Development proposals should not result in a hazard or hazards prejudicial to the future use of any energy generation site or to surrounding land. 18.78 Where mitigation measures are proposed, the Council needs to be convinced that the proposed measures will be effective with respect to human health, property, water bodies and the wider natural environment. The provision of these measures should be in place at an early stage of the development. For example, carefully designed SuDS could be used on sites on contaminated land instead of traditional piped systems.This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 57 'Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)'. 18.79 Planning permission should only be granted if the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Council that adequate and effective remedial measures to remove the potential harm to receptors will be implemented. Remediation measures may be secured by planning conditions. 18.80 The Council intends to prepare local contaminated land guidance; reference should be made to the guidance once available. 18.81 The above policy should be read in conjunction with Policy LP 58 'Pollution and hazards'. 102 A contaminant is a substance which is in, on or under the land and which has the potential to cause significant harm to a relevant receptor, or to cause significant pollution of controlled waters (Defra, 2012). 103 A pathway is a route by which a receptor is or might be affected by a contaminant (DEFRA, 2012). 298 KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (Chapter 11 Making effective use of land; Chapter 15 Conserving and enhancing the natural environment) PPG (Land affected by contamination) Land contamination: risk management (DEFRA and Environment Agency, April 2016) Environmental Protection Act 1990: Part 2A – Contaminated Land Statutory Guidance (DEFRA, April 2012) Model Procedures for the Management of Land Contamination.

This will include consideration of provision for non-car modes of transport and ensuring that highway safety and the operation of the highway network are not unacceptably harmed. This policy sets out the requirements for smaller developments requiring transport assessments and larger development using transport modelling. 19.2 The overall goal for future growth is to ensure people and goods can travel to their destinations using a variety of modes of transport. To do this we need to minimise the use of motor vehicles as much as possible. However, where journeys are essential to allow the movement of people and goods, a choice of modes of transport should be available. Development will cause transport impacts which will need to be assessed and where necessary, mitigated. Policy LP 26 'Transport infrastructure provision', Policy LP 25 'Transport principles', Policy LP 61 'Travel plans', and Policy LP 62 'Parking' set out the necessary mitigation requirements. 300 19.3 Any major development scheme must demonstrate that there are no severe residual transport impacts arising from a development proposal. This should be done through the submission of a Transport Assessment (TA) or Transport Statement (as advised by the Local Highway Authority), taking account of guidance from the Council which is set out in the Parking Standards Supplementary Planning Document. A TA will normally be supported by traffic modelling using a validated model which must comply with current Department of Transport criteria.The modelling should consider the transport impact of development without any mitigation to ascertain any residual impacts it would place on the highway network. Further testing should be undertaken with necessary mitigation measures to demonstrate that the proposal will not cause any significant transport impacts. 19.4 The TA should assess the individual and cumulative impacts of the development on the existing transport system and take account of impacts from other developments. It will also set out appropriate mitigation measures to address these identified impacts and show how highway safety has been addressed in the design of the development. It will explain how non-car modes of travel will be encouraged through the design of the transport network, the use of travel plans, financial contributions to off-site infrastructure or public transport or the provision of appropriate infrastructure for these modes within the development. 19.5 Relevant smaller developments will be required to submit a Transport Statement with their proposals. 19.6 Where advised by the Local Highways Authority, developments over 50 dwellings should use the Council’s validated model in support of their transport submissions.

The following policies provide the development management policy framework for both topics. Travel plans 19.8 In line with national guidance, the Council requires new development that is likely to have significant transport implications to implement travel plans. A travel plan sets out the process by which the development’s owner or occupier will promote sustainable travel choices and reduce the overall need for car travel. The Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document sets out the development thresholds above which a travel plan will be sought, and the associated fees to be charged by the Council. Each travel plan must be monitored by the owner or occupier for a minimum period of five years. As part of this requirement, annual reports will need to be submitted to the Council. A deposit will be held by the Council, to be returned to the developer or occupier, if after five years, the travel plan is successfully implemented. 19.9 For a major development, a developer may be required to pay an additional travel plan sum to the Council in lieu of providing a travel plan. The size of any payment will be proportional to the number of dwellings being built. In return, the Council will take responsibility for delivering 302 and monitoring the travel planning measures across the site, and in the wider Borough area. This option will ensure greater consistency of sustainable travel choices promoted across a wider area.

Therefore, this policy seeks to secure the provision of appropriate parking and servicing facilities, while ensuring that appropriate provision is made for more sustainable forms of transport such as cycle parking and charging points for electric vehicles where appropriate. 19.11 Whilst the Building Regulations (Part S) cover the provision of infrastructure for charging electric vehicles, there are still a number of situations where there is a need for some form of planning control. For example, this might be in deciding the location of charging points in sensitive areas such as conservation areas or where listed buildings are affected. Furthermore, the Council may wish to seek on street provision within the public highway. 19.12 All relevant proposals should have regard to the Council’s current Parking Standards Supplementary Planning Document which will be used as guidance in the determination of planning applications. Where robust evidence is provided and more sustainable transport modes are both available and accessible, parking provision can be considered more flexibly, but there should always be disabled parking provision and parking for cycles. There may be circumstances in some residential schemes where car-free elements or the provision of less parking than the relevant standard will be appropriate subject to detailed and robust evidence demonstrating why there is a reduced need for parking which might include the provision of car clubs and proximity to excellent public transport. Commercial development should also make adequate provision for lorry parking, turning, servicing and facilities for deliveries etc. Institutions such as schools and care homes need to provide parking for staff and visitors. 19.13 It is important that developments include safe and secure cycle parking which facilitates and encourages cycling as a mode of transport. Planning guidance for parking has been adopted by the Council. 304 KEY EVIDENCE NPPF (Chapter 9) PPG (Transport evidence bases in plan making decision taking - reference ID: 54-001 to 54-012 and Travel plans, transport assessments and statements reference ID: 42-001 to 42-011) The Local Transport Plan 3 Core Strategy and Implementation Plan 2011-26 (2011) DELIVERY Through the determination of planning applications Implementation of the Infrastructure Delivery Plan Section 106 Agreements and planning conditions Section 38/278 Agreements Collection and spend of CIL and/or other infrastructure funding mechanisms The statutory functions of the Local Highway Authority Implementation of the Local Transport Plan 3 (2011) and its related strategies. 305", "level": 1, "path": ["Part 2 - Non-Strategic Issues"], "tokens": 23410, "source": "APPENDIX A Bracknell Forest Local Plan for adoption"}

These individuals are referred to as ‘custom builders’ or ‘self builders’.This does not include the building of a house on a plot acquired from a person who builds the house wholly or mainly to plans or specifications decided or offered by that person. Whilst there is no legal differentiation between custom build and self build, self build generally means the occupiers take on an active role, procuring, designing and building their own home. They may outsource elements of the project, where their skills or time do not allow it.| |Sense of place|A way of describing an attractive place that is recognisably distinctive but simultaneously strengthens local identity.| |Sensitive uses|These include dwellings, hospitals, schools, nurseries, residential care and nursing homes.| |Sequential test|For flood risk, the sequential test ensures a sequential approach, which steers new development to areas with the lowest probability of flooding, is taken. Development should not be allocated or permitted if there are reasonably available sites appropriate for the proposed development in areas with a lower probability of flooding.The sequential approach should be used in areas known to be at risk now or in the future from any form of flooding. For main town centre uses, the sequential test ensures a sequential approach is taken when determining planning applications: main town centre uses should be located in centres, then in edge of centre locations; and only if suitable sites are not available (or expected to become available within a reasonable period) should out of centre sites be considered. When considering edge of centre and out of centre proposals, preference should be given to accessible sites which are well connected to the centre.| |Setting of a heritage asset|The surroundings in which a heritage asset is experienced. Its extent is not fixed and may change as the asset and its surroundings evolve. Elements of a setting may make a positive or negative contribution to the significance of an asset, may affect the ability to appreciate that significance or may be neutral.| |Shared Ownership|A form of intermediate affordable housing which is partly sold and partly rented to the occupiers, with a Registered Provider (normally a housing association) being the landlord. Shared ownership housing should normally offer a maximum initial share of 25% of the open market value of the dwelling.The annual rental charges on the unsold equity (share) should be no more than 2.75% of this share.| |Significance of a heritage asset|The value of a heritage asset to this and future generations because of its heritage interest. That interest may be archaeological, architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical presence, but also from its setting.| 392 |Site Allocations Local Plan (SALP)|The SALP was adopted in July 2013 to help implement the then adopted Core Strategy. Whilst the BFLP replaced the Core Strategy on adoption, some of the policies in the SALP are still relevant and have therefore been saved since it includes sites allocated for development that are still to be developed within the BFLP plan period.| ||| |Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)|Areas of special interest by reason of their flora, fauna, geological or physiological features. They are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. There are several within Bracknell Forest, which are defined on the Policies Map.| |Soft landscaping|Soft landscaping: landscaping consisting of planted vegetation including trees, shrubs hedges and lawns.| |Source Protection Zone (SPZ)|SPZs are areas identified by the Environment Agency to be at risk from potentially polluting activities, and often found around wells, boreholes and springs. They are designated for all groundwater supplies intended for human consumption.| |South East Plan (SEP)|The SEP sets out regional policy for the south east of England and was originally published in May 2009. It was partially revoked on 25th March 2013. Policy NRM6, which deals with the Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area (SPA), remains in place.| |Specialist housing|Housing that has been specifically designed to meet the needs of people with particular needs. It can refer to housing that has been purpose designed or designated for a particular client group to assist tenants to live independently.| |Special Area of Conservation (SAC)|These are sites of international importance, as defined in Regulation 8 of the Conservation of Species and Habitats Regulations 2017 (as amended). Within Bracknell Forest there is one SAC - Windsor Forest and Great Park.| |Special Protection Area (SPA)|A nature conservation area, as defined in Regulation 8 of the Conservation of Species and Habitats Regulations 2017 (as amended), designated in order to protect internationally important species of birds which live within them. Within Bracknell Forest there is one SPA – the Thames Basin Heaths SPA. SPAs are subject to the assessment procedure set out in the Habitats Regulations.| |Stepping stones|Pockets of habitat that, while not necessarily connected, facilitate the movement of species across otherwise inhospitable landscapes.| |Strategic Access Management and Monitoring (SAMM)|Overseen by Natural England and Hampshire County Council, this implements standard messages and additional wardening and education across the Thames Basin Heaths SPA.| |Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA)|A system of incorporating environmental considerations into policies, plans and programmes as required by the Environmental Assessment of Plans and Programmes Regulations 2004 (as amended). It is intended to highlight environmental issues during decision-making about strategic documents such as plans, programmes and strategies. The SEA identifies the significant environmental effects that are likely to result from implementing the plan or alternative approaches to the plan. SEA is often undertaken in conjunction with a Sustainability Appraisal (SA).| |Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA)|A strategic-level assessment of: the potential flood risk from all sources (taking climate change into account); the potential cumulative impact of development on flood risk, and; how flood risk should be managed should sites be allocated for development.| |Strategic Housing and Economic Land Availability Assessment (SHELAA)|An assessment that provides a list of sites/clusters which should be assessed for consideration as allocations. It establishes realistic assumptions about the availability, suitability and likely economic viability of land to meet the identified need for housing and economic development over the plan period. As a result, it forms part of the evidence base for making decisions about which sites (if required) should be allocated both in and outside settlements. Therefore the SHELAA does not allocate sites for development; rather, it informs the preparation of development plan documents.| |Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA)|The SHMA (2016) was a study which assessed Berkshire and S. Bucks’ full housing needs. In order to achieve this, it: identified where strong functional relationships between Boroughs were present, in order to define Housing Market Areas (HMAs), and; assessed projected population growth against the characteristics of households and dwellings are to identify the Objectively Assessed Need for housing for each HMA, and the need for different types of housing (including affordable) and those of particular groups (older people, students etc) are. With the exception of the work on the HMA’s this document has essentially been replaced with the Bracknell Forest Housing Needs Assessment 2021.| |Strategic Suitable Alternative Natural Greenspace (SANG)|Strategic SANGs are open spaces in Bracknell Forest which, in agreement with NE, have been identified as being suitable for bringing up to SANGs standard through the application of developer contributions.| 393 |Suitable Alternative Natural Green Space (SANG)|Open space, meeting guidelines on quantity and quality, for the purpose of providing recreational alternatives to divert dogwalkers and others from the Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area (SPA). It is provided by residential developments lying within a certain distance from the SPA to avoid those developments creating additional recreational pressure on it.| ||| |Supplementary Planning Document (SPD)|A document which adds further detail to the policies in the development plan. SPDs can be used to provide further guidance for development on specific sites, or on particular issues, such as design. They are capable of being a material consideration in planning decisions but are not part of the development plan.| |Sustainability Appraisal (SA)|A process that examines the impact of proposed plans and policies on economic, social and environmental factors, and ensures that these issues are taken into account at every stage so that sustainable development is delivered on the ground. It also appraises the different options that are put forward in the development of policies and the identification of sites. Each local plan that the Council produces is accompanied by its own SA, which also incorporates the requirement of SEA.| |Sustainable development|This broadly is development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The purpose of the planning system is to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development.| |Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)|These are sustainable engineering solutions which are adopted to deal with increased surface water in urban areas by mimicking the normal water cycle in natural landscapes. This is opposed to more traditional methods which just involved re-routing surface water to watercourses.Techniques utilised in SuDS include facilitating increased water infiltration into the earth as well as increased evaporation of surface water and transpiration from vegetation (collectively called evapotranspiration) to decrease the amount of surface water run-off. SuDS take account of water quantity, water quality, biodiversity and amenity issues.| |Sustainable transport|Transport modes that minimise harmful effects on the environment and depletion of natural resources and hence can be sustained in the long term. Includes walking, cycling, low and ultra low emissions vehicles, car sharing and fuel-efficient public transport.| |Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area (TBHSPA)|A nature conservation area in Berkshire, Hampshire and Surrey, as defined in Regulation 8 of the Conservation of Species and Habitats Regulations 2017 (as amended), comprising a group of heathland sites in order to protect internationally important species of birds which live within them. The TBHSPA is subject to the assessment procedure set out in the Habitats Regulations.| |Tiny forest|Tiny Forests are densely packed native trees that fit into an area the size of a tennis court. They can provide significant biodiversity benefits (including species-rich ecosystems), carbon capture and visual amenity in areas where open space is limited.| |Townscape|The appearance of a town or city; an urban scene.| |Transit site / transit pitches|A traveller site that is intended for short-term accommodation while in transit. The site is usually permanent and authorised, but there is a limit on the length of time residents can stay.| |Transport Assessment / Transport Accessibility Assessment (TA)|Assessment that analyses the transport issues relating to a proposed development and identifies what measures can be taken to deal with the anticipated transport impacts of the scheme. It also looks at ways of improving accessibility and safety for all modes of travel, including alternatives to the car such as walking, cycling and public transport. Transport statements also assess the transport implications of development and are used when developments are anticipated to have limited transport impacts.| |Transport statement|A simplified version of a transport assessment where it is agreed the transport issues arising from development proposals are limited and a full transport assessment is not required.| |Travel plan|Sets out the process by which the development’s owner or occupier will promote sustainable travel choices and reduce the overall need for car travel.| |Travelling showpeople|Members of a group organised for the purposes of holding fairs, circuses or shows (whether or not travelling together as such). This includes such persons who on the grounds of their own or their family’s or dependants’ more localised pattern of trading, educational or health needs or old age have ceased to travel temporarily or permanently, but excludes Gypsies and travellers as defined above.| |Tree Preservation Order (TPO)|TPOs protect specific trees, groups of trees or woodlands in the interests of amenity. The cutting down, topping, lopping, uprooting or willful damage or destruction of trees which are the subject of a TPO is prohibited unless written consent is given by the LPA.| |Urban cooling and shading|The reduction of the 'Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect' through the incorporation of green and blue infrastructure in urban areas. UHIs are urban areas that are noticeably hotter than surrounding areas due to human activity (including emissions), reduced levels of vegetation and use of manmade surfaces that absorb heat during the day and emit heat at night. Studies show that incorporation of green and blue infrastructure can result in urban cooling and urban shading, reducing the impact of UHIs and global warming.| 394 |Urban creep allowance|Urban creep is the reduction of permeable land within urban areas, normally caused by the paving of garden areas and erection of extensions, which leads to reduced infiltration, increased surface water run-off and greater flood risk. These changes are often outside of the development management process and therefore are not normally controlled. For this reason, the Council’s Local Flood Risk Management Strategy sets out allowances for urban creep to be used when assessing development proposals.| ||| |Veteran tree|A tree that is of interest biologically, culturally or aesthetically because of its age, size or condition.| |Wildlife corridor|Areas of habitat connecting wildlife populations.| |Windfall allowance|The predicted number of dwellings that may come forward each year on sites that have not been identified through the Local Plan process. Normally relates to previously developed sites in settlements.| |Windfall sites|Also referred to as ‘windfalls’, these are sites which have not been specifically identified in the Development Plan. They normally comprise previously developed sites that have unexpectedly become available.| |Windsor Forest and Great Park Special Area of Conservation|A nature conservation area, as defined in Regulation 8 of the Conservation of Species and Habitats Regulations 2017 (as amended), predominantly comprising mixed woodland designated for its beech forests, oak woods and the violet click beetle (and subject to the assessment procedure set out in the Habitats Directive), in order to protect these internationally important habitats and species. SACs are subject to the assessment procedure set out in the Habitats Regulations.| |Yard|Travelling showpeople travel in connection with their work and therefore live, almost universally, in wagons. During the winter months these are parked up in what was traditionally known as ‘winter quarters’. These ‘yards’ are now often occupied all year around by some family members.| 395", "level": 2, "path": ["Appendices", "Appendix 8: Glossary"], "tokens": 9241, "source": "APPENDIX A Bracknell Forest Local Plan for adoption"}

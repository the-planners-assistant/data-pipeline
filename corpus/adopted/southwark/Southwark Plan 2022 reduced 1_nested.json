Our planning policies and area visions are designed to help us achieve wider objectives in Southwark – a reduction in inequality, a means to tackle the climate emergency, and to support an economy that provides new jobs and works for everyone. The pressing need for genuinely affordable housing, is the pre-eminent theme that has underpinned the development of policies in this Southwark Plan. In particular the council has identified and evidenced a huge demand for council housing and other homes available at social rent. This has informed our own council house-building programme, with 2,500 homes due to be delivered or on-site by May 2022, and it is why we will continue to challenge any developer who wants to build in Southwark, to go further, beyond the 35% requirement, in their own plans and provision. Emerging from the COVID pandemic, and conscious of the Climate and Ecological Emergency, we are aware more than ever of the need for good quality parks and open spaces, for the benefit of the environment and for our own mental health and wellbeing. This Plan sets out our vision for an enhanced natural environment, with 11 hectares of new designated open space, 22 new sites of importance for nature conservation, and a requirement for Biodiversity Net Gain in all new developments. We include stretching targets for the reduction of on-site carbon emissions, and to reflect the Council’s ambition to be a carbon neutral borough by 2030, we will be bringing forward an early review of the plan, to further strengthen policy in this area. Over the next 15 years, we hope to create 58,000 new jobs through opportunities generated by the Southwark Plan, many of which we hope will be good quality, decent green jobs. Initiatives like the Construction Skills Centre, supporting work at the Elephant & Castle, and now at Canada Water, underline our commitment to bring opportunities to local young people and the Plan also establishes our Affordable Workspace Policy. In order to bring key policies together under the Southwark Plan 2022, this document includes Area Visions for the Aylesbury, Peckham and Nunhead, and Canada Water, which were previously addressed in Area Action Plans which will now be rescinded. The next iteration of the Old Kent Road Area Action Plan (AAP) will follow the adoption of the Southwark Plan, and will set out our refreshed vision for new homes, jobs and parks in that part of our borough. Over the years, Southwark has undergone dramatic changes, and those changes in the built environment can sometimes feel unsettling. However, they have also delivered new leisure centres, parks, health centres, cultural venues and youth centres, and transformed our public realm with greening, art, and routes for walking and cycling. We are committed as a council to ensuring that we support residents and businesses through change, and to securing change that delivers real positive benefits and social value for everyone in our borough. 27 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Purpose and contents of the Plan 1. Southwark Council is at the forefront of planning and regeneration for all to improve and protect all of the different areas for everyone within the borough. The purpose of the Southwark Plan 2022 is to set out how the areas will develop and the policies which will guide new developments. 2. Planning decisions must be made in accordance with the policies set out in the development plan unless other material considerations indicate otherwise. This will include the Southwark Plan 2022, the London Plan, adopted Area Action Plans and adopted Neighbourhood Plans. The council will also take into account Supplementary Planning Documents which provide more detailed guidance with additional requirements or other material considerations such as Conservation Area Appraisals and Conservation Area Management Plans. The Southwark Plan 2022 and Monitoring Framework has replaced the Core Strategy (2011) saved Southwark Plan (2013) policies, Aylesbury Area Action Plan (2010), Peckham and Nunhead Area Action Plan (2014) and Canada Water Area Action Plan (2015) including their monitoring frameworks. The list of policies and sites from the AAP’s that the Southwark Plan 2022 has replaced is contained in Annex 5. 3. The Southwark Plan 2022 has to be in general conformity with the adopted London Plan and must be consistent with the National Planning Policy Framework. 4. There is a Community Infrastructure Levy document which sets out the payments required for developments. 5. For the most up to date documents related to Southwark’s planning policy, please see the diagram below and [check the website: www.southwark.gov.uk/planningpolicy](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/planningpolicy) 28 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Figure 1.

Southwark is a densely populated and diverse inner London borough with a young, growing and mobile population in a patchwork of diverse communities and places with distinct identities. Our residents can benefit from the vibrancy of our cultures and communities that have developed from a series of villages that are now town centres. Southwark is situated on the south bank of the River Thames with the City and Westminster to the north, Lambeth to the west, Greenwich and Lewisham to the east and Bromley, Bexley to the south. We have set out unique visions for all of our very different successful places. 2. Southwark has a very mobile population with 10% of people moving in and 10% moving out each year. Southwark has a much younger population than London or the national average. These are young adults in their 20s and 30s rather than a large number of children or young people. Southwark is a diverse borough with people from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. Over 120 languages are spoken here and 11% of households have no family members who have English as a first language. Just over half (54%) of Southwark’s population is of white ethnicity, a quarter (25%) are black and a third are Asian (11%) or other (10%) ethnicities. This is different from the rest of London where a considerably smaller proportion identify as black (13%) and a larger proportion identify as Asian (21%). There are far more young people who are ethnically more diverse than other ages. 3. Southwark is growing much faster than the national average and has the second highest growth in South East London behind Greenwich. The population has increased from 256,700 people in 2001 to 314,200 people today. Since 2001 there has been growth across all age groups except those 70 to 84. Southwark’s population is expected to increase growing by 20% by 2030. This will mainly be in the north where there are new developments in Canada Water, Elephant and Castle and on the Old Kent Road and there will be a small decline in the population of communities in the south of the borough. 4. With regards to indices of deprivation, Southwark has seen an improvement in its ranking compared to other local authorities in England. The borough remains one of the most deprived in the country. Southwark is ranked in the bottom quartile of local authorities in England for both the average ranked score and the average score measure. Out of 317 local authorities in England (1st being most deprived), Southwark has ranked 40th in 2015 and 72nd in 2019 for the extent of deprivation when considering the average score which considers the average level of deprivation across the borough, based on the scores of all the neighbourhoods within it. 5. Despite Southwark’s ranking for deprivation improving in most areas since 2015, high levels of deprivation remain particularly relating to barriers to housing and the outdoor environment. 30 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 6. The indices of deprivation comprise: - Barriers to housing and services - Education skills and training - Employment - Income - Health & disability - Living environment - Crime 7. The relevant indices are detailed within the reasons of the strategic policies which seek to help to address deprivation witin the borough. 8. We need to make sure that our planning policies and local services are developed for our changing population. There needs to be capacity for homes, jobs and services for people who need them as a mobile population. 31 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 32 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Southwark Plan 2022 Strategy The Southwark Plan 2022 contains six types of policies: 1. Area Visions: Area Visions are policies that provide the strategic vision for the future of Southwark’s distinct places and neighbourhoods. They set out infrastructure improvements, opportunities for improved public spaces, transport improvements and growth opportunities for new homes and jobs. Area Visions also identify the character of different places to be renewed, retained or enhanced. Development proposals should be prepared in the context of the relevant Area Vision and should demonstrate how they contribute towards the strategic vision for that area. 2. Strategic policies: Strategic policies ST1, ST2, SP1, SP2, SP3, SP4, SP5 and SP6 are borough-wide policies which set out the council’s ` regeneration strategy to work with local people to improve neighbourhoods and create new opportunities for the future. They are also used to set the context for our detailed planning policies and to make planning decisions. Neighbourhood Plans prepared must be in general conformity with the strategic policies of the Southwark Plan 2022. 3. Development management policies: Development management policies set out further detail which is required to deliver the strategic policies.They are used to assess planning applications. 4. Implementation policies: Implementation policies set out how the council will implement the Southwark Plan 2022 as the council’s primary planning and regeneration strategy, alongside the policies in our wider Development Plan, including our Area Action Plans, the London Plan and any neighbourhood plans. 5. Site Allocations: Site Allocations are planning policies which apply to key potential development sites of strategic importance. Site Allocations are needed to ensure that when a strategic site comes forward for redevelopment it integrates well into its surroundings and contributes towards meeting strategic needs for new homes, jobs, public open space, public access routes, transport infrastructure and social infrastructure, such as health or education facilities. Site Allocations set out the land uses that must be provided as part of any redevelopment alongside other acceptable land uses that may be provided in addition to the required land uses. Site Allocations are not required for sites which are likely to be redeveloped in line with the development management policies of the Southwark Plan 2022. 6. Planning Policies Map: Some planning policies only apply in defined areas, for example, conservation areas. The Planning Policies Map shows planning designations where specific planning policies must be applied. 33 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Strategic Targets Providing quality social rented and intermediate homes - Aim to deliver at least 2,355 new homes every year. - 11,000 new council homes will be delivered by 2043 as part of the overall housing target. - Aim to deliver 50% of all new homes as social rented and intermediate homes, with a minimum requirement of 35% (25% social rented and 10% intermediate) in planning applications.

The Southwark Plan 2022 Vision is for Southwark to continue to be a network of successful, unique, historic, distinct places with affordable housing and business space, plenty of shops and cultural activities, open spaces and clean air that are linked together, to Central and the rest of London by an accessible and affordable transport network looking forward to 2036. 2. Southwark is a place which is resilient to the impacts of climate change where net carbon emissions will be zero. Southwark has exemplary neighbourhoods for families to live and delivers an excellent range of quality public and private open spaces. We want the new neighbourhoods we will deliver to be places where we and our children will want to live and which we can be rightly proud. We will provide new local opportunities for shopping and employment and create a green and inclusive economy. 3. Southwark contains Central London destinations such as London Bridge, Bankside, Canada Water, Elephant and Castle and Old Kent Road. These historic and unique destinations are residential areas woven in with attractions for millions of visitors, National and International headquarters, office space for small businesses, shops, homes, schools, community and leisure activities. These Opportunity and Action Areas are linked to Central London and the rest of London by tube, train, bus, cycle and walking with well preserved open spaces and green links to provide places for activities and to address the Climate Emergency. 4. Town Centres such as Peckham, Camberwell and Lordship Lane provide distinct and diverse shops, services, arts and cultural activities with very large catchment areas due to the specialist goods and services. They are surrounded by residential communities that benefit from the busy, diverse town centres. 5. Residential communities in the south such as Bermondsey, Nunhead, East Dulwich, Herne Hill, Dulwich Village and West Dulwich are historic areas with unique local characteristics and great shops, services and other activities in local centres. 6. Local Area Visions are set out in section 8 with detailed information about how each area is expected to develop. 44 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents ST1 Southwark’s Development Targets 1. Development will improve the places in Southwark to enable a better quality of life for Southwark’s diverse population. It must contribute to our Strategic Vision, Local Area Visions, Strategic Policies, Development Management Policies and Implementation Policies to protect, enhance and regenerate our places. This will ensure the borough continues to be successful, diverse and vibrant. We will work with our partners, local communities and developers to ensure that developments deliver the required growth and improvements to achieve our targets including: 1. 40,035 homes between 2019 and 2036 (2,355 new homes per annum), this includes 10,217 homes on small sites between 2019 and 2036 (601 new homes per annum). 2. 11,000 council homes will be delivered by 2043 as part of the overall housing target. 3. 58,000 total jobs between 2019 and 2036 including at least 1,000 new green jobs through the Southwark Green New Deal. The targets for the distribution of jobs are: |Borough, Bankside and London Bridge Opportunity Area|10,000| ||| |Elephant and Castle Opportunity Area|10,000| |Canada Water Opportunity Area|20,000| |Old Kent Road Opportunity Area|10,000| |Other town centres|8,000| 4. 460,000 sqm office floorspace between 2019 and 2036 (equating to around 35,500 jobs). Around 80% of new offices will be delivered in the Central Activities Zone. Additional offices will be delivered in the Canada Water and Old Kent Road Opportunity Areas and in town centres; 5. 90,000sqm additional employment floorspace between 2019 and 2036 outside the CAZ including industrial, distribution, hybrid and studio workspace; 6. 76,670 sqm net new retail floorspace between 2019 and 2036 6,560sqm convenience retail, |42,130sqm comparison goods retail, 27,980sqm of the retail floorspace are:|food and beverage).

The growth of other activities that create successful places such as places to work, leisure, arts and culture, sports, schools, health centres and tourist activities. We will encourage developments to focus on the strengths of places that make the different areas of the borough distinctive and respect and integrate with the local and historic context and communities. 8. The location and design of new development contributing to securing our targets of carbon neutrality by 2030 and net zero carbon by 2050; 9. Increase the provision of open space in the borough by requiring the provision of 11 hectares of new open space as identified in site allocations along with the designation of MOL, BOL and OOS as identified on the Policies Map. Reasons 1. Southwark’s spatial strategy is to continue with regeneration and preservation to create destinations, town centres and residential communities that preserve and enhance the history of places particularly historical buildings and open spaces. With desirable environments, affordable housing, business space, shops and activities where there are jobs for residents as well as the business headquarters, utilising technology and building transport infrastructure to improve air quality and tackle the Climate Emergency. This new development must provide housing of all tenures for all age groups to integrate with existing communities and improve places for existing residents and businesses particularly in the areas around where the new development is being built. The local facilities, transport network, network of open spaces and infrastructure will support the fast pace of change in the Action and Opportunity Areas such as Aylesbury, Bankside, Borough, London Bridge, Elephant and Castle, Old Kent Road and Peckham. 46 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Southwark’s Places ST2 1. Our spatial strategy is to strengthen the distinctive network of diverse places so that they will continue to be successful and vibrant as part of the overall plan for Southwark as set out in the Strategic and Area Visions and Strategic Targets Policy between 2019 and 2036. We are doing this by maximising our opportunities using spatial planning. We set out how we will achieve this through our strategic policies, development management policies, implementation policies, delivery programmes and monitoring. 2. This complex place making process is continuous and needs to involve the diverse range of people who use it to be meaningful in creating places that people find successful to live in and visit. Collectively we need to work together to improve each place through tackling the challenges and maximising our strengths. 3. Most new development will happen in the Opportunity Areas and Action Area Cores (Bankside, Borough and London Bridge, Elephant and Castle, Aylesbury, Canada Water, Camberwell, Old Kent Road, Peckham and Nunhead). We are aiming to balance delivering as many homes as possible with providing jobs, protecting industrial and office locations, continuing with vibrant town centres, protection of open space and historic characteristics. 4. We will work with our partners, local communities and developers to ensure that developments improve our places for local communities through delivery of regeneration in our Opportunity and Action Areas to achieve our targets.

The capacities planned for Rotherhithe are based on the average of residential unit range set out in the Canada Water masterplan (Site allocation NSP78). * The change was due to a redevelopment to provide a new stadium at Dulwich Hamlet Football Club **** The housing capacity for Old Kent Road is to be phased, including 9,500 homes in Phase 1, with the phasing plan to be determined through the Old Kent Road Area Action Plan 49 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Our different areas 50 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Homes for all SP1 We will lead the way in London to build more homes of every kind in Southwark and to use every tool at our disposal to increase the supply of all different kinds of homes. Our target is for 50% of all new homes as social rented and intermediate homes. We will ensure that all new homes in Southwark are of such good quality that you will not know whether you are visiting homes in private, housing association or council ownership. This will be achieved through: 1. Delivering at least 40,035 homes between 2019 and 2036 (2,355 new homes per annum), this includes 10,217 homes on small sites between 2019 and 2036 (601 new homes per annum); and 2. Supporting the delivery of homes on small sites; and 3. Building 11,000 new council homes by 2043 as part of our overall housing target, by developing our own land and developing on some of our existing estates, including in-fill development; and 4. Encouraging developers to increase the provision of social rented and intermediate homes on sites beyond 35%; and 5. Encouraging developers to receive affordable housing grant to increase the provision of social rented and intermediate housing; and 6. Encouraging developers to provide more social rented and intermediate housing through the fast track route; and 7. Maintaining high housing standards; and 8. Building more family homes for households with children as well as childless households; and 9. Ensuring that vulnerable residents and families are helped to find the right housing to live as independently as possible; and 10. Enabling our residents to take pride in and feel responsible for their homes and local area; and 11. Requiring sustainable design so that new homes adapt to climate change and mitigate against climate change by reducing carbon emissions on site. Reasons 1. We will continue to deliver one of the highest levels of new homes nationally in Southwark. We are building on average around 42% gross and 33% net affordable homes per year. This equates to 9,200 gross new affordable homes and 6,416 net affordable homes between 2004-2019. We will increase this to 50% social rented and intermediate homes in line with the London Plan through our new council homes delivery programme and encouraging developers to exceed 35% social rented and intermediate homes delivery. This will seek to address the need for affordable housing in the borough identified in the Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2019) of 2,077 affordable homes per annum which equates to 35,309 homes over the plan period between 2019 and 2036. 2. The Housing Trajectory is illustrated below and detailed further at Annex 2. This sets out an annualised trajectory of homes to be delivered over the plan period to demonstrate that there is a sufficient supply of homes coming forward to meet our housing target, including recent under-delivery in 2019/20 and a 20% 51 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents buffer over the first five years. The supply is coming forward through a pipeline of planning permissions, site allocations within the Southwark Plan 2022 and the delivery of new council homes on the council’s own land. It identifies sufficient deliverable sites in the first five years and developable sites in years 6 to 15 based on the latest evidence in the 5 and 15 Year Housing Land Supply Report. The council will publish an annual update of this. 3. We need to build and facilitate delivery of a variety of new homes that meet the needs of households of different sizes, on different incomes and with a variety of specific needs. We will encourage innovative solutions to meeting specific housing needs where suited to the local context. For example, we will support residents who wish to build their own homes where the proposed development is using land efficiently. We will not support live-work units where they would compromise employment uses or where conventional housing could be built. We will not permit Starter Homes on sites with viable commercial uses or on sites which are allocated for housing or on which conventional affordable housing would be acceptable under the policies of this Plan. 4. In Southwark around 1,860 gross and 1,560 net new homes have been built annually between 2004 and 2019 with around 613 gross and 430 net new affordable homes. This is consistently one of the highest levels of delivery of new homes within London and nationwide. It is widely recognised that rising rent and property prices in the private sector, the loss of council homes through the ‘Right to Buy’, and a lack of affordable housing means that younger generations may be forced to move away from their families and communities. Our residents told us they want more council housing and that it should be of a high standard, we are tackling this by building 11,000 new council homes by 2043. 5. We identify in the site allocations enough land to build 2,355 net additional homes per year to meet our target. 6. There are high levels of deprivation relating to barriers to housing and services across Southwark, this measures the physical and financial accessibility of housing and local services. Over three quarters of residents live in communities ranked in the 20% most deprived in England. This covers a significant part of the borough. When looking at the sub-domain that focuses on housing affordability, overcrowding, and homelessness 97% of our residents live in the 20% most deprived communities in England. 7. It is important homes can adapt to climate change through design to minimise the impacts of climate change on local residents. In the design process, carbon emission reduction on site for residential development is required to meet net carbon zero for major development. 52 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Indicative Southwark Plan 2022 housing trajectory (2020-2035) 53 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Housing Trajectory - source of supply by year 54 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents SP2 Southwark Together We will continue to revitalise our places and neighbourhoods to create new opportunities for residents and local businesses, to promote wellbeing and reduce inequalities so that people have better lives in stronger communi-­ ties. This will be achieved through: 1. Mitigating and adapting development to climate change to meet the net zero carbon target by 2050; and 2. Developing places where everyone can benefit from all activities, including play spaces, leisure activities, squares and shops, buildings and the natural environment. These places should enable everyone to feel proud of their home and create a sense of belonging in the community; and 3. Investing in our communities and residents, and particularly existing residents, so that everyone can access the benefits of our regeneration programmes and the opportunities created by those programmes for new homes, new jobs, education, training and new physical and social infrastructure; and 4. Encouraging greater tenure integration and equality within and between new development in order to create the conditions for properly mixed and integrated communities, ensuring equity of esteem from street level, and to mitigate against stark visible differences and a sense of tenure segregation; and 5. Developments being designed for the diverse communities in Southwark, including all principles of the Southwark Stands Together initiative and to ensure accessibility, inclusivity, and interaction, regardless of disability, age, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, pregnancy and maternity, marriage or civil partnership or gender, and allow all to participate equally, confidently and independently in everyday activities; and 6. Making our neighbourhoods safer with well-designed buildings and spaces that mitigate and minimise the impacts of climate change on local residents, discourage crime and anti-social behaviour and foster a sense of community; and 7. Encouraging residential development above shops to enliven town centres; and 8. Ensuring that our existing residents and neighbourhoods prosper from good growth by giving people from every community the opportunity to collaborate throughout the regeneration process. Good growth includes supporting and diversifying our strong local economy, providing new jobs including new green jobs, championing existing and new business growth and supporting small shops and businesses through regeneration including building new, affordable workspaces to continue trading or grow their businesses; and 9. Enhancing local distinctiveness and heritage-led regeneration by requiring the highest possible standards of design, creating vibrant, attractive, healthy, safe and distinctive buildings and places that instil pride of place in all our communities. This will include networks of green infrastructure, opportunities for healthy activities and improving streets, squares and public places between buildings; and 10. Strengthening support in regeneration areas for those who are vulnerable or who face greater disadvantage, by investing in the prevention and tackling causes of inequality, involving all of our services, partners and community-based activities. 55 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Reasons 1. A Climate Emergency was declared by Southwark in March 2019. Adapting to and mitigating against climate change is important to reduce fuel poverty and address the unequal effects of climate change, particularly on our most vulnerable communities. 2. Southwark is committed to making regeneration that works for all. We are a borough with diverse communities, a proud heritage and a great future filled with potential, with some of the most exciting and ambitious regeneration programmes in the country being delivered right on our doorstep. The Southwark Plan 2022 explains the strategy for regeneration from 2019 to 2036 and promotes a more systematic approach to social regeneration, where wellbeing becomes the most important outcome of our regeneration efforts. Using our unique location in central London to benefit existing local residents, it will encourage innovative development of spaces to provide new council and social rented and intermediate homes, as well as jobs, schools, shops and places to work. 3. Southwark Stands Together is a borough wide initiative in response to the killing of George Floyd in 2020, the injustice and racism experienced by Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities and to the inequalities exposed by COVID-19. Southwark Stands Together is about all organisations, community groups and individuals across the borough committing to identify, and then implement solutions to address entrenched racism and injustice and take positive action to ensure equality of opportunity. 4. Homes are being built rapidly, with most of the change taking place in the north and centre of Southwark, predominantly in Elephant and Castle, Canada Water, Old Kent Road, Blackfriars Road, Bankside and along the River Thames. We need to keep up with this pace of change by ensuring that all of these places have infrastructure and services to make them function effectively for all members of our community. We need to make sure that as this change is taking place, by working in partnership with existing local residents and businesses and ensure that they are listened to at all times. The places created should be for existing residents and businesses as well as newcomers. 5. Our social regeneration framework outlines our ambitions of life opportunities, good health and wellbeing and pride of place for all, investing in communities and reducing inequalities. This framework will be implemented through social regeneration charters for the different areas in the borough. These will outline how we will achieve our ambitions at a local level and demonstrate how we will collaborate with the community throughout the process. Our approach to engagement includes the principles of transparency, engagement that is built on trust and ensuring our responses are timely and responsive to local views. 56 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Sports pitches at Brimmington Park 57 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents SP3 A great start in life We will give all our young people a great start in life in a safe, stable and healthy environment where they have the opportunity to develop, make choices and feel in control of their lives and future. This will be achieved through: 1. Offering our young people and families, including those who are more vulnerable or have special educational needs, the right support at the right time, from their early years through adolescence and into successful adult life; and 2. Delivering more childcare, school places and double the number of Southwark Scholarships; and 3. Delivering a top quality children’s playground in every local area; and 4. Providing free healthy school meals for primary schools and nurseries; and 5. Investing in more early support for families; and 6. Increasing library access; and 7. Finding new ways to guarantee care and early education to help parents; and 8. Encouraging developments where there can be more interaction between people of different ages, particularly elderly and young people; and: 9. Ensure our residents and schools benefit from the digital revolution including improving access to superfast broadband. Reasons 1. We believe in giving all our young people the best start in life and creating a family friendly borough which is the first choice for parents and carers to bring up their children. We will work with our looked after children to find them stable and loving homes. In our schools, the high demand for new primary and secondary places means we will make sure there are enough places for all. We will always aim to have the best for our children. 2. Southwark is ranked more favourably for education, skills and training, when measuring the lack of attainment and skills in the local population, including adults and children. While the most deprived areas in the borough are concentrated in central and northern areas, the level of deprivation relating to education, skills and training is much lower than other domains. Consultation event at a local school 58 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents SP4 A green and inclusive economy We will work to make sure that Southwark has a strong, green and inclusive economy where all of our existing and new residents, businesses and workers benefit. This will be achieved through: 1. Supporting a green new deal for Southwark that creates at least 1,000 new green jobs, cuts greenhouse gas emissions and generates a new wave of environmental innovation. Workplaces and town centres will be easily accessible by walking and cycling; and 2. Delivering at least 460,000sqm of new office space between 2019 and 2036 (equating to around 35,500 jobs). Around 80% of new offices will be delivered in the Central Activities Zone. Additional offices will be delivered in the Canada Water and Old Kent Road Opportunity Areas and in town centres; 3. Delivering at least 90,000sqm additional employment floorspace between 2019 and 2036 outside the CAZ including industrial, distribution, hybrid and studio workspace; and 4. Delivering at least 10% of all new employment floorspace as affordable workspace for start-ups and existing and new small and independent businesses in Southwark; and 5. Providing at least 58,000 new jobs between 2019 and 2036. The targets for the distribution of jobs are: |Borough, Bankside and London Bridge Opportunity Area|10,000| ||| |Elephant and Castle Opportunity Area|10,000| |Canada Water Opportunity Area|20,000| |Old Kent Road Opportunity Area|10,000| |Other town centres|8,000| 6. Bringing more opportunities for people to find work, get into training and achieve their aspirations; and 7. Making Southwark a place where the town centres and high streets thrive and are a place to do business in the London and global economy, where business owners know this is the borough where their enterprises will grow and prosper; and 8. Ensuring the distinctive town and local centres will be places where shops, leisure, office and community uses are competitive and popular, providing customer choice for local communities; and 9. Increasing retail floorspace by 76,670 sqm between 2019 and 2036 (6,560sqm convenience retail, 42,130sqm comparison goods retail, 27,980sqm food and beverage). The targets for the distribution of the retail floorspace are: |Elephant and Castle Major Town Centre|10,000sqm| ||| |Peckham Major Town Centre|7,000sqm| 59 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents |Canada Water Major Town Centre|40,000sqm| ||| |CAZ and district and local town centres|19,670sqm| 11. Working with our residents to assist them to be and stay financially independent; and 12. As shown on the policies map, designating 32ha of Strategic Protected Industrial Land where industrial uses will be maintained and designating 20ha of Locally Significant Industrial Sites where industrial premises will be co-located with new homes; and 13. Working with local business and other partners to make sure our residents are equipped with the skills and knowledge to access the many exciting opportunities that being in Southwark brings. Reasons 1. When our economy is strong then all of our residents benefit. It brings more opportunities for people in Southwark to find work, get into training and achieve their aspirations. Southwark has a network of employment clusters offering an environment where businesses, including small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), create new jobs and opportunities particularly for local people. To help provide more affordable business space and help start-up businesses our grant funds initiatives such as the High Street Challenge and the Southwark Pioneers Fund help to support business and community led groups to deliver new street markets and diversify uses on high streets through ‘pop-up’ uses on vacant and empty spaces. We pay particular attention to proposed growth in betting, pay-day loan shops and takeaways and the potential loss of pubs, leisure and cultural uses. There are plans to enhance and renew Old Kent Road, Canada Water, Peckham, Elephant and Castle, Camberwell, Tower Bridge Road and other town centres. Southwark is also home to some of the oldest and most established Business Improvement Districts in the country, helping to offer services and improvements for businesses and residents in Bankside, Bermondsey, the South Bank, London Bridge and Waterloo. 2. We will encourage the creation of green jobs as they contribute to enhancing, preserving or restoring the environment. This may include manufacturing, construction and emerging green sectors such as renewable energy and energy efficiency. 3. Southwark is projected to need to deliver 460,000sqm of new office space from 2019 to 2036. Along with other types of employment space this will provide 58,000 new jobs. Many of these will be in the Central Activities Zone and across our major opportunity areas including Canada Water and Old Kent Road. To meet the growing need for affordable workspace the plan includes a bespoke policy and strategic target of at least 10% of all new employment floorspace to be affordable workspace. Additionally Southwark has over 800 railway arches many of which will be made available to enliven the Low Line walking routes and provide small business space. Industrial space will be intensified in standalone and mixed use development and 52 60 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents hectares of land is retained for industrial uses or industrial mixed use development in the borough. 4. Southwark has a strong hierarchy of town centres which are projected to increase by 76,670 sqm retail floorspace between 2019 and 2036 (6,560sqm convenience retail, 42,130sqm comparison goods retail, 27,980sqm food and beverage). Growth of retail will mainly be accommodated in the redevelopment of three large shopping centres within the major town centres of Elephant and Castle, Peckham and Canada Water. Old Kent Road will also be transformed from retail warehouses with large car parks to a Healthy High Street. 5. Income deprivation measures the proportion of the population experiencing deprivation relating to low income, including those in and out of work. The most income deprived areas of the borough are located across central and northern Southwark. Almost a third of residents live in communities ranked in the 20% most income deprived in England. In contrast, 8% live in communities ranked in the 20% least income deprived these include Dulwich Village, a small part of Chaucer, Rotherhithe, North Bermondsey and Surrey Docks. 6. In terms of employment more specifically, the most employment deprived areas of the borough are located across central and northern Southwark, this includes part of the Old Kent Road, Peckham, Faraday, Newington and Camberwell Green. This measures the proportion of the working age population in an area involuntary excluded from the labour market. Almost 14% of residents live in communities ranked in the 20% most employment deprived in England. In contrast, almost 12% live in communities ranked in the 20% least employment deprived. 61 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents SP5 Thriving neighbourhoods and tackling health inequalities We will maintain and improve the health and wellbeing of our residents, encouraging healthy lives by tackling the causes of ill health and inequalities. This will be achieved by: 1. Ensuring all council homes are warm, dry and safe; and 2. Building quality new homes to help people to live healthier lives; and 3. Working with residents and our partners to build resilient communities; and 4. Extending opportunities to all to maintain and improve their health and wellbeing; and 5. Enabling people to remain in their homes for longer and ensuring vulnerable residents can lead and enjoy independent lives, achieve their goals and have a great future in Southwark; and 6. Delivering a safer walking and cycling network to address the climate emergency; and 7. Increasing, protecting and improving green spaces; and 8. Improving access to healthcare, voluntary organisations and community health facilities; and 9. Introducing the concept of active design which, among other things, makes using the stairs an attractive alternative to using lifts and encourages walking and the use of bicycles for local trips; and 10. Reducing health inequalities by improving the economic wellbeing, physical and mental health of our communities including providing healthy food options, improving air quality, improving green spaces and creating healthy streets and low traffic neighbourhoods to enable our residents to get to everywhere they need to go without using a car. Reasons 1. We will promote healthy streets and thriving neighbourhoods with pleasant town centres to shop, socialise and get access to health services, all within walking distance and very convenient for cycling. This will support ouraim to be an age friendly borough. These policies for improving town centres, building schools,and providing the facilities for cycling and walking will address physical and mental health issuesto improve the every day experiences of residents, workers and shoppers. We will also encourage permanent and temporary community food growing opportunities, improve the quality of green spaces and parks, and ensure residents have access to opportunities for free swimming and gym use, an extended bike hire and cycle network. 2. The shift in transport modes from cars to walking and cycling responds to the Climate Emergency declared by Southwark by reducing car use and improving the health of local residents. 3. Health inequalities are avoidable, unfair and systematic differences in health between different groups of people. Health inequalities arise because of the conditions in which we are born, grow, live, work and age. These conditions influence our opportunities for good health, and how we think, feel and act, and this shapes our mental health, physical health and wellbeing. 4. Levels of health deprivation and disability in the borough are mixed, this relates to the risk of premature death 62 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents and the impairment of quality of life through poor physical or mental health. The most deprived neighbourhoods are spread across the borough. Just over 8% of residents live in communities ranked in the 20% most deprived in England. In contrast, just over 4% live in communities ranked in the 20% least health deprived. SP6 Climate Emergency We will lead the way in providing spaces for people to connect with nature, making people feel safe, creating cleaner streets, increasing recycling, reducing landfill waste, and reducing carbon and greenhouse gas emissions to address the Climate Emergency. This will be achieved through: 1. Protecting, improving and enhancing our environment through making new and existing buildings as energy efficient as possible; and 2. Making Southwark a place where walking, cycling and public transport are the first choice of travel as they are convenient, safe and attractive; and 3. Protecting and improving our network of open spaces, waterways, trees and biodiverse habitats and green corridors that make places open and attractive and provide important sport, leisure and food growing opportunities; and 4. Improving our natural environment through the use of urban greening to reduce flood risk and improve air quality; and 5. Working with local people to deliver the very best so that the borough is clean, green and safe. Reasons 1. The climate change target for this plan is to be net zero by 2050 as set out in the Climate Change Act. The council has declared a Climate Emergency with the ambition to reach carbon neutrality by 2030 and will review this plan to meet this target. 2. We will play a leading role in making Southwark a place where people enjoy spending time and can thrive by ensuring the borough is clean, green and safe. Reducing landfill, remediating contaminated land and increasing recycling and the re-use of waste materials will help us minimise our environmental impact and help to protect biodiversity and habitats for future generations to enjoy. Ensuring buildings are energy efficient and low carbon will help reduce our carbon footprint and our contribution to man-made climate change while also saving money through reduced energy bills for our residents and workers. Prioritising walking, cycling and public transport will also help us reduce our carbon footprint, as well as reduce the congestion and poor air quality. 3. Southwark’s carbon emissions have been reducing since 2010. In 2017 it was 1,013 Total kt (CO2e). 4. Some parts of the borough’s walking and cycling routes are poorly maintained, confusing and can at times 63 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents feel unsafe. Improving these routes will encourage more walking and cycling. Poor air quality has significant health impacts so reducing harmful pollutants is crucial in making a safer and cleaner place. There is also a risk of flooding from both the Thames and surface water pooling. We need to mimic natural drainage patterns by reducing hard surfaces and increase absorbent surfaces through soil and planting. Our parks and open spaces, trees and wildlife habitats are of enormous value so it is essential that we continue to protect and enhance them to ensure they can be enjoyed and used by everyone. 5. The Crime Domain measures the risk of personal and material victimisation at local level. Southwark is ranked as one of the most deprived local authorities in England. There are high levels of crime deprivation across the majority of the borough, with the exception of Borough & Bankside and parts of London Bridge & West Bermondsey. Over a third of residents live in communities ranked in the 20% most crime deprived in England. In contrast, just 5% live in communities ranked in the 20% least crime deprived. 6. The Living Environment Deprivation Domain measures the quality of the local environment, both indoor and outdoor. There are high levels of deprivation relating to the living environment across the borough, with more than half of residents living in communities ranked in the 20% most deprived in England. When looking at the sub-domain that focuses on air quality and road traffic accidents, all residents in Southwark live in communities ranked as the 20% most deprived in England. 64 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Area Visions: Area Visions are policies that provide the strategic vision for the future of Southwark’s distinct places and neighbourhoods. They set out infrastructure improvements, opportunities for improved public spaces, transport improvements and growth opportunities for new homes and jobs. Area Visions also identify the character of different places to be renewed, retained or enhanced. Development proposals should be prepared in the context of the relevant Area Vision and should demonstrate how they contribute towards the strategic vision for that area. 65 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents AV.01 Aylesbury Area Vision The Aylesbury Area is: - \u0007A residential area located north of Burgess Park and between Walworth Road and Old Kent Road. It originally accommodated 2,750 homes and is characterised by buildings built in the mid 1960s – 70s, but which were valued by residents for the number of social rent units and the larger flats and room sizes. They are set amongst mature trees, green and open spaces and play space; - Served by emerging new community infrastructure, which includes three new high-performing schools, existing primary schools, the re-landscaped Burgess Park and sports facilities, including a new BMX cycle track.

London Bridge will also contribute towards meeting the borough’s housing needs. 91 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents London Bridge Area Vision Map 92 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents AV.12 Nunhead Area Vision Nunhead is: - A historic residential area with many pubs, a library and a local community centre; - A visitor destination for Nunhead Cemetery, with a view of St Paul’s Cathedral and Aquarius Golf Course; - Accessible by rail from central London at Nunhead Station and by many local walking, cycling and bus routes; - Home to a thriving shopping centre at Evelina Road with a wide range of independent shops around Nunhead Green that create a village environment. Local shopping parades meet local shopping needs at Forest Hill Road and Cheltenham Road; - A place for sports and activities with good access to parks such as Peckham Rye. Development in Nunhead should: - Provide as many homes as possible while respecting the local character of the area; - Improve walking and cycling routes and public transport; - Complement and improve the town centre offer at Evelina Road, Forest Hill Road and Cheltenham Road, including the retention of small shops. Growth opportunities in Nunhead: - Whilst development opportunities in Nunhead are relatively limited, Nunhead has the potential to contribute towards meeting Southwark’s housing need. Most new homes will be built on infill sites. - Detailed development opportunities in Nunhead were set out in the Peckham and Nunhead Area Action Plan (2014). There are no new development opportunity sites in Nunhead. 93 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents AV.13 Old Kent Road Area Vision Old Kent Road is: - Not just any old road. For 2000 years it has been a vital artery connecting the commerce and culture of one of the world’s great cities to Europe. Its strength as a place to live, work and do business is its central London location and inner city character; - A place with a strong community identity. It has excellent park and local spaces and there is a clear pride in locally maintained community gardens. Burgess Park nearby provides valuable wildlife, open space, play and sports facilities benefitting physical and mental health; - A place with excellent schools, active voluntary organisations and home to many faith groups. Some 10,000 people are employed locally in a wide variety of jobs including manufacturing, transport, the arts, distribution and retail; - Home to many different types of retail, from small shops and cafes on the high street to larger supermarkets, builders merchants and retail warehouses; - A place where pockets of heritage survive from different eras including the Livesey gasworks and the ceramic mural which tells the story of the Old Kent Road. Development in Old Kent Road should: - Deliver direct benefits to the existing community including new and improved homes including new council homes, schools, parks, leisure and health centres, and the creation of a wide range of jobs; - Promote car free development and support the Bakerloo Line extension, electric buses, taxis, commercial vehicles and cycling (including cycle parking and cycle hire) which will help to tackle air and noise pollution, vital for the health of all but particularly the health of children and improving mental and physical wellbeing. This should enable ease of movement around Old Kent Road without using a car, creating clean and tidy streets, good wayfinding and calm and quiet places to travel through, rest and enjoy green spaces; - Help foster a community in which old and young can flourish. Building nursery schools together with older people’s accommodation has had great success in other cities in reducing loneliness and social isolation. There will be opportunities to connect schools and further and higher education institutions with local employers to make the most of the diverse employment opportunities that exist in the Old Kent Road; - Help grow the significant economic base in the Old Kent Road, not just for offices, but over a wide range of skills and job types, including the types of business that service Central London such as the distribution industry and new and growing sectors such as the arts industry. This includes promoting innovative ways of mixing homes with commercial uses and making the best use of space which, done with care, will deliver a place that is desirable to live and work in; - Build new homes that come in a range of types from terraced houses to apartments with a high design quality including generous room sizes, high ceilings and big windows to ensure people have space to think and to rest; - Link existing open spaces like Burgess Park to each other and new park spaces to provide a “Greener Belt” network accommodating play, sports, growing spaces, nature and places to just sit and contemplate. The 95 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents ambition is to create an environment that delights the senses. There will be new neighbourhoods that promote physical activity, social interaction and shield from pollution and feeling unsafe; - Demonstrate excellent standards of environmental sustainability including pioneering new district heating networks to reduce carbon emissions, measures to tackle poor air quality and sustainable urban drainage systems to reduce flood risk. Growth opportunities in Old Kent Road: - The Old Kent Road Area Action Plan will set out the physical framework that will enable the community to realise its potential. The construction of the Bakerloo Line Extension will drive the growth of central London southwards encompassing Old Kent Road. - The Area Action Plan will identify the opportunities for growth and benefits for local communities including delivering 20,000 new homes, over 10,000 new jobs, 9ha of new parks, civic spaces, green routes and raingardens, two new tube stations and two district town centres for shopping. - Development will be phased based on the commitment and delivery of the Bakerloo Line extension. It is anticipated around 9,500 homes will be committed in Phase 1 (2018-2023) alongside enhancements to the existing public transport network prior to the letting of the construction contract for the Bakerloo Line extension. The remaining 10,500 will be committed for Phase 2 (post 2023) and will be subject to agreement between Southwark Council, the Greater London Authority and Transport for London relating to the status of transport improvements. A detailed phasing plan is included in the Southwark Plan 2022 Infrastructure Plan and in the Old Kent Road Area Action Plan. - The Department for Transport has made a safeguarding direction for the Bakerloo Line Extension which will support the project in safeguarding sites and routing alignment. The Bakerloo Line extension will enable the planned development for Phase 2 to be delivered and will provide a further catalyst for change. 96 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Old Kent Road Area Vision Map 97 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents AV.14 Peckham Area Vision Peckham is: - A lively town centre providing a range of daytime and night time activities on Rye Lane including a library, a leisure centre, cinema, market traders and many independent retailers which specialise in West African goods. Bellenden Road is a quieter alternative. Much of the town centre activity spills over to busy side streets and the area is further enlivened by active faith and other community groups; - An area with a burgeoning sector of small and medium enterprises, many of which are creative industries. Copeland Park and the Bussey Building, the railway arches, Peckham Rye Station and Peckham Levels have become a focus for these industries; - An area of heritage value, particularly in the conservation areas with many interesting Victorian, Edwardian and inter-war buildings, including Peckham Rye Station, and the Baptist church with the former Jones and Higgins department store at the heart of Peckham town centre. Outside designated conservation area the historic residential layout remains intact; - A place for sports and activities with local parks which support leisure and cultural activities. Examples include Peckham Square, Peckham Rye Station Square, Peckham Rye Common and the Surrey Canal Walk connecting Peckham to Burgess Park and beyond; - Accessible by rail from central London and wider London with stations at Peckham Rye and Queen’s Road along with many bus routes. Peckham is very accessible for walking and cycling. Development in Peckham should: - Complement and improve the town centre with more large and small shops, market stalls, and entertainment, cultural, community and leisure spaces alongside new employment space for small and medium enterprises including start-ups; - Provide as many homes as possible of all tenures including social housing while respecting the local character. Residential development must not compromise the operation of existing commercial and night time uses, particularly in the town centre; - Support new educational centres which will increase education and employment opportunities and bring new footfall to the town centre; - Increase or improve the quality of local open spaces and squares, particularly Peckham Rye, Peckham Square and Peckham Rye Station Square to meet the needs of the growing population and provide new opportunities for recreation and leisure; - Prioritise walking, cycling and improve public transport, including accessibility to Peckham Rye station from the new square, while improving servicing and waste management on the high street; - Contribute towards the development of the Low Line and the Peckham Coal Line, new public realm corridors adjacent to historic railway arches, with lively accessible spaces for creativity, new jobs and retail; - Reveal and enhance Peckham’s underlying historic townscape. 98 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Growth opportunities in Peckham: - The Peckham and Nunhead Area Action Plan was adopted in 2014 and identified 24 sites for development. These have mostly been completed, are under construction or approved. They have delivered 350 homes, 300sqm employment floorspace, 1,900sqm retail floorspace and 14,500sqm community and education facilities including the Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts and an extension to Bredinghurst School. Sites approved or under construction will deliver 433 homes, 940sqm retail floorspace and 3,000sqm community facilities. Larger town centre sites not yet developed have been included in this plan. - Site allocations in the Peckham Action Area will provide around 1,400 new homes, around 22,200sqm (gross) retail, community and leisure floorspace and around 19,000sqm (gross) employment space. There are also many smaller development sites that could accommodate new homes and new employment space. Peckham Major Town Centre will deliver around 7,000sqm (net) new retail floorspace. 99 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Peckham Area Vision Map 100 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents AV.15 Rotherhithe Area Vision Rotherhithe is: - A relatively new residential neighbourhood built on former docks and surrounded by historic riverside development. The transformation of the Rotherhithe peninsula is incomplete and there are significant opportunities for further growth; - Home to a thriving town centre at Canada Water that is a busy destination for shopping and entertainment and higher density homes. Local shopping is provided in shopping parades at Albion Street and Lower Road; - Accessible by tube and rail from Canada Water and Surrey Docks stations with improved bus connections, walking and cycling routes. However, accessibility for all modes of transport including the use of the River Thames as an alternative form of transportation and congestion require improvement; - A place for sports and activities with a network of parks, woodland, docks, marina, leisure and water sports centres and a long stretch of the Thames riverside; - Of historical and archaeological interest, containing significant sites relating to the prehistoric development of Rotherhithe Peninsular as a landform, connections with the Mayflower, the historic village of Rotherhithe and the industrial history of the Surrey Commercial Docks. Development in Rotherhithe should: - Create a new destination around the Canada Water basin which combines shopping, civic, education, and leisure, business and residential uses. - Provide as many homes as possible of a range of tenures including social housing while respecting the local character. There will be opportunities for taller buildings on key development sites; - Transform the Canada Water into a new heart for Rotherhithe with a new leisure centre, shops and daytime and evening events and activities around the basin and in the Harmsworth Quays Printworks. New retail space will be provided including a new department store and independent shops, offices and places to eat and drink; - Provide new education opportunities and health services which will include new school places and a health centre with GPs and could include colleges and universities; - Complement and improve the historic character, including the docks, and the unique network of open spaces, water and riverside; - Prioritise walking and cycling and improve public transport, including improved links to Southwark Park, the river, boat services and docks, completion of the Thames Path, a new river crossing to Canary Wharf, better circulation of buses, enhanced cycle routes to support expansion of cycle hire to the area and creating ‘healthy streets’; - Improve traffic flow on the road network, particularly on Jamaica Road and Lower Road; - Provide a range of flexible employment spaces, including premises suitable for smaller businesses; - Improve roads, pavements and cycleways, particularly the local environment around Albion Street and Lower Road. 101 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Growth opportunities in Rotherhithe: - The Canada Water Area Action Plan was adopted in 2015 and identified 18 sites for development. These have mostly been completed. They have delivered over 1,200 homes, 1,300sqm employment floorspace, 900sqm retail floorspace and 7,000sqm community facilities. Sites approved or under construction will deliver 407 homes, 610sqm retail floorspace and 300sqm community facilities. - Rotherhithe is part of the Canada Water Opportunity Area delivering 20,000 jobs and the Canada Water Major Town Centre will provide at least 40,000sqm (net) new retail uses. Site allocations in Rotherhithe have enormous potential to provide new homes and commercial space, particularly in and around the Canada Water town centre. The site allocations including the Canada Water masterplan to redevelop the Surrey Quays shopping centre, Harmsworth Quays and Surrey Quays Leisure Park have the potential to deliver an average of 4,300 new homes, 186,000sqm (gross) office and employment workspaces and 134,250sqm (gross) retail, community and leisure uses as well as 1.35ha new open space. King’s College are building a campus with teaching and student accommodation. The College may also be interested in building more teaching facilities which would provide a valuable facility at Canada Water. Larger sites and smaller infill sites could provide new homes outside the town centre. 102 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Rotherhithe Area Vision Map 103 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents AV.16 Walworth Area Vision Walworth is: - A residential part of central London and is distinctive for its heritage value, diverse community and network of small parks and squares linked by accessible cycling and walking routes; - An area of historic importance that includes a Georgian high street whose value has been recognised with its designation as a Conservation Area, the listed Walworth Town Hall, Newington Library and Health Centre buildings and the Grade I listed St Peter’s Church; - An area which has undergone sensitive regeneration to provide high quality, modern new homes; - A successful shopping destination which offers a diverse range of independent shops and services along Walworth Road and East Street Market; - Accessible by tube and rail from Elephant and Castle as well as providing many walking and cycling routes and the TfL bike hire scheme; - A place for sports and community activities such as Pembroke House, East Street library, the Southwark Resource Centre, local parks and leisure activities with walking and cycling routes. Development in Walworth should: - Provide as many homes as possible while respecting the local character of the area; - Improve the retail and service offer of Walworth Road and East Street Market shopping environment, including shop front improvements; - Improve cycling and walking routes between Old Kent Road, Elephant and Castle, Burgess Park and Walworth Road; - Improve the connections of neighbourhoods and communities across Walworth Road and the creation of local centres; - Improve the local parks and green links between Burgess Park, Nursery Row Park, Lorrimore Square Gardens, Surrey Square and Victory Community Park, Faraday Gardens and Salisbury Row Park; - Contribute towards the development of the Low Line, a new public realm corridor adjacent to historic railway arches, with lively accessible spaces for creativity, new jobs and retail; - Provide new Walworth Road and East Street, railway arches and Pullens Yards should provide small, independent businesses for the local communities with such diverse cultures. Growth opportunities in Walworth: - Site Allocations in Walworth have the potential to provide around 230 new homes, 7,400sqm (gross) new retail, community and leisure space as part of the Elephant and Castle Major Town Centre, new community facilities and improvements to the street network. There are also smaller scale opportunities for infill development and public realm and shop front improvements. There will be a new library relocated from East Street. 104 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Walworth Area Vision Map 105 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Development Management Policies Development management policies set out further detail which is required to deliver the strategic policies. They are used to assess planning applications. Homes for all P1 Social rented and intermediate housing Percentage 1. Development that creates 10 or more homes must provide the maximum viable amount of social rented and intermediate homes. The minimum amount should be 35%, as set out in Table 1, subject to viability. Except in the Aylesbury Action Area Core, as set out in Table 2. Intermediate tenure homes should be suitable for households on a range of incomes. This may require a mix of shared ownership and other intermediate tenure homes. 2. Development that creates 9 homes or fewer (inclusive) must provide the maximum amount of social rented and intermediate homes or a financial contribution towards the delivery of new council social rented and intermediate homes with a minimum of 35% subject to viability as set out in Table 1. Viability 3. Viability appraisals and reviews are required for all developments. These must be published for public scrutiny. 4. In exceptional circumstances development can follow the fast track route. Either: 1. Where development provides 40% social rented and intermediate housing, with a policy compliant tenure mix, (a minimum of 25% social rented and a minimum of 10% intermediate housing) as set out in Table 1 with no grant subsidy. Where developments follow the fast track route they will not be subject to a viability appraisal. A viability appraisal will be necessary if amendments are proposed to lower the affordable housing provision to less than 40% following the grant of planning permission; or 2. In Aylesbury Area Action Core, where development provides 60% social rented and intermediate housing with a policy compliant tenure mix as set out in Table 2, with no grant subsidy. Where developments follow the fast track route they will not be subject to a viability appraisal. A viability review will be necessary if amendments are proposed to lower the social rented and intermediate housing provision to less than 60% following the grant of planning permission. 5. Where development cannot provide social rented and intermediate housing on site, any off site social rented and intermediate housing requirement will be measured as the total housing provision from the main development site plus any linked sites. This should provide no financial benefit to the applicant. 106 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 6. Where social and intermediate housing cannot be provided on site or off site a cash payment towards the delivery of new council homes will be required. The value of any contributions will be based on the cost of meeting an on site social and intermediate housing requirement and should provide no financial benefit to the applicant. 7. The subdivision of sites or phasing of development which has the effect of circumventing social and intermediate housing policy requirements will not be permitted. 8. Housing requirements will be calculated in habitable rooms. 9. Use of the ‘Vacant Building Credit’ will not be accepted.

If social rented and intermediate housing provision marginally falls below the minimum, we will not accept rounding up. This may increase the overall quantum which should be in favour of social rented housing. Table 2: Aylesbury social rented and intermediate housing requirement |Col1|Market housing|Social rented and intermediate housing requirement (75% social rented, 25% intermediate housing)| |||| |Area Action Core|50%|50%| |Proposal Site AAAP1 (Phase 1)|41%|59%| |Proposal Sites AAAP2 and AAAP3 (Phases 2 and 3)|50%|50%| |Proposal Site AAAP4 (Phase 4)|58%|42%| Reasons 1. There is a shortage of social rented and intermediate homes in Southwark and this is our priority in the delivery of new homes. Providing new affordable homes suitable for a range of affordable housing needs is our main priority. This includes social rent and intermediate tenure homes. We do not use the term affordable to describe any specific type or tenure of new housing. We use the descriptive terms of social rented and intermediate housing. 107 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 2. Our Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) identifies a need for 2,077 social rented and intermediate homes per annum which is approximately 71% of Southwark’s total housing need. CACI Paycheck data confirms that 93% of households in Southwark have a household income that requires social and intermediate housing. There is a high proportion of residents that require some type of affordable housing, as such, we require social rented and intermediate housing to be provided on all developments, as either on site, as a priority in major developments, or contributions for minor developments. Contributions agreed through Section 106 agreements will go towards the delivery of council homes. 3. There are a wide range of housing products which meet the needs of households with different incomes. Social rented and intermediate housing is accepted by Southwark. 4. Social rented housing is typically most needed by households on lower incomes who can least afford to pay market prices for suitable housing (typically households with incomes up to £20,000 per year). 5. Intermediate housing includes a range of products that can meet the needs of middle income households who cannot afford suitable housing at market prices but who can afford to pay more for their housing than households in social rented housing. The Mayor of London considers the most suitable type of affordable housing for households with annual incomes up to £60,000 needs are best met by low cost rented housing (intermediate rent). Southwark prioritises London Living Rent, or a Discount Market Rent equivalent to London Living Rent, as an intermediate rent product. This is separate to our consideration of social rent which is always our priority. 6. Households with incomes of between £60,000 and £90,000 have needs that can be met through Shared Ownership homes. Southwark only considers Shared Ownership housing to be appropriate for households with incomes close to the locally and annually set shared ownership income eligibility thresholds (£47,290 for a 1-bed, £55,876 for a 2-bed, £64,863 for a 3-bed and £73,561 for a 4-bed). 7. As idenitifed in the SHMA approximately 78% of our total affordable housing need is for intermediate housing to meet the housing needs of lower and middle income residents. However, the most acute need is for social rented housing to meet the needs of homeless households living in unsuitable temporary accommodation such as bed and breakfasts or overcrowded conditions. Overcrowding is strongly related to poor physical and mental health and can strain family relationships. Children in overcrowded homes often achieve poorly at school and suffer disturbed sleep. Social rented housing is vital to social regeneration as it allows residents who cannot afford market housing to remain close to their families, friends and employment. For this reason we require a minimum 25% of homes to be provided as social rented housing on all major developments. 8. To encourage developments to provide a higher provision of social rented and intermediate housing, we have introduced the fast track route for schemes providing 40% social rented and intermediate housing and 60% in Aylesbury Action Area Core. 108 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 9. Where developments provide social rented and intermediate housing above 35% or as per table 2, tenure flexibility will be applied to the additional amount. For developments proposed on public sector land the Mayor’s approach will be followed. Where planning applications are not following the fast track route they are required to show that the developments are viable and deliverable and provide a full viability appraisal. 10. Where development has been phased or a site is subdivided to impact upon the provision of social rented and intermediate homes, this will not be permitted. We need to ensure we get the maximum provision of social rented and intermediate homes and our priority is for this to be delivered on site in the first instance. 11. Social rented and intermediate housing should be provided on site on schemes of 10 units or more, only in exceptional circumstances will they be permitted off site or a payment in lieu will be accepted. For schemes providing 9 homes or less (inclusive), social rented and intermediate housing can either be provided on site or a payment in lieu can be provided to go towards the delivery of council homes. Where on site social rented and intermediate housing is being provided and 35% of habitable rooms cannot be delivered as a whole housing unit, the equivalent payment in lieu should be provided. 12. Housing requirements will be calculated in habitable rooms. Where a habitable room exceeds 28sqm, the number of habitable rooms will be calculated as set out in the habitable rooms fact box below to ensure we get the maximum amount of social rented and intermediate homes. 109 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 110 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 111 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents |Area (sqm)|Habitable Rooms| ||| |0-28|1| |28.1-42|2| |42.1-56|3| |56.1-70|4| |70.1-84|5| |84.1-98|6| |98.1-112 112.1-126 126.1-140 140.1-154|7 8 9 10| 112 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P2 New family homes 1. Major residential developments, including conversions, must provide: 1. A minimum of 60% of homes with two or more bedrooms; and 70% in Aylesbury Action Area Core with two or more bedrooms; and 2. A minimum of 20% of family homes with three or more bedrooms in the Central Activities Zone and Action Area Cores (see Figure 3); or 3. A minimum of 25% of homes with three or more bedrooms in the urban zone (see Figure 3); or 4. A minimum of 30% of homes with three or more bedrooms in the suburban zone (see Figure 3); and 5. A minimum of 7% of homes with four beds in the Aylesbury Action Area Core; and 6. A minimum of 3% of homes with five beds in the Aylesbury Action Area Core; and 7. A maximum of 5% studios and 3% studios in the Aylesbury Action Area Core, which can only be for private housing; and 8. Two bedroom homes as a mix of two bedroom 3 person and two bedroom 4 person homes. 2. Family homes in apartment blocks should have direct access to outdoor amenity space and allow oversight of children outside. Reasons 1. The SHMA shows that the highest need in social rented and homes of up to 50% of a low market rent is two, three and four bedroom units for which there is a shortfall of 659 units. There is an oversupply of one bed units of 200 out of a supply of 1,272 homes in this group. 2. For intermediate units the undersupply varies between different thresholds for all bedroom sizes, however there is an undersupply in all. The SHMA also shows that for market housing there is a requirement of 20% one-bed homes, 30% two-bed homes, 34% 3-bed homes and 16% four-bed homes. 3. We require a minimum proportion of new homes to provide two beds or more because studios and one bed homes are unsuitable for families. Studio apartments do not adequately meet the housing needs of most households. 4. Two bed homes can meet the needs of smaller families; however, to meet the needs of larger families we require the provision of some family homes with three or more bedrooms. The proportion of family homes required in urban and suburban settings is greater because these parts of the borough provide greater opportunities to build family homes as they are better able to accommodate adequate amenity space. 5. Requiring a mix of two bedroom 3 person and two bedroom 4 person homes will provide flexibility and ensure a range of dwelling sizes are provided to meet the needs of different family sizes. 113 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 6. Family homes in apartment blocks should have direct access to outdoor amenity space and allow oversight of children outside so children will be encouraged to use the space and can safely do so. 7. Building more family housing will help to address overcrowding and provide opportunities for families to live in all of our neighbourhoods, benefitting their health and wellbeing, and increasing opportunities for foster care. Figure 3: Family Housing Areas 114 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P3 Protection of existing homes 1. The sub-division of a single dwelling of 130sqm or less (original net internal floorspace, excluding attics and basements and other parts of the building not intended for habitation) into two or more homes will not be permitted. 2. The net loss of existing housing, including to short-stay accommodation, will not be permitted except: 1. Where existing location and standard of accommodation is unsatisfactory and cannot be improved; or 2. Where the residential accommodation is on a site which is allocated in the development plan for an alternative use in preference to housing. Reasons The high level of need for family homes, as evidenced by our SHMA, means it is important that we protect our existing family housing stock from conversion into smaller homes which would be unsuitable for housing families. Protection of individual family homes avoids the potential cumulative effects of loss of family homes to more intensive use of land. Private rented homes P4 1. New self-contained, private rented homes in developments providing less than 100 homes must comply with policy P1. 2. New self-contained, private rented homes in developments providing 100 homes or more must: 1. Provide security and professional management for the homes; and 2. Provide a mix of housing sizes, reflecting local need for rented property; and 3. Provide the same design standards required for build-for-sale homes; and 4. Provide tenancies for private renters for a minimum of three years with a six month break clause in the tenant’s favour and structured and limited in-tenancy rent increases agreed in advance; and 5. Meet Southwark’s Private Rent Standard; and 6. Be secured for the rental market for a minimum 30 year term. Where any private rented homes are sold from the private rented sector within 30 years this will trigger a clawback mechanism resulting in a penalty charge towards affordable housing; and 7. Provide maximum amount, with a minimum of 35% affordable homes in accordance with policy P1 or Table 3, subject to viability. Where the provision of private rented homes generates a higher development value than if the homes were built for sale, the minimum affordable housing require-­ ment will increase to the point where there is no financial benefit to providing private rented homes over build for sale homes; and 8. Be subject to a viability review to increase the number of and/or the affordability of affordable homes where an improvement in scheme viability is demonstrated between the grant of planning permission and the time of the review. 115 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 3. Discount Market Rent homes at social rent equivalent must be allocated to households on Southwark’s social housing waiting list. All other Discount Market Rent homes must be allocated in accordance with South-­ wark’s Intermediate Rent Housing Policy. Table 3: Affordable housing requirement option on qualifying private rented homes schemes |Market housing|Afof rdable housing|Col3| |||| |Up to 65%|A minimum of 35%|| ||Social rent equivalent|Afof rdable rent capped at London Living Rent equivalent| ||A minimum of 15%*|A minimum of 20%*| - Applicants must meet the minimum requirement. If social rented equivalent and affordable rent capped at London Living Rent equivalent housing provision marginally falls below the minimum, we will not accept rounding up. This may increase the overall quantum which should be in favour of affordable rent capped at London Living Rent equivalent. This is separate to our consideration of social rent in conventional housing which is always our overall priority. Reasons 1. We recognise that the private rented sector meets the housing needs of residents who cannot afford to, or do not want to buy private homes in Southwark. The private rented sector grew by 17% nationally between 2011 and 2017 (according to the English Housing Survey (EHS)). The provision of homes in the private rented sector in Southwark is between 32,300 (extrapolating an increase from the 2001 to 2011 Census) and 37,400 homes (EHS). 2. Private renting households often live in some of the worst quality, poorly managed accommodation. Furthermore, the majority of private renting households have very limited security of tenure which is particularly damaging for households with children and some renters face arbitrary evictions and unjustified rent increases. The private rented sector has the potential to increase Southwark’s housing supply because developers have fewer concerns about the rate at which the market can absorb new homes. 3. The private rented sector also benefits the local and regional economy as it enables greater household mobility. We want to encourage a private rented sector which provides high quality, professionally managed accommodation and a greater level of security for tenants to that which is offered by much of 116 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents the current private rented sector. We will support institutional investment in the sector where benefits are secured for residents through agreement. Southwark’s Private Rent Standard is a code of good practice for private landlords. The policy applies to larger- scale development (schemes providing 100 homes or more) because larger schemes are best placed to provide a high quality rental offer to tenants renting privately and tenants in Discount Market Rent homes. P5 Student homes Development of purpose-built student housing must: 1. Provide 5% of student rooms as easily adaptable for occupation by wheelchair users; and 2. When providing direct lets at market rent, provide the maximum amount, with a minimum of 35% as conventional affordable housing by habitable room subject to viability, as per policy P4, as a first priority. In addition to this, 27% of student rooms must be let at a rent that is affordable to students as defined by the Mayor of London; or 3. When providing all of the student rooms for nominated further and higher education institutions, provide the maximum amount of affordable student rooms with a minimum of 35% subject to viability. The affordable student rent should be set as defined by the Mayor of London. Reasons 1. There is a need for more student accommodation across the whole of London. However this needs to be balanced with making sure we have enough sites for other types of homes, including affordable and family homes. Whilst London as a whole has a recognised need for more student bed spaces, we have one of the largest provisions of student homes in London. 2. Our Strategic Housing Market Assessment highlights an acute need for more family and affordable housing. Allowing too much student accommodation will restrict our ability to deliver more family and affordable housing. By requiring an element of affordable housing or a contribution towards affordable housing from student housing development providing direct lets we can make sure we work towards meeting the strategic need for student accommodation and our local need for affordable homes including affordable family homes. 3. Where nomination schemes or schemes developed directly directly by the university, the maximum amount of affordable student rooms should be provided. The development will maintain a nomination agreement or enter into a new nomination agreement with one or more higher education provider(s) for as long as it is used as student accommodation. 4. Affordable rents will be set using the Mayor of London’s guidance. 117 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P6 Purpose built shared living Development of purpose-built shared living must: 1. Provide the maximum amount, with a minimum of 35% conventional affordable housing by habitable room subject to viability as per Policy P4, as a first priority. Where affordable housing cannot be provided on site a cash payment towards the delivery of new council homes will be required. The value of any contributions will be based on the cost of meeting an on site affordable housing requirement and should provide no financial benefit to the applicant. 2. All purpose-built shared living schemes will require a viability appraisal to be submitted. Reasons 1. There is a requirement for purpose built shared living accommodation across the whole of London. However this needs to be balanced with making sure we have enough sites for other types of homes, including affordable and family homes. 2. Our Strategic Housing Market Assessment highlights an acute need for more family and affordable homes. Allowing too much purpose built shared living accommodation will restrict our ability to deliver more family and affordable housing. By requiring an element of affordable housing or contribution towards affordable housing from purpose built shared living accommodation we can make sure we work towards meeting the strategic need for this accommodation and our local need for affordable homes including affordable family homes. P7 Housing for older people 1. Development of new specialist housing for older people must: 1. Provide conventional social rented and intermediate housing in accordance with Policy P1 or specialist affordable accommodation for older people, subject to need. The need for affordable specialist accommodation for older people and the suitability of any proposed provision will be determined by the council. There should be no financial benefit to the developer in providing affordable specialist older people accommodation in place of conventional social rented and intermediate housing; and 2. Provide excellent accessibility and amenity for residents and adequate communal areas and space for on site services and facilities; and 3. Be located in areas suitable for older people which have good access to local goods and services and be located in, or close to town centres. 2. A loss of specialist housing for older people will only be permitted where alternative accommodation is provided elsewhere, subject to need. The acceptability of replacement provision will be based on the number of bed-spaces, suitability of location and affordability of accommodation. 118 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Reasons 1. We will meet the needs of older residents who develop physical or sensory impairments, such as dementia, through helping them to stay in their own homes through adaptations to their existing homes. This is the most popular housing option for Southwark’s older people. However, there will always be a need for specialist types of older people’s housing, including extra-care housing and nursing home provision, to meet the needs of older people who are unable to remain in their own homes. Other forms of specialist older people housing options include sheltered housing, consisting of self-contained individual apartments, almshouses and co-housing schemes. 2. We will work with registered providers and other relevant partners to support the provision of different types of specialist housing for older people, including affordable specialist housing for older people, where there is a clearly identified local need. This will ensure that there is a wider choice of housing options for Southwark’s older residents. P8 Wheelchair accessible and adaptable housing 1. New build major residential development must: 1. Meet Building Regulation M4(3) standard (Wheelchair User Dwellings) in at least 10% of homes (as measured in habitable rooms) and 2. The remaining dwellings must meet Building Regulation M4(2) (accessible and adaptable dwellings) and; 3. Where those homes are affordable wheelchair user homes, 10% of social rented homes must be wheelchair accessible and meet Building Regulation M4(3)(2)(b) standard (Wheelchair accessible dwellings). 2. New build residential development must: 1. Provide a mix of dwelling sizes and tenures that meet the above standards, including family homes. Two bedroom three person affordable wheelchair homes will not be acceptable; and 2. Provide wheelchair accessible homes that meet the minimum space standards set out in Table 4; and 3. Provide affordable wheelchair homes that meet the design and access standards set out in Table 5; and 4. Provide access to a second lift where wheelchair accessible or wheelchair adaptable units are above the ground floor; and 5. Provide affordable wheelchair homes which, where unoccupied, must be let as local authority temporary accommodation until a suitable permanent household is identified; and 6. Provide alternative specialist housing to meet specific needs in place of an affordable wheelchair 119 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents user home where the council has identified a specialist housing need; and 7. Where wheelchair accessible homes cannot be provided on site, a financial contribution will be required towards the provision of new affordable wheelchair homes or the adaptation of existing affordable homes to wheelchair user standard. The financial contribution will be the equivalent to the cost of fitting out a new home or existing homes to a wheelchair user standard. Table 4: Accessible wheelchair user housing minimum space standards |Number of bedrooms|MMiinniimmuumm ssppaaccee ((aappaarrttmmeennttss)) ((ssqqmm))|Minimum space (houses) (sqm)| |||| |1b2p|65|N/A| |2b3p|75|80| |2b4p|85|100| |3b4p|100|110| |3b5p|110|120| |3b6p|115|125| Table 5: Wheelchair homes hesign and access standards 120 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Reasons 1. There is an unmet need for affordable wheelchair accessible housing and alternative types of specialist housing which meet the needs of people with disabilities that are not met by wheelchair accessible housing. Southwark residents are living longer, with a 79% increase in the population of Southwark aged 65 or more forecast between 2019-2039. This demographic trend includes a gradual increase in the number of older households with disabled members, and in particular, those with wheelchair needs. To ensure that all potential residents have choice within a development, wheelchair accessible or wheelchair adaptable housing is required across all tenures and housing types. The need for wheelchair accessible homes is particularly concentrated on the social rented tenure, developments providing social rented homes will therefore be required to provide a proportion of homes as wheelchair accessible. The need for social rented wheelchair accessible, wheelchair adaptable or lifetime homes is informed by the council’s Housing Register waiting list. We will use planning conditions to specify those social rented homes that must comply with Part M4(3)(2)(b) requirements for “wheelchair accessible” dwellings. The council will use planning conditions to secure wheelchair user dwellings that comply with Part M4(3)(2)(a) requirements for “wheelchair adaptable” dwellings. 2. The council recognises that a range of different types of specialist housing is required to meet the needs of people with disabilities; this includes, but is not limited to, people with ambulatory difficulties, blindness, learning difficulties, autism and mental health needs. Accordingly, developers should work with the council, registered providers or other relevant partners to identify and provide for a range of specialist housing needs where appropriate. 3. To ensure the provision of the highest quality and safest wheelchair user homes we have set out minimum space standards which all affordable wheelchair user homes will need to meet. Fact Box: Wheelchair accessible: dwellings that are constructed to be suitable for immediate occupation by a wheelchair user and where the Building Regulation standard M4(3)(2)(b) applies. Wheelchair adaptable: dwellings that are constructed with the potential to be adapted for occupation by a wheelchair user and where the Building Regulation standard M4(3) (2)(a) applies M4(2): Part M4 Category 2 ‘accessible and adaptable dwellings’, requires dwellings to make reasonable provision for most people to access the dwelling and incorporates features that make it potentially suitable for a wide range of occupants, including older people, those with reduced mobility and some wheelchair users. M4(3): Part M4 Category 3 ‘wheelchair user dwellings’, requires dwellings to make reasonable provision, either at completion or at a point following completion, for a wheelchair user to live in the dwelling and use any associated private outdoor space, parking and communal facilities that may be provided for the use of occupants. 121 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P9 Houses in multiple occupation New houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) must: 1. Not contribute to an overconcentration within the local area. Overconcentration will be assessed where the character of the area has changed or the local amenity of the area is impacted as a result of: 1. Increased noise; 2. Impacts on visual amenity as a result of properties not being maintained; 3. Anti-social behaviour; 4. Pressures on parking provision and cycle storage; 5. Pressures on local community facilities; or 6. Stress on waste management facilities 2. Meet the council’s Standards for HMOs; and 3. Provide adequate indoor communal space, outdoor communal amenity space, refuse and recyling storage and one cycle parking space per occupant; and 4. Provide affordable housing contributions in accordance with policy P1. Reasons 1. Houses in multiple occupation meet the housing needs of some households and can reduce pressure on conventional housing stock. HMOs typically provide housing for people who cannot afford to access, or do not wish to access, self-contained accommodation. Whilst HMOs are generally not considered suitable for families, the number of families occupying such accommodation has risen in response to the acute shortage of affordable self-contained homes. 2. We require HMOs to provide good standards of accommodation such as the council’s HMO Standards because they can often be of poor quality. The minimum standards relate to fire protection, room sizes and amenity provision which are important to ensure they offer accommodation that provides the minimum facilities that people need. They also refer to repair and management regulations. 3. Too many HMOs can lead to a quick turnover of residents and amenity problems due to the often temporary nature of accommodation offered. Change of use from a conventional house to an HMO is permitted development where the dwelling house is for use by three to six residents. However, larger HMOs require planning permission. Where there is already a high concentration of HMOs of any type in one particular area, we may consider the use of Article 4 Directions to remove permitted development rights for the smaller types of HMOs enabling us to manage numbers. 122 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P10 Supported housing and hostels 1. Change of use from supported housing and hostels to other uses will not be permitted where the existing use meets an identified local housing need. 2. New supported housing and hostels providing accommodation and support for vulnerable people must: 1. Not contribute to an overconcentration within the local area. Overconcentration will be assessed where the character of the area has changed or the local amenity of the area is impacted as a result of: 1. Increased noise; 2. Impacts on visual amenity; 3. Anti-social behaviour 4. Pressures on parking provision and cycle storage 5. Pressures on local community facilities; or 6. Stress on waste management facilities 2. Provide adequate indoor communal space, outdoor communal amenity space, refuse and recycling storage and one cycle parking space per occupant; and 3. Provide a staffing and management plan showing how the property will be managed and the amenity of occupants and neighbours will be protected. Reasons 1. Supported housing and hostels provide housing for vulnerable people with additional needs who may otherwise be homeless or resort to rough sleeping. Residents usually receive extra support from specialist staff, ranging from weekly visits to more regular intensive support. The accommodation and support is provided by organisations with expertise in supporting people to improve their life skills and opportunities. It is important to protect the supply of supported housing and hostels where there is an identified local housing need to ensure vulnerable residents can access suitable accommodation to support their needs. 2. Too many hostels and other types of supported housing can lead to a quick turnover of residents and amenity problems due to the temporary nature of accommodation offered. Given the transient nature of this type of accommodation, an overconcentration in one area may have an impact on the character or local amenity of the area. 123 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P11 Self and custom build Development of serviced plots of land suitable for self and custom build homes should be permitted where: 1. There is evidence of sufficient self-build demand from people or groups on Southwark’s Self and Custom Build Register; and 2. Homes on the plots are to be occupied by people or groups on Southwark’s Self and Custom Build Register. Reasons 1. To understand demand we will maintain a register of people or groups who wish to commission or build their own homes. These people or groups must provide evidence of a local connection and adequate financial resources to purchase a self-build plot. This will ensure that the requirement generated by the register reflects local demand and is deliverable. 2. As the supply of urban land is under significant pressure for a wide range of land uses in Southwark, the demand for self and custom build housing must be met in a way that makes efficient use of land. Self and custom build homes must therefore achieve an appropriate density. P12 Homes for Travellers and Gypsies We will continue to protect our existing Traveller and Gypsy sites. We will work towards providing new sites in the future to meet the accommodation needs of Travellers and Gypsies. We will do this by: 1. Safeguarding the existing four Traveller and Gypsy sites in Southwark as shown on the Policies Map and; 2. Identifying new sites for additional accommodation to meet the needs of Travellers and Gypsies having regard to: 1. The need for safe access to the road network; and 2. The impact on the local environment and character; and 3. The impact on amenity; and 4. The availability of essential services, such as water, sewerage and drainage and waste disposal; and 5. The proximity to shops, services and community facilities; and 6. The need to avoid areas at high risk of flooding. Reasons 1. We support the culture and traditions of Gypsies and Travellers in Southwark. Southwark’s Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Needs Assessment 2020 identifies a need for 0 pitches for those who meet the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (PPTS 2015) definition and a need for 43 pitches for those who do not meet the definition but who seek culturally appropriate accommodation of which 27 pitches are needed in the five 124 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents year period 2020/21 to 2024/5. We will work to address the need for culturally appropriate accommodation wherever possible. This could be at a local, sub-regional or regional level. Where culturally appropriate accommodation is not possible, the need for accommodation will be addressed through the plan-making process. 2. We currently have 42 authorised Gypsy and Travellers’ pitches across four sites which is one of the highest in London. The four sites are Brideale Close, Burnhill Close, Ilderton Road and Springtide Close and we have shown these on our Planning Policies Map. We will protect these sites to make sure they remain as homes for Gypsies and Travellers. 3. We will work with the Mayor of London on the London-wide assessment for the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers to work towards meeting the needs of the Gypsy and Traveller community in London. This work will help to inform future policies in Southwark where necessary. Any future sites that come forward for the purposes of Gypsy and Traveller accommodation will be assessed against the criteria set out in policy P11 to ensure safe and good quality accommodation is provided. 125 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Southwark Together P13 Design of places Development must: 1. Ensure height, scale, massing and arrangement respond positively to the existing townscape, character and context; and 2. Better reveal local distinctiveness and architectural character; and conserve and enhance the significance of the local historic environment; and 3. Ensure the urban grain and site layout take account of and improve existing patterns of development and movement, permeability and street widths; and 4. Ensure buildings, public spaces, open spaces and routes are positioned according to their function, importance and use; and 5. Ensure a high quality public realm that encourages walking and cycling and is safe, legible, and attractive, and eases the movement of pedestrians, cyclists, pushchairs, wheelchairs and mobility scooters and vehicular traffic. Street clutter should be avoided; and 6. Provide landscaping which is appropriate to the context, including the provision and retention of street trees, and 7. Provide the use of green infrastructure through the principles of water sensitive urban design, including quiet green spaces, tree pit rain gardens in addition to green grid spaces for people and surface water runoff; and 8. Provide accessible and inclusive design for all ages and people with disabilities; and 9. Provide opportunities for formal and informal play; and 10. Provide adequate outdoor seating for residents and visitors. Reasons 1. It is important to take the principles of urban design into consideration when designing new development. This is to ensure that new development improves the environment so that people want to spend time in the place. The principles extend to the internal design and the spaces between buildings, as well as appearance of the buildings. Developments must be designed for diverse communities in Southwark and to ensure accessibility, inclusivity, and interaction, regardless of disability, age or gender, and allow all to participate equally, confidently and independently in everyday activities. 2. Southwark’s built environment reflects different periods of design and development and portrays a variety of local character. Some local character is unique with a distinct identity, while other areas have local character that is poorer or less defined. Further detail on local character can be found in our area visions, characterisation studies and conservation area appraisals. Research in the Old Kent Road area has shown that the character or ‘feel’ of neighbourhoods influences community cohesion and social interaction. 126 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 3. The public realm is the network of spaces, streets and paths between buildings. Good public realm design is essential to help people move around the borough as it improves the streetscape, and creates a sense of place with vibrant, pleasant environments that people will take pride in and enjoy. Provision of urban greening and green infrastructure can deliver multiple health, wellbeing and environmental benefits within buildings and the public realm, such as helping to reduce the urban heat island effect, where urban areas become significantly hotter than rural areas in summer, and the impact of surface water flooding, both of which will be exacerbated by climate change. It can also provide opportunities for recreation and food growing. Visible greenery or water and awareness of nature improve mental health. The enhancement of areas through urban greening can also help deliver economic growth and create healthier places by reducing air pollution and encouraging physical activity. 4. Good design of places and the public realm are important to promote active travel and encourage of these spaces for movement, which contributes to mitigating climate change by reducing carbon emissions. P14 Design quality Development must provide: 1. High standards of design including building fabric, function and composition; and 2. Innovative design solutions that are specific to the site’s historic context, topography and constraints; and 3. Adequate daylight, sunlight, outlook, and a comfortable microclimate including good acoustic design for new and existing residents; and 4. A positive response to the context using durable, quality materials; and 5. Buildings and spaces which are constructed and designed sustainably to adapt to the impacts of climate change; and 6. Buildings and spaces that utilise active design principles that are fitting to the location, context, scale and type of development; and 7. Active frontages and entrances that promote activity and successfully engage with the public realm in appropriate locations; and 8. Adequate servicing within the footprint of the building and site for each land use; and 9. Accessible and inclusive design for all; and 10. A positive pedestrian experience; and 11. Basements that do not have adverse archaeological, amenity or environmental impacts. Reasons 1. Good design is a key aspect of making places better for people. Southwark has some world-class developments that have raised its profile, and has a wealth of development opportunities which will continue to add to its reputation for modern and contextual design. Southwark has a range of different neighbourhoods and areas contributing to local distinctiveness, and this diversity will be reflected in new development. It is important that appropriate quality materials are used in development, as the right materials greatly contribute to the overall impression of a building, as well as how it relates to its area. 127 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 2. In addition to healthcare services, such as GPs and clinics, other environmental and social conditions are known to influence people’s health. Encouraging physical activity can help protect residents from diseases and mental health issues. The internal layout of buildings can be designed to encourage activity, for example, by making stairwells more attractive, visible and convenient to use. Locating benches, public toilets and water fountains along walking routes encourages people to use them. Active design can also help reduce energy consumption in buildings. 3. Sustainable design must reduce energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions, minimise the consumption of natural resources, reduce flood risk and pollution, ensure the avoidance of internal overheating, minimise the urban heat island effect, ensure the adaptive reuse of existing buildings, and avoid creation of adverse local climatic conditions (e.g. wind shear). This is crucial to adapt and mitigate against climate change. P15 Residential Design 1. Development must achieve an exemplary standard of residential design. 2. All new build and conversions to residential development must take into consideration the site context, the impact on the amenity of adjoining occupiers, and the quality of accommodation as follows: 1. Provide a high standard of quality of accommodation for living conditions; and 2. Be tenure blind; and 3. Provide no material differences in appearance between affordable and market homes in apartment blocks; and 4. Provide the opportunity for residents of all tenures to access on site facilities; and 5. Avoid having more than eight dwellings accessed from a single core per floor; and 6. Provide acceptable levels of natural daylight by providing a window in every habitable room, except in loft space where a roof light may be acceptable; and 7. Achieve a floor to ceiling height of at least 2.5 metres for at least 75 per cent of the Gross Internal Area of each dwelling to maximise natural ventilation and natural daylight in the dwelling; and 8. Be predominantly dual aspect and allow for natural cross ventilation; and 9. In circumstances where due to site constraints it is impossible or impractical to provide dual aspect dwellings it must be demonstrated how overheating and ventilation will be mitigated. Single aspect dwellings will not be acceptable if they have three or more bedrooms, or are north facing or where the façade is exposed to high noise levels; and 10. Meet the minimum national space standards set out in Table 6, or where relevant the Aylesbury Action Area Core space standards set out in Table 7, providing adequate internal space for the intended number of occupants, including the provision of additional built in storage as set out in Table 7; and 11. Provide private amenity space, communal amenity space and facilities for all residents, and child play space on site using the GLA calculator. Child play space should be on ground or low level podiums with multiple egress points; and 128 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 12. Provide equal access to outdoor space for all residents regardless of tenure; and 13. In the Old Kent Road opportunity area, provide 5sqm of public open space per dwelling in addition to the communal amenity space requirement. New open space must be provided in the locations identified on the Old Kent Road Area Action Plan masterplan. Sites where a new open space is not identified must provide a financial contribution instead; and 14. Provide communal facilities including gardens and community rooms. Provide green communal amenity space for all residents and additional communal play areas for children (aged up to 16) for apartments. Communal amenity space should be designed to provide multiple benefits (e.g. recreation, food growing, habitat creation, SUDS) and should be additional to external communal amenity space; and 15. In circumstances where private and communal amenity space and facilities or child play space cannot be provided on site, this should be provided as private amenity space with the remaining amount added to the communal space requirement; and, we will seek a financial contribution towards providing new or improving existing public open space or play space provision in the vicinity of the site; and 16. Maximise the use of sustainable technologies and materials; and 17. Complete a Whole Life-cycle Carbon Assessment for Major Referrable schemes for existing buildings and identify where materials can be recycled and reused. Reasons 1. Our aim is to ensure that all new homes are of an excellent standard of accommodation that will contribute to creating healthy and safe places where people of all ages want to live and can thrive. This is especially important for higher density schemes. 2. We believe all residents are entitled to the same quality homes irrespective of tenure. Our residents have told us it is important for communities that neighbours and visitors should not be able to tell the tenure of a home by its appearance. It is important that family housing provides private amenity space to ensure that children have somewhere safe to play or provides an outdoor space to dry clothes and to enjoy the outdoors. Communal play areas are important for children, parents and carers to exercise and get together. 3. Old Kent Road is an area of deficiency in public open space. The requirement for 5sqm of new public open space per home will help ensure that new space is provided to help meet the needs of the growing population and provide a benefit for existing communities. 129 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Fact Box: Dual Aspect – A flat that has been designed with openable windows on two external walls which may be opposite or around a corner. One access may be towards an external aspect deck, courtyard or ventilated atrium. Provision of a bay window, a single window return or a secondary window into a recessed balcony does not provide dual aspect. Communal amenity space - Flatted development must provide 50sqm of communal amenity space per residential block. Private amenity space - New houses must provide a minimum of 50 sqm private garden space. The garden should be at least 10m in length. Flatted developments must provide 10 sqm of private amenity space for units containing three or more bedrooms, For units containing two or less bedrooms, 10 sqm of private amenity space should be provided. Where this is not possible, as much space as possible should be provided as private amenity space, and the shortfall added to the communal amenity space requirement. Balcony space – an outside area must be a minimum of 5sqm and 1.5m deep to count towards private amenity space.

Windows that overlook places such as parks and streets, courtyards, parking areas and civic spaces to provide natural surveillance; and 2. Streets, pedestrian routes, footpaths and cycle paths that are easy to navigate with permeable, direct routes that provide good visibility and avoid sharp or blind corners, tunnels, and hidden alcoves; and 3. Clear and uniform signage that helps people move around, making the public realm and public transport safer and more attractive for people to use; and 4. Effective street lighting that illuminates the public realm, enabling natural surveillance and avoiding the creation of dark, shadowed areas; and 5. Clearly defined boundaries between public and private spaces that reduce the likelihood of anti-social behaviour by establishing ownership and responsibility; and 6. Security measures for buildings and places are proportionate to their use and function, considering the need to avoid creating places that are hostile or unwelcoming; and 7. Secured by Design principles. Reasons 1. Some neighbourhoods in Southwark have provided opportunities for higher levels of crime and a lack of ownership due to poor design. Southwark has significantly improved perception of crime in the built environment through some of the earlier phases of our estate regeneration programmes by applying “Secured by Design” principles. Small changes such as creating well lit, overlooked spaces can significantly reduce opportunities to commit crime as well as fear of crime. Creating and maintaining a safe environment is extremely important as people who live in, work in, or visit the borough, have a right to expect that they can move about without unreasonable concern for their safety and can feel safe in their homes. 2. It is also important to address the community’s ‘fear of crime’, whether this is a real or perceived threat, because this also influences people’s behaviour patterns and how they interact in public spaces. Encouraging physical activity to improve health and wellbeing and improving perceptions of safety will go hand-in-hand. Improving community safety involves designing the urban environment to enable people to feel proud of and use their local space. 132 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P17 Tall buildings 1. The areas where we expect tall buildings are shown on the adopted Policies Map and on Figure 4. These are typically within our Major Town Centres, Opportunity Area Cores, Action Area Cores and the Central Activities Zone. Individual sites where taller buildings may be appropriate have been identified in the site allocations. Some of these site allocations have identified possible locations for tall buildings in Peckham and Camberwell town centres taking account of conservation areas and other heritage assets. 2. Tall buildings must: 1. Be located at a point of landmark significance; and 2. Have a height that is proportionate to the significance of the proposed location and the size of the site; and 3. Make a positive contribution to the London skyline and landscape, taking into account the cumulative effect of existing tall buildings and emerging proposals for tall buildings; and 4. Not cause a harmful impact on strategic views, as set out in the London View Management Framework, or to our Borough views; and 5. Respond positively to local character and townscape; and 6. Provide a functional public space that is appropriate to the height and size of the proposed building; and 7. Provide a new publicly accessible space at or near to the top of the building and communal facilities for users and residents where appropriate. 3. The design of tall buildings will be required to: 1. Be of exemplary architectural design and residential quality; and 2. Conserve and enhance the significance of designated heritage assets and make a positive contributions to wider townscape character. Where proposals will affect the significance of a designated heritage asset (from its alteration or destruction, or from development within its setting) clear and convincing justification in the form of public benefits will be required; and 3. Avoid harmful and uncomfortable environmental impacts including wind shear, overshadowing, and solar glare; and 4. Maximise energy efficiency and prioritise the use of sustainable materials; and 5. Have a positive relationship with the public realm, provide opportunities for new street trees, and design lower floors to successfully relate to and create a positive pedestrian experience; and provide widened footways and routes to accommodate increased footfall. 133 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Reasons 1. Tall buildings, if thoughtfully designed to an exemplary architectural standard and located in the right place, can be an important component in contributing to Southwark’s physical regeneration, raising population density, creating new open space, avoiding urban sprawl and increasing the activities and life opportunities on offer for nearby residents. However, poorly designed or located tall buildings can look out of place in their surroundings, harm the setting of historic buildings and cause unpleasant environmental effects, especially to a location’s microclimate. Detailed modelling and analysis is therefore essential to assess these impacts, and is required for all tall building applications. 2. Well-designed tall buildings can add value to existing communities by ensuring that they provide benefits for all. Development that is designed in this way is considered “good growth” development, as it responds sensitively to local context and place-shaping opportunities, delivers new affordable homes and workspaces, has excellent sustainability and accessibility, and provides activities for people at ground level within a good microclimate. 3. Southwark’s tall building policy is underpinned by its urban characteristics and is a refinement of adopted policy and our strategic approach. This has resulted in the plan-led emergence of tall buildings and clusters at locations of landmark significance, in our Major Town Centres and regeneration areas, and in close proximity to our public transport stations and interchanges. 4. In accordance with the London Plan we have identified and mapped the locations where tall buildings would be an appropriate form of development in principle. This process is based on a re-appraisal of the visual, environmental, and cumulative impacts of tall buildings in Southwark, their potential to contribute to new homes, economic growth, and regeneration, and their level of public transport accessibility. 5. Southwark is an inner London borough that covers a range of areas defined by different urban characteristics, neighbourhoods, open spaces, and a variety of building types including Victorian terraces, housing estates, riverside flats and modern offices, some of which have significant historic value and are located within conservation areas or benefit from statutory listing. 6. The heights and scale of development differs greatly from the north through to the suburban, terraced houses and streets to the south of the borough. 7. The riverfront areas of Blackfriars Road, Bankside and London Bridge provide an established height for tall building clusters set back from the river with a number of prominent buildings visible on the skyline including One Blackfriars Road, Southbank Tower, Tate Modern and its extension, Guy’s Hospital Tower, London Bridge Place, and the Shard. The Shard which stands at 309.6m, has formed a new pinnacle within the existing cluster of tall buildings around London Bridge Station and Guy’s Hospital. This tall building has redefined the skyline of the area, making London Bridge a focus for new tall building development. Tall buildings are now established at the key junctions along Blackfriars Road. 134 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 8. Elephant and Castle is defined by a further cluster of tall commercial and residential buildings focused around train, tube and bus services and its importance as a Major Town Centre. Height will be located along main roads and key junctions within and into the town centre, with heights lowering to manage the transition down to the existing context. The regeneration of this area will see the redevelopment of the shopping centre to provide new homes, retail, commercial and civic spaces. 9. Emerging tall buildings in the Old Kent Road Opportunity Area are informed by a Stations and Crossings Strategy where the tallest buildings are proposed or have been consented at the most accessible locations within the Opportunity Area. 10. The significant, plan-led regeneration of Canada Water will add further tall buildings to a cluster that is focused around the new town centre, with heights lowering at the periphery. 11. Opportunities for taller buildings in the Aylesbury Action Area are focused on the main routes and their junctions, and sites adjacent to Albany Road and Burgess Park. General building heights are lower. 12. Building heights are generally low scale across Peckham with opportunities for some slightly taller buildings within town centre. The tallest new buildings in Peckham are restricted to the strategic development sites and should enhance local character and provide public realm opportunities. 13. Tall buildings can also be found in a number of other locations, generally in the form of residential towers in 1960s and 70s housing estates or located around the town centres, such as in East Walworth and Peckham. Fact Box: Tall buildings are above 30m except where they are 25m in the Thames Special Policy Area, and also where they are significantly higher than surrounding buildings or their emerging context. Taller Buildings: Taller buildings are generally higher than their surroundings context but are not significantly taller to qualify as tall buildings. Point of landmark significance: A point of landmark significance is where a number of important routes converge, where there is a concentration of activity and which is or will be the focus of views from several directions. 135 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 136 Southwark Plan 2022 View of the Shard Table of Contents Figure 4: Tall buildings map 137 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P18 Efficient use of land 1. Development will be permitted that: 1. Optimises land use; and 2. Does not unreasonably compromise development potential or legitimate activities on neighbouring sites; and 3. Provides adequate servicing facilities, circulation spaces and access to, from and through the site. 2. Development should be permitted for appropriate temporary ‘meanwhile uses’ where they deliver community benefits, do not harm amenity and do not compromise the future redevelopment of the site. Reasons Urban land is a vital, finite resource that must be efficiently used to reduce pressure on rural land and open spaces. Increasing density is a key requirement for the sustainable use of land. By increasing the number of people who visit, work and live in an area, more services and infrastructure can be supported thereby reducing the need to travel and contributing to the vitality of an area. However, densities that are too high could have a harmful impact on the environment and quality of life. Meanwhile uses are temporary uses on vacant land or in vacant buildings which can ensure that temporarily vacant buildings or land are efficiently used in a way that delivers community benefits and keeps an area vibrant. P19 Listed buildings and structures 1. Development relating to listed buildings structures and their settings will only be permitted if it conserves or enhances their special significance in relation to: 1. The historic fabric, architectural style and features, curtilage, site layout, plan form and readability, and land use; and 2. The contribution of the building to its setting or its place within a group; and 3. Views that contribute positively to the significance of the building or structure or their setting; and 4. The viable use of listed buildings and structures that is consistent with their on-going and long term conservation. 2. Any harm to the significance of the listed building or structure that results from a proposed development must be robustly justified. Reasons Heritage assets are irreplaceable and we recognise the importance of Southwark’s built heritage as an essential community asset. We will seek the conservation and enhancement of this asset as required by the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. Southwark has around 2,500 listed buildings which define local character, providing a sense of place and enrich the townscape. 138 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 139 Southwark Plan 2022 Grade II Listed Canal Grove Cottages, Old Kent Road Grade I Listed Building Southwark Cathedral, Borough Table of Contents P20 Conservation areas 1. Development relating to conservation areas will only be granted where it preserves or enhances the character or appearance of conservation areas and their settings, taking into account their significance, views into and out of the conservation area and its positive characteristics indentified in Conservation Area Appraisals and Conservation Area Management Plans. 2. The demolition of buildings or structures that make a positive contribution to the historic character and appearance of a conservation area will not generally be permitted. Any replacement buildings or structures must conserve and enhance the conservation area’s historic character and distinctiveness. 3. Any harm to the significance of the conservation area or its setting that results from a proposed development must be robustly justified. 4. Development relating to conservation areas will only be granted where it preserves or enhances the character or appearance of conservation areas and their settings, taking into account their significance, views into and out of the conservation area and its positive characteristics indentified in Conservation Area Appraisals and Conservation Area Management Plans. Reasons We recognise the importance of Southwark’s built heritage as a community asset and will seek the adequate safeguarding of this asset. These areas help define local character, provide a sense of place and enrich the townscape. The control of external appearances is important within conservation areas and where the quality of the environment is particularly high. Our published conservation area appraisals include detailed evaluations of the character and special features of each conservation area and provide additional supplementary guidance for developments affecting conservation areas. We are keen to encourage a high quality of design in conservation areas. This may include the use of modern materials or innovative techniques on new developments as they can sustain or enhance the character or appearance of the conservation area. P21 Conservation of the historic environment and natural heritage Development must: 1. Conserve and enhance the significance of the following designated and non-designated heritage assets and their settings: 1. Scheduled monuments; and 2. Sites of archaeological interest; and 3. Protected London squares; and 4. Registered parks and gardens; and 140 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 5. Trees within the curtilage of a listed building; and 6. Trees that contribute to the historic character or appearance of conservation areas; and 7. Trees that are subject to a Tree Preservation Order (TPO); and 8. Ancient hedgerows; and 9. Buildings and land with Article 4 (1) directions inside and outside conservation areas; and 10. Unlisted buildings of townscape merit; and 11. Undesignated heritage assets including Second World War Stretcher Fences; and 12. Foreshore and river structures. 2. Enable the viable use of the heritage asset that is consistent with its on-going and long term conservation; and 3. Provide robust justification for any harm to the significance of the heritage asset that results from the development. Reasons Southwark is home to a wide array of historic assets of local, regional and national importance. They help define our historic character, provide a sense of place and enrich the townscape. P22 Borough views Development should: 1. Preserve and where possible enhance the borough views of significant landmarks and townscape; and 2. Ensure the viewing locations for each view are accessible and well managed; and 3. Enhance the composition of the panorama across the borough and central London as a whole. View 1: The London panorama of St Paul’s Cathedral from One Tree Hill 1. Maintain the view of St Paul’s Cathedral from the viewing place on One Tree Hill and not exceed the threshold height of the view’s Landmark Viewing Corridor; and 2. Not compromise the sensitive Wider Assessment Area that is located either side of the Landmark Viewing Corridor to ensure the viewer’s ability to recognise and appreciate St Paul’s Cathedral and its setting is maintained. A canyon effect of the view of St Paul’s Cathedral must be avoided; View 2: The linear view of St Paul’s Cathedral from Nunhead Cemetery 1. Maintain the view of St Paul’s Cathedral from the viewing place within Nunhead Cemetery and not exceed the threshold height of the view’s Landmark Viewing Corridor; and 2. Not compromise the sensitive Wider Assessment Area that is located either side of the Landmark Viewing Corridor to ensure the viewer’s ability to recognise and appreciate St Paul’s Cathedral and its setting is maintained. A canyon effect of the view of St Paul’s Cathedral must be avoided; 141 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents View 3: The linear view of St Paul’s Cathedral along Camberwell Road 1. Maintain the view of St Paul’s Cathedral from the viewing place on Camberwell Road and not exceed the threshold height of the view’s Landmark Viewing Corridor; and 2. Not compromise the sensitive Wider Assessment Area that is located either side of the Landmark Viewing Corridor to ensure the viewer’s ability to recognise and appreciate St Paul’s Cathedral and its setting is maintained. A canyon effect of the view of St Paul’s Cathedral must be avoided; View 4: The river prospect of River Thames and its frontage, Tower Bridge and St Paul’s Cathedral from Kings Stairs Gardens 1. Ensure that the River Thames and its frontage, and the key landmarks of Tower Bridge and St Paul’s Cathedral are maintained within the view; View 5: The townscape view south from the centre of the Millennium Bridge 1. Ensure that the ability of the viewer to recognise and appreciate the strategic landmark of Tate Modern from the viewing location is maintained; 2. Annex 1 sets out the viewing locations and view geometry that relates to the borough views. Reasons Borough views are significant views and panoramas that make a positive contribution to experiencing Southwark’s environment within London, informing how we are located in an historic and important world city. Development that affects these borough views should provide Accurate Visual Representations (AVRs) to demonstrate the impact of the proposal on the borough views. 142 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 143 Southwark Plan 2022 View of St Paul’s Cathedral from Nunhead Cemetery Table of Contents Fact Box: Types of views London Panorama A panorama of central London across a substantial part of the borough. It also consists of a landmark viewing corridor with a focal point and a wider assessment area either side of the corridor. The corridor will influence development by defining a maximum permitted development threshold beneath the viewing plane of the corridor. A wider assessment area to either side of landmark viewing corridor will protect the sensitive edges of the corridor. This type of view is the same as London Panorama in the Mayor of London’s London View Management Framework (LVMF). Linear View A linear view of an urban object across a substantial part of the borough. It consists of a landmark viewing corridor with a focal point and a wider assessment area either side of the corridor. The corridor will influence development by defining a maximum permitted development threshold beneath the viewing plane of the corridor. A wider assessment area to either side of the landmark viewing corridor protects the sensitive edges of the corridor. This type of view is the same as London Panorama in the LVMF. River prospect A more localised river prospect townscape view of a particular panorama that is ‘sensitive’ to new height within the view. Townscape A more localised urban townscape view of a particular panorama that is ‘sensitive’ to new height within the view. More information about protected views and their role in planning and regeneration can be found in the LVMF. 144 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P23 Archaeology 1. Development must conserve the archaeological resources commensurate to its significance; and 2. Development must preserve archaeological remains of national importance in situ and preserve archaeological remains of local importance in situ unless the public benefits of the development outweigh the loss of archaeological remains. Where archaeological remains cannot be preserved in situ the remains must be excavated, recorded, archived, published, interpreted and displayed through a detailed planned programme of works. There may also be a requirement for a programme of public engagement, in order that the results of significant archaeological discoveries are disseminated. The scale of this public engagement will be based upon on the significance and interest of the findings, but may involve site visits for the public or other means of on and off site viewing; and 3. Development must consider the archaeological interest and significance of sites that lie outside of an APA. Sites outside APAs will be assessed against the historic environment record for Southwark. Requirements will be secured by condition where necessary. Reasons 1. Southwark has immensely rich, varied and important archaeological sites. Archaeological research has revealed prehistoric sites, with early settlement and land management on the higher and drier islands and well-preserved waterlogged structures and deposits surviving in the channels and lower-lying inter-tidal areas. Romans settled on the banks of the Thames after AD 43 and set up the Roman provincial capital Londinium which spanned both sides of the river and included northern parts of Southwark. During this period major roads were built from Southwark to other Roman towns in the south of England. 2. Archaeological evidence for the Saxon period is more difficult to detect, but the northern borough developed rapidly in the medieval period and post-medieval period. The historic road system, villages, parishes and parks further south and east also contain important archaeological information about the developing rural community of Southwark. The historic village cores of Peckham, Camberwell, Rotherhithe, Walworth and Dulwich, have the potential for the survival of archaeological remains from many periods. 3. There are currently six Archaeological Priority Areas (APAs) in Southwark. An APA is a defined area where there is significant known archaeological interest or particular potential for new archaeological discoveries. The designation of these areas is based on evidence held in the Greater London Historic Environment Record (GLHER), maintained by Historic England. Southwark’s APAs are: - APA1- North Southwark and Roman Roads - APA2 - Walworth Village 145 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents - APA3 - Camberwell Village - APA4 - Peckham Village - APA5 - Dulwich Village - APA6 - Lordship Lane Burial Mound 4. Planning applications affecting sites within Archaeological Priority Areas (APAs) will be accompanied by an archaeological assessment and a report on the results of a field evaluation of the site, including an assessment of the impact of the proposed development on the archaeological resource. The assessment should identify and describe the significance of the archaeological interest of the site, including any contribution made by the archaeological setting of the site. Any harm or loss of archaeological resource resulting from development will require justification. Fact Box: Archaeological Priority Area Tiers An Archaeological Priority Area (APA) is a defined area where, according to existing information, there is significant known archaeological interest or particular potential for new discoveries. Archaeological Priority Areas are categorised into one of three tiers (Tiers 1-3). The introduction of a ‘tiered’ system distinguishes those areas which are most significant from others which although still of interest are not quite so sensitive. The tiers provide a sound evidence base and practical appraisal tool for strategic planning, helping to identify sensitivities of sites in relation to APA’s. There are six Archaeological Priority Areas (APAs) in Southwark, of which one is classified Tier 1, and |five are Tier 2:|Col2|Col3| |||| |APA Tier|SScchheedduullee IIDD aanndd NNaammee|Former APA names| |Tier 1|APA1- North Southwark and Roman Roads|Combines fvi e former APAs into one large APA: • Borough, Bermondsey and Rivers • Bermondsey Lake • Kennington Road and Elephant and Castle • Old Kent Road • London to Lewes Road| |Tier 2|APA2- Walworth Village|Walworth Village| |Tier 2|APA3- Camberwell Village|Camberwell Green| |Tier 2|APA4- Peckham Village|Peckham Village| |Tier 2|APA5- Dulwich Village|Dulwich Village| |Tier 2|APA6- Lordship Lane Burial Mound|Newly designated APA| Tier 3- Following Historic England’s criteria, Southwark does not currently contain any Tier 3 designated priority areas. 146 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Tier 4 (outside APA)- In accordance with Historic England’s ‘Greater London Archaeological Priority Area Guidelines’ Tier 4 (outside APA) is any location that does not, on present evidence, merit inclusion within an Archaeological Priority Area, but may retain some potential of archaeological interest. Some Tier 4 sites have been identified in relevant site allocations. Tier 1 – an area defined of very high archaeological sensitivity This is an area known, or strongly suspected, to contain heritage assets of national importance (a Scheduled Ancient Monument or equivalent). The archaeology of Southwark is complex and the northern part of the Borough contains half of the Roman town of Londinium, therefore, in a similar fashion to the City of London, the northern and riverine zone of Southwark is defined as one large landscape scale Tier 1 APA, containing nine Scheduled Ancient Monuments (APA1). Tier 2- designated and non-designated assets considered of less than national importance This is a local area which the Greater London Historic Environment Record (GLHER) holds evidence indicating the presence or likely presence of heritage assets of archaeological interest. In Southwark Tier 2 APAs often cover our historic villages. London is a polycentric city made up of historic villages. The medieval cores of the villages of Walworth, Camberwell, Peckham and Dulwich are protected as Tier 2 APAs (APA2 to APA5). APA6 Lordship Lane Burial Mound is based upon historic map evidence that indicates a possibly prehistoric round barrow (man-made mound) may survive in this location. Tier 3- typically defined by geological, topographical or land use considerations in relation to known patterns of heritage asset distribution. This is a landscape-scale zone within which the GLHER holds evidence indicating the potential for heritage assets of archaeological interest. The definition of Tier 3 APAs involves using the GLHER to predict the likelihood that currently unidentified heritage assets, particularly sites of historic and archaeological interest, will be discovered in the future. Southwark does not currently have any designated Tier 3 APAs. Tier 4- outside APA Tier 4 is a label used by Historic England that applies to any locations that do not, on present evidence, fulfil the criteria to merit inclusion within an Archaeological Priority Area, but may retain some potential of archaeological interest. These would typically include large major developments such as those subject to Environmental Impact Assessment, and schemes involving demolition or substantial works to historic buildings, listed buildings or other designated heritage assets which have an archaeological interest (above and/or below ground). Outside Archaeological Priority Areas (that is in tier 4) most planning applications will not need an archaeological assessment but a few will. 147 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents The main excavaction area at Harper Road, Borough where a Roman sarcophagus and Roman buildings flanking the realigned course of the Roman road of Stane Street were discovered 148 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P24 World heritage sites 1. Development will only be permitted when the significance of the Outstanding Universal Value of World Heritage Sites and their settings are sustained and enhanced. This should include views into, out of and across sites. Reasons 1. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation recognises World Heritage Sites as internationally important with each having an inscription that details their Outstanding Universal Value. New development must consider the impact on the setting of the three World Heritage Sites that are located in central London. The three sites are: 1. Westminster Abbey, the Palace of Westminster and St Margaret’s Church; and 2. Tower of London; and 3. Maritime Greenwich. 2. Statements of Outstanding Universal Value and the management plans of the World Heritage Sites contain information on how the World Heritage Site is protected and managed. Tower Bridge with the Tower of London on the north of the river 149 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P25 River Thames 1. Development within the Thames Policy Area must: 1. Establish or continue the River Thames Path along the water frontage; and 2. Maintain the integrity and alignment of the riverbank and create new access points to the River Thames; and 3. Maintain and enhance the existing facilities that support and increase the use and enjoyment of the river and the activities associated with the Thames in the Thames Policy Area, including: 1. Access points to and alongside the river, including stairs, piers and the Thames Path; 2. Docks, including protection against partial or complete infilling; 3. Mooring facilities; 4. Facilities for passenger, freight and tourist traffic; 5. Sport and leisure facilities; 6. Heritage assets on the foreshore and within the river. 2. Integrate successfully with the water space in use, appearance and physical impact; and 3. Provide landmarks that are of historical, cultural and social significance along the river, including orientation points and pleasing views without causing undue harm to the cohesiveness of the water’s edge; and 4. Successfully relate scale, materials, colour and richness of detail, not only to direct neighbours but also to buildings on the opposite bank and those seen in the same context with the river, or within borough or London Views Management Framework views. This should take into account how the river meanders and the impact this can have on how buildings may be seen together. New tall buildings should be set at least one block back from the river bank; and 5. Maintain, remediate and improve flood defence walls for developments adjacent to the River Thames. Development adjacent to defences and culverts should demonstrate that their development will not undermine the structural integrity or detrimentally impact upon its intended operation; and 6. Avoid unacceptable harm or impacts on navigation, biodiversity, heritage assets or the existing character of the Thames Policy Area if proposing new mooring facilities; and 7. Not extend developed land, build over the river, or result in a continuous line of moored craft; and 8. Consider the use of the River Thames as an alternative means of transport during construction. Reasons The strategic importance and unique character of the River Thames needs to be maintained and enhanced to enable the use and enjoyment of the Thames for all. The River Thames and its hinterland comprise the Thames Policy Area. The Thames Policy Area makes an important historical and environmental contribution to Southwark and London enabling significant recreation, tourism, nature conservation and open space provision. This is a busy tourist area which is environmentally sensitive and subject to intense development pressure. Access and maintenance to the river is important to achieve this, along with the repair of and raising of the river defence wall and expansion of the pathway to incorporate drainage and flood mitigation. 150 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P26 Local list 1. Development must take into account locally listed buildings and structures that positively contribute to local character and amenity. 2. The criteria for a building to be locally listed are: 1. Age and rarity; and 2. Aesthetic value and landmark status; and 3. Group value; and 4. Historic, evidential, communal and social values; and 5. Archaeological interest; and 6. Designed landscaping. Reasons 1. Locally important buildings and views do not benefit from a statutory designation even though some of them can make a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness. 2. Further information on the Local List is set out in the Heritage SPD 2021. 151 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Best start in life P27 Education places 1. Development of educational facilities will be permitted where proposals provide pre-school, school, higher and further education places to meet identified needs and where there are sports, arts, leisure, cultural or community facilities that are shared with local residents and all members of the community. 2. Development should not lead to the loss of existing educational facilities unless there is re-provision in an area of identified need or they are surplus to requirements as demonstrated by pupil or student projections. 3. Where additional school places for new residents are needed, new school places must be provided. 4. Development of school places must provide sufficient floor space for teaching, halls, dining, physical education, staff and administration activities, storage, toilets and personal care, kitchen facilities, circulation, plant and any non-school or support functions such as special needs facilities. Schools must receive adequate daylight and sunlight, provide high quality external areas that avoid sightlines from neighbouring homes, have good internal and external air quality and support safe, healthy travel by pupils. Reasons 1. We will ensure that each development that takes place in Southwark maximises the potential for education places. It is important that we take the opportunity for education facilities to provide facilities for sports, leisure, culture and for events so that we can maximise opportunities for active, healthy lifestyles. 2. Education facilities should be made available for use by all members of the community when they are not needed by the education establishment, for example, out of school hours. This will encourage community interaction and active, healthy lifestyles. 152 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P28 Access to employment and training 1. Development incorporating: 1. 5,000sqm or more of gross new floorspace must provide training and jobs for local people in the construction stage; and 2. 2,500sqm or more of gross new non-residential floorspace must provide training and jobs for local people in the final development; and 3. 1,000sqm or more of gross new floorspace must allow local businesses to tender for the procurement of goods and services generated by the development both during and after construction. 2. In exceptional circumstances where jobs cannot be provided on site, a financial contribution will be required for construction employment and training. Reasons Employment and skills are key strategic priorities for the council and we support frontline programmes to help residents into work and promote a strong and inclusive local economy. It is our aspiration that all Southwark residents have employment that is fairly paid, underpinned by our promotion of the London Living Wage. We also want Southwark residents to have secure employment and the skills to progress beyond entry-level, insecure, low-paid work. This approach overcomes barriers to employment as it promotes a targeted approach to improve employment participation within Southwark and an entrepreneurial approach to business, especially amongst young people. Between 2014 and 2018, the Council has supported 5,811 residents into work through investment into Southwark Works and other targeted programmes, prioritising those residents furthest from the labour market. 1,918 apprenticeships have been created, through support for employers to create quality apprenticeships under the Southwark Apprenticeship Standard. We will look to repeat and improve on this success in our regeneration schemes in the coming years. Where jobs cannot be provided on site, financial contributions are secured through planning obligations in section 106 agreements. Funds from contributions for employment and skills outcomes are assigned across council programmes to support our residents into jobs and creating new apprenticeships. This is set out in more detail in the Section 106 and CIL Supplementary Planning Document. 153 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents A green and inclusive economy P29 Strategic protected industrial land 1. On strategic protected industrial land (SPIL) as shown on the Policies Map: 1. Only industrial uses (E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii), B2, B8, and sui generis industrial use classes) and uses ancillary to the industrial uses, will be permitted; and 2. Development must retain, grow or intensify industrial uses including increasing the number of jobs. 3. Industrial uses which fall within Use Class E(g)(ii) and (iii) will be secured, and where necessary retained through the implementation of conditions and/or planning obligations in accordance with the tests set out in national policy. 2. The area of SPIL which is host to the Integrated Waste Management Facility (IWMF) will be retained as SPIL unless the criteria of policy P63 are fulfilled. Reasons 1. Southwark is an important location for industrial servicing to central London and accommodating a wide range of industrial businesses. 32 hectares of land is identified as SPIL in Southwark in a number of industrial estates along the railway arches in Bermondsey and South Bermondsey, the Southwark Integrated Waste Management Facility and electricity substations, the Admiral Hyson Industrial Estate and the Glengall Road Business Estate. A further 20 hectares of land is identified as Locally Significant Industrial Sites including Mandela Way, Ossory Road, Hatcham Road and Ilderton Road where industrial development will be provided alongside new homes. 2. Sites in SPIL present opportunities to grow and intensify industrial uses as well as accommodating specific types of industry that are unable to be accommodated within mixed use developments. There are opportunities in South Bermondsey to intensify SPIL by providing multi-stacked industrial uses and making more effective use of land. SPIL provides land suitable for general and light industrial uses, logistics, waste management and environmental industries, utilities, wholesale markets, transport functions and sui generis uses that are inappropriate in residential areas. Many SPIL locations also provide opportunities to activate and enliven railway arches providing new types of employment space to help generate jobs. For the SPIL which is host to the IWMF, if the criteria of policy P63 is met the council will plan and coordinate the site for mixed use development as part of the Old Kent Road Area Action Plan. 3. Much of the industrial land in the borough is located in the Old Kent Road Opportunity Area. Many of the Old Kent Road site allocations designated for mixed use development as well as the sites designated as LSIS will be intensified for residential and industrial co-location. Development will include an innovative new approach to create new town centres which include community facilities, retail, office, education and health uses. Industrial development will be included alongside or underneath new homes with specific design criteria to ensure businesses can operate successfully without harming residential amenity. 154 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P30 Office and business development 1. In the Central Activities Zone, town centres, opportunity areas and individual development plots within site allocations where employment re-provision is required, development must: 1. Retain or increase the amount of employment floorspace on site (Gross Internal Area (GIA) of E(g), B2, B8 class use or sui generis employment generating uses); and 2. Promote the successful integration of homes and employment space in physical layout and servicing in areas that will accommodate mixed use development. This will include a range of employment spaces including freight, logistics, light industry, co-working, maker spaces and offices; and 3. Provide a marketing strategy for the use and occupation of the employment space to be delivered to demonstrate how it will meet current market demand. 2. In exceptional circumstances the loss of employment floorspace may be accepted in the Central Activities Zone, town centres, opportunity areas and where specified in site allocations where the retention or uplift in employment floorspace on the site is not feasible. This must be demonstrated by a marketing exercise for two years immediately prior to any planning application. This should be for both its existing condition and as an opportunity for an improved employment use through redevelopment which shows there is no demand. 3. Development that results in a loss of employment floorspace anywhere in the borough must provide a financial contribution towards training and jobs for local people. 4. Employment uses required by this policy (Use Class E(g)) will be secured and where necessary, retained through the implementation of conditions and/or planning obligations in accordance with the tests set out in national policy. Reasons 1. Southwark is home to a rich and diverse range of businesses providing jobs that help boost the local economy and contribute to the success of London as a world city. Southwark has seen strong and rapid growth in employment over the last decade which continues to grow and thrive. Development will help to supply new and adaptable workspaces across the borough to accommodate this demand, including new office space, light industry and creative businesses. We expect development to grow the number of jobs, resources, knowledge and innovation in a range of sectors. To meet growing demand, Southwark needs to deliver significant growth of around 460,000 sqm of new office space (2014-2036) which will be concentrated in the Central Activities Zone and town centre locations. Along with other types of employment space, this will provide 84,000 new jobs between 2014 and 2036. In our central London site allocations we are requiring an uplift in employment space to help meet this growing demand. In our opportunity areas, mixed use neighbourhoods will incorporate new types of flexible business workspace accommodating manufacturing, technology, science, creative and cultural industries and the digital economy helping to boost the number of jobs in the borough. Non-designated industrial sites as defined in specific site allocations provide scope for intensification of industrial or other employment uses to meet current market demand and where they are co-located with new homes. 2. We want to promote the creation of new jobs whilst ensuring that there is a supply of sites and premises for businesses to grow. The retention and growth of existing small and medium enterprises will support jobs to remain in Southwark and allow established businesses to prosper alongside new uses. 155 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P31 Affordable Workspace 1. Development must: 1. Retain small and independent businesses (E(g) B class uses). Where existing small and independent businesses are at risk of displacement from a development there should be full consideration of the feasibility of providing affordable and suitable space for existing occupiers in the completed development. Replacement business space should be like for like in terms of floorspace or bespoke to suit the requirements of the business; or 2. Explore the opportunities for long term management of employment space and the delivery of affordable workspace by workspace providers. 2. Developments proposing 500sqm GIA or more employment floorspace must: 1. Deliver at least 10% of the proposed gross employment floorspace as affordable workspace on site at discount market rents; and 2. Secure the affordable workspace for at least 30 years; 3. Provide affordable workspace of a type and specification that meets current local demand; and 4. Prioritise affordable workspace for existing small and independent businesses occupying the site that are at risk of displacement. Where this is not feasible, affordable workspace must be targeted for small and independent businesses from the local area with an identified need; and 5. Collaborate with the council, local businesses, business associations relevant public sector stakeholders and workspace providers to identify the businesses that will be nominated for occupying affordable workspace. 3. If it is not feasible to provide affordable workspace on site, an in lieu payment will be required for off site affordable workspace. This will be calculated using the Affordable Workspace Calculator. 4. Affordable workspace will be secured, and where necessary retained as employment uses through the use of planning obligations/ conditions in accordance with the tests set out in national policy. 5. In exceptional circumstances affordable retail, affordable cultural uses, or public health services which provide a range of affordable access options for local residents, may be provided as an alternative to affordable workspace (employment uses). This will only be acceptable if there is a demonstrated need for the affordable use proposed and with a named occupier. If the alternative affordable use is no longer required in the future, the space should be made available for affordable workspace (employment uses) in accordance with the criteria above. The reprovision or uplift of employment floorspace must still be provided in the scheme overall. Reasons 1. Southwark is home to a diverse range of businesses. We require development proposals to take the needs of existing occupiers into account to support the ongoing success of small businesses and local employment opportunities. Small and independent businesses make up the majority of businesses in Southwark providing jobs for local people and opportunities for business start-ups and self-employment. 97% of businesses in Southwark are firms which employ less than 50 people. These businesses are vital to the Southwark economy and are vulnerable to displacement by other uses and therefore need protection. It is important that units are affordable and flexible and designed to meet the needs of local businesses. The management of small 156 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents business units by specialist workspace providers will help ensure the success and long term retention of the space. 2. Developers will need to ensure the physical layout of mixed use developments can support a range of commercial uses appropriate to the type of commercial use planned for or appropriate to that area. This will include a range from freight/logistics and maker spaces to small business and office space. This will ensure a diverse and robust employment base. Affordable workspace offers support for start-ups, small or independent businesses which is vital to secure the future of Southwark’s thriving economy. There are a number of ways affordable workspace can be secured in new development schemes that is appropriate to the type and scale of workspace provided. Existing businesses that may be displaced or require relocation would receive priority for the affordable workspace delivered on site. 3. In the northern part of the borough, including the Central Activities Zone, Elephant and Castle and Canada Water demand for office space is high. New start-up businesses and small creative businesses in sectors such as technology, digital and marketing are likely to thrive in managed office workspace environment with flexible leases and affordable rents. 4. In the south and central part of the borough, including Old Kent Road, Camberwell and Peckham, demand for creative workspace including industrial maker spaces, light manufacturing and artists workspace remains high. Workspace focused and mixed use development is needed to deliver workspace that responds to this demand. 5. The policy applies to all new build developments providing over 500sqm of new employment floorspace regardless of any existing employment uses that will be demolished. For extensions to buildings or changes of use, the policy applies to the new floorspace created if the extension or change of use is over 500sqm. 6. The Affordable Workspace Calculator is the tool to calculate payments in lieu where it is not possible to provide affordable workspace on site. Payments are then calculated on a site specific basis including the following inputs: |Total net lettable employment fol orspace (relevant efef ctive RICS property measurement professional standards and guidance applies)|Square feet| ||| |Percentage of workspace to be afof rdable workspace|Percentage| |Expected market rent|Pounds per square foot| |Market investment yield|Percentage| |Discount to market rent|Percentage| 157 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Figure 5: Affordable workspace demand map 158 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Fact box: Small business: A business operating with 50 employees or less. Independent business: A business operating on no more than 3 sites. Business incubator: Workspace to support new and start-up businesses. Typically, business support and discount market rents would be offered to new businesses and staircased over 5 years to reflect the continued growth of the business. After 5 years the business will be supported to move on and the incubator space becomes available for new businesses to move in. Business incubators can be accommodated in stand-alone affordable units or within a workspace provider model. Discount market rents: A rent that is less than the market rent. Workspace provider: A workspace provider is a specialist public, private or not-for-profit organisation which provides and manages offices or flexible workspaces for entrepreneurs, small businesses, artists and sole traders. The space provided will often promote co-working, including shared facilities and offer low cost and flexible lease terms or pay- as-you-go hot desking. Workspace providers are a vital tool to deliver affordable workspace to support existing businesses and start-ups. Workspace providers may also offer business support and flexible terms to suit a wide range of business needs. Workspace providers operate on different scales from approximately 500sqm to 2,500sqm. Workspace provider with affordable element: A workspace provider may be appropriate to manage all workspace within an employment use or mixed use development. The 10% requirement could be integrated as part of this model. Affordable workspace provider: A not-for-profit or low cost workspace provider offering genuinely affordable rents for businesses to thrive. Specialist workspace provider: A provider that manages workspace for specialist business sectors, for example artist studios, creative industries or light industrial workspace. Affordable workspace occupier: An occupier from a specific sector that has a social, cultural or economic development purpose. This would include charities, public health services, voluntary and community organisations or social enterprises; creative and artists’ workspace; rehearsal and performance space and makerspace; occupiers for disadvantaged groups starting up in any sector; occupiers in support of educational outcomes through connections to schools, colleges or higher education; existing businesses in Southwark who need to relocate; small businesses located in Southwark; and start-ups or small businesses otherwise identified by the workspace provider to be agreed with the council. Workspace Provider List for Southwark: The council has established this list which responds to the increased demand for small, flexible and managed workspace following a detailed application and screening process. This list will be regularly updated and help developers plan for workspace provision early in the application process. 159 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Individual affordable workspace units: Purpose-built and designed small units (40-80sqm) offered at discounted market rents with a full fit-out which are suitable for supporting creative enterprises and small and independent businesses. Specialist individual affordable workspace units: Purpose-built units offered at discount market rents designed to a specification to support existing businesses or makerspaces, creative industries or light industrial workspace. In lieu payments: This is a charge payable on the basis of the equivalent level of affordable workspace that would be expected to be delivered on site. This payment will be used to deliver council-led initiatives for the delivery of affordable workspace across the borough. Scobel Clothing at Space Studios on Haymerle Road 160 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P32 Small shops 1. Development must retain small shops where existing small shops are at risk of displacement from a development. There should be full consideration of the feasibility of providing affordable and suitable space for existing occupiers in the completed development. Replacement shops should be like for like in terms of floorspace or bespoke to suit the requirements of the business, including provision of storage and servicing space. 2. Developments proposing 2,500 sqm GIA or more of retail space shall provide at least 10% of this space as small shops. 3. Small shops (Use Class E(a) and F.2(a)) will be secured through the implementation of conditions and/or planning obligations which will restrict change of use within Use Class E. Reasons To maximise diversity and consumer choice within town centres a range of shop unit sizes should be provided in large retail developments, suitable to accommodate a range of occupiers such as large multiple stores as well as independent and small shops. This will also help to mitigate impacts on retail businesses which are displaced as a result of development and help to ensure that town centres continue to reflect the character and diversity of the local population. The range of shop units will contribute to health and wellbeing by encouraging affordable destinations for social interaction within walking distance. Retaining small shops in town centres will help to prevent the amalgamation of shops into larger units and ensure a diversity of trade and independent businesses to serve the local population. Fact box: Small shop: A market stall or shop measuring less than 80sqm GIA in floorspace (excluding storage). 161 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P33 Business relocation 1. Where existing small or independent businesses or small shops may be displaced by development a business relocation strategy, written in consultation with affected businesses, must be provided. The business relocation strategy must set out viable relocation options. 2. All business relocation strategies must include: 1. Existing amount of non-residential floorspace (GIA) separated by use class, including vacant units and yards. This should include any floorspace demolished; and 2. Schedule of existing businesses operating on the site including business sector, estimated number of employees and lease terms; and 3. Proposed levels of non-residential floorspace (GIA) and yard space, separated by use class, business sector and estimated number of employees; and 4. Details of engagement with existing businesses on site regarding re-provision of premises or relocation options; and 5. Details of engagement with the council, local agents, businesses, business associations and workspace providers to secure occupiers for new employment space. 3. Where existing businesses are accommodated in new development the strategy should include: 1. Specific business requirements including servicing, fit out and ownership or lease terms; and 2. Temporary relocation arrangements or scheme phasing to allow the continuation of the business during construction. Temporary relocation should be contained on site or as close to the original site as possible; and 3. Options for temporary relocation should consider the cost and practical arrangements for businesses where multiple moves may not be feasible. 4. Where existing businesses are proposed to be relocated the strategy should include: 1. Reasons why existing businesses cannot be located on site; and 2. Details of relocation options explored with individual businesses and the assistance and support that will be provided. Statements from the businesses are required to show evidence that the relocation option is suitable for the viable continuation of the business; and 3. Identification of alternative premises in Southwark. Where no suitable premises exist, premises should be identified in adjacent boroughs; and 4. Statements from existing businesses should they wish to cease trading rather than relocate; and 5. Collaboration with other landowners to establish whether suitable workspace for existing businesses could be accommodated in different phases of the development programmes. 162 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Reasons 1. Small and independent businesses and small shops are a vital part of the prosperous local economy in Southwark and are made up of a wide range of innovative and inspiring enterprises, helping to boost local employment and the distinctive character of local neighbourhoods. Regeneration will help to increase the provision of small business space, particularly in new mixed use neighbourhoods. However it is important to ensure that any existing businesses are carefully considered in redevelopment schemes, either to be re provided where phasing allows, or to be relocated in Southwark to ensure the borough retains its local talent and commercial creativity. 2. Small and independent businesses are more vulnerable than larger companies and multiples and are unlikely to have the corporate resources available to seek specialist advice on relocation and mitigate the risks to the business. This places a disproportionate burden on small enterprises and may affect the overall viability of their business. Therefore it is appropriate that additional support is given to small businesses that may be affected by redevelopment. P34 Railway arches Development within railway arches must: 1. Provide commercial or community activities. No residential uses will be permitted and 2. Provide industrial uses in Strategic Protected Industrial Land; and 3. Promote the delivery of Low Line walking routes by providing active frontages and safe and accessible spaces for pedestrians. Reasons There are over 800 railway arches in Southwark stretching from London Bridge to Bermondsey, Peckham and Herne Hill. We support and encourage creative and vibrant uses within our historic railway arches, as they are economical spaces to rent and well suited to ‘incubating’ smaller businesses and helping them to grow. They also add character and are interesting places for shops, cultural, creative and community uses and restaurants. 163 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P35 Town and local centres 1. Development must: 1. Ensure main town centre uses including markets, community, civic, leisure and cultural uses are located in town centres and local centres; and 2. Be of a scale and nature that is appropriate to the role and catchment of the centre; and 3. Retain retail floorspace or replace retail floorspace with an alternative use that provides a service to the general public, and would not harm the vitality and viability of the centre; and 4. Not harm the amenity of surrounding occupiers or result in a concentration of uses that harms the vitality, viability and economic growth of the centre; and 5. Provide an active use at ground floor in locations with high footfall; and 6. For large schemes for main town centre uses that are 1,000 sqm (gross GIA) or more provide free public toilets, public drinking fountains and public seating. Public toilets may be provided either on or off site and not reserved for customer use only. 2. On new development in the Central Activities Zone, Opportunity Areas, Action Area Cores, Major and District Town Centres, retail uses (Use Class E(a), (b), (c)) will be secured through the implementation of conditions and/or planning obligations which will restrict change of use within Use Class E. Reasons 1. Southwark’s town centres are the central meeting places for residents to socialise, spend their leisure time, go shopping and go to school or places of work. It is important to ensure that we maintain our town centres as lively and interesting places. Each town centre has a unique identity that helps create a sense of place for residents and visitors alike, providing unique qualities and world-class facilities such as shops, cultural and entertainment venues that help the town centres to prosper and flourish. 2. Town and local centres should be the main focus for new developments providing new shops, education, healthcare and community facilities, offices and workspaces, leisure facilities and entertainment venues. This includes encouraging a diverse night-time economy with a range of appropriate activities throughout the evening and night time. Our aim is to expand shopping space in our town centres particularly at Elephant and Castle including Walworth Road, Canada Water, Old Kent Road and Peckham which have the most potential for growth. Other activities and uses, such as offices, community facilities, cultural uses and new homes will also help make Southwark’s town centres more vibrant and independent, which will reduce the amount of trips people need to make to reach their local services and jobs. 3. Providing free public toilets, drinking fountains and seating will help ensure town centres are accessible for people of all ages. This will benefit health and wellbeing by encouraging more walking within town centres and allowing more people to benefit from the activities on offer. Increasing social interaction in town centres by encouraging people to linger can help protect against loneliness, unhappiness and mental illness for people of all ages and walks of life. 4. Southwark’s town centres are places to feel a sense of belonging, provide facilities for local residents and 164 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents contain shops and workspaces that boost the local economy. A range of sizes of our town centres including local centres help to provide local shops and services in close proximity to all our residential neighbourhoods. We want to reduce the number of cars in town centres to create more pedestrian friendly environments that are supported by ease of access to public transport and cycling. 165 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Table 8: Town and Local Centres |Designation Major Town Centres|Town centre Elephant and Castle (including Walworth Road) Peckham Canada Water| ||| |District Town Centres|Bankside and The Borough London Bridge Camberwell Lordship Lane Herne Hill Old Kent Road north Old Kent Road south| |Local Centres|The Blue Dulwich Village Nunhead Tower Bridge Road| Fact Box: The Town Centre Hierarchy Major centres: Major centres generally contain over 50,000 sqm of retail, leisure and service floorspace with a relatively high proportion of comparison goods relative to convenience goods. They may also have significant employment, leisure, service and civic functions. District centres: District centres provide convenience goods and services for more local communities and are accessible by public transport, walking and cycling. Typically they contain 10,000 – 50,000 sqm of retail, leisure and service floorspace. Local centres: Local centres typically serve a localised catchment often most accessible by walking and cycling and include local parades and small clusters of shops, mostly for convenience goods and other services. They may include a small supermarket (typically up to around 500 sqm), sub-post office, pharmacy, laundrette and other useful local services. Together with District centres they can provide local retail and other services. 166 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Row of shops in Rye Lane, Peckham P36 Development outside town centres Development providing main town centre uses outside town and local centres must comply with the sequential test. Large development proposals, over 1,000 sqm (gross) will require an impact assessment and demonstrate that they would not harm the vitality and viability of centres or planned investment in centres. Fact Box: Main town centre uses: Retail development (including warehouse clubs and factory outlet centres); leisure, entertainment and more intensive sport and recreation uses (including cinemas, restaurants, drive-through restaurants, bars and pubs, nightclubs, casinos, health and fitness centres, indoor bowling centres and bingo halls); offices; and arts, culture and tourism development (including theatres, museums, galleries and concert halls, hotels and conference facilities). Reasons Town and local centres should be the main focus for new developments for main town centre uses. The sequential test requires that main town centre uses should be located in town centres, then in edge of centre locations; and only if suitable sites are not available (or expected to become available within a reasonable period) should out of-centre sites be considered. A large development of 1,000 sqm could equal or exceed the need for shopping floorspace in some areas and therefore could have a significant detrimental impact on the vitality and viability of nearby centres. 167 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P37 Protected shopping frontages In Protected Shopping Frontages, development must: 1. Provide active ground floor uses which provide a service to the general public, that would not harm the vitality and viability of the shopping frontage. Reasons Shopping is the main reason for visiting the borough’s centres and it is important that we maintain high proportions of shops and prevent them from being changed to other uses which would erode the quality and variety of our main shopping parades. In secondary and CAZ shopping frontages, whilst shops are important, there is a greater diversity of activities and services. Maintaining a healthy balance of uses in these locations is vital to protecting the vitality and viability of our centres. P38 Shops outside protected shopping frontages, town and local centres Development must not result in the loss of shops outside Protected Shopping Frontages, Town and Local Centres. In exceptional circumstances a change may be permitted where: 1. There is no market demand for the shop use. This must be demonstrated by a marketing exercise for two years, immediately prior to any planning application, for both its existing condition and as an opportunity for an improved shop; and 2. Evidence is provided that there are alternative shops within a 400 metre walking distance. Reasons Outside town centres, local centres and protected shopping frontages, local shops and other local services should be safeguarded and supported to meet the day-to-day needs of residents. They can provide a convenient service to help to make people feel part of a community and do their shopping with minimal travel. 168 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P39 Shop fronts Development affecting shop fronts and shop front signage must: 1. Ensure the proportion, scale, style, detailing, colour and materials make a positive contribution to the building and its context; and 2. Retain and refurbish existing traditional and historic shop fronts and features when located within heritage assets, conservation areas or the setting of heritage assets; and 3. Be adequately and appropriately lit for its context; and 4. Utilise internal security grilles and security solutions; and 5. Retain or provide a shop window if part of a change of use within town centres. Reasons Southwark’s town centres and local shopping parades have evolved from historic village centres over hundreds of years. The retention of historic shop fronts and the provision of well designed new shop fronts encourage a welcoming environment. Shop fronts and signage make important contributions to the appearance of our town centres and shopping parades. However, some new shop fronts or alterations to existing shop fronts can harm visual amenity and local character with poor quality design, materials, signage and security shutters. P40 Betting shops, pawnbrokers and pay day loan shops Development of betting shops, pay loan shops and pawnbrokers must: 1. Be located within a protected shopping frontage; and 2. Not exceed more than 5% of the total number of betting shops, pay day loan shops and pawnbrokers within the protected shopping frontage; and 3. Be at least 10 premises away from other premises of the same use. Reasons There is concern in the local community about the impact of the clustering of betting shops, pawnbrokers and pay day loan shops on the vitality and viability of Southwark’s shopping frontages, town centres and high streets. The clustering of these shops can have a disproportionate impact on the health outcomes of the most deprived communities in Southwark, and those at risk of problem gambling. There are a number of health outcomes associated with betting shops and pay day loan shops, including poor physical and mental health, fatigue, obesity, co-dependence on alcohol and affected interpersonal relationships. A high density of these shops can worsen these health inequalities and limit the ability for residents to participate in health promoting activities. Too many of these shops can also lead to a perception that a town centre’s retail offer is weak and that it is in decline. 169 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P41 Hotels and other visitor accommodation 1. Development for hotels and forms of visitor accommodation must ensure the design, scale, function, parking and servicing arrangements respond positively to local character and protect the amenity of the local community and visitors to the hotel. 2. A minimum of 10% of the total floorspace must be provided as ancillary facilities in hotel developments that incorporate a range of publicly accessible daytime uses and offer employment opportunities. Reasons Southwark welcomes new hotels new hotels, particularly those which contribute to employment growth and offer employment opportunities for local people. We have delivered one of the highest numbers of hotel rooms in London to meet London’s visitor accommodation needs and demand for hotels continues to grow in central London. Proposals that also incorporate a range of day time activities which provide additional employment floorspace will be considered favourably as they provide additional employment and encourage more use of buildings by residents, workers and visitors. Such uses may include hotel receptions, café and restaurants, conference facilities and meeting rooms, salons and other ancillary supporting space that can be made available for use by the local community as well as visitors staying at the hotel. 170 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P42 Pubs 1. Pubs must be protected from development resulting in a change of use or loss of the pub. In exceptional circumstances, development proposals resulting in the loss of a pub will only be permitted where there is no market demand for the pub use. This needs to be demonstrated by a marketing exercise for two years, immediately prior to any planning application, for both its existing condition and as an opportunity for improved pub use at market rates. 2. Alterations leading to a loss of cellarage, other functional or ancillary space or changes to a pub that make it unviable will not be permitted. 3. Where a change of use is acceptable, development must retain the design, character and heritage value of the building where it makes a positive contribution to streetscape and local character. 4. The registration or nomination of a pub as an Asset of Community Value will be treated as a significant material consideration. Reasons 1. Pubs make a strong contribution to the historic character and social fabric of an area, particularly through their architectural features and historical and cultural connections. Pubs also make a strong contribution to Southwark’s vibrant and diverse night-time economy. The number of pubs across London has been declining and they are at risk of conversion or demolition. Southwark has lost a third of its pubs in the period 2007-2017, this represents 79 pubs lost in the borough with 164 public houses remaining. A number have changed into other commercial uses and have lost their appearance and usage as a public house. Nevertheless there is still a market for pubs given the right management and sales offer. 2. Pubs provide a positive economic role in contributing to the vibrancy and vitality of shopping areas. Pubs that have been designated as Assets of Community Value are recognised by local residents and the council as having an important place and role within our communities. Lord Nelson Pub, Old Kent Road 171 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P43 Outdoor advertisments and signage Advertisement Consent for outdoor advertisements and signage must: 1. Avoid unacceptable harm to public amenity. Advertisements and signage should be designed so that their size, scale, type and illumination are unobtrusive, taking into account site context and local character; and 2. Avoid harm to the significance of streetscape and heritage assets or their settings; and 3. Not compromise safety and security or obscure highway sightlines and allow free movement along the public highway by all users, including people with disabilities, especially the visually impaired; and 4. Not adversely impact on trees on or in close proximity to the proposed site, especially those protected by Tree Protection Orders (TPOs) or within conservation areas. Reasons Signage is essential to the economy and often provides necessary and important information. Signage can have a disproportionate impact on the environment and must be carefully controlled to avoid detriment to the streetscape. The increasing use of hoardings can cause adverse effects but, in some circumstances, can be positively used around construction sites to add interest and colour on a temporary basis. As many signs are located within or beside the highway, care must also be taken to ensure that safety and free movement on the highway is protected. The use of low energy lighting will play an important role in addressing climate change. P44 Broadband and digital infrastructure Major development must: 1. Enable the delivery of fibre to the premises (FTTP) broadband or equivalent technology for future occupants and users of the proposed development, with superfast speeds being the minimum offered; and 2. Provide FTTP, or equivalent, connections to existing, poorly serviced properties in the vicinity of the development where there is an identified need; and 3. Engage with UK mobile network operators (MNOs) and digital infrastructure providers regarding the installation of wireless broadband and telecommunications aerials. Digital infrastructure development must: 1. Be designed and sited to avoid harmful impacts on public amenity or unacceptable street clutter in the public realm; and 2. Avoid harm to the significance of heritage assets or their settings and support local distinctiveness; and 3. Demonstrate an absence of alternative sites, including, but not only, the possibility of sharing of existing masts and sites; and 4. Provide self-certification to the effect that a mobile phone base station when operational will meet the 172 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNRP) guidelines; and 5. Provide a statement for each site indicating its location, the height of the antenna, the frequency and modulation characteristics and details of power output and where a mobile phone base station is added to an external mast or site, confirmation that the cumulative exposure will not exceed the ICNRP guidelines. Reasons Digital connectivity is an important utility. Effective communications networks are vital in the efficient operation of business and home life, and have benefits for safety and security. Ofcom currently defines superfast broadband as being a minimum download speed of 30 megabits per second (Mbit/s), which is a measure of data transfer speed. The government is prioritising creating and funding demand for full fibre broadband networks which will greatly enhance business opportunities. High speed broadband can help businesses, including SMEs, to increase efficiencies and work in partnership with others, thereby realising their full economic potential and driving jobs and economic growth. They can also help residents to access information, products and services more easily. Southwark has some areas with low or poor digital connectivity: according to Ofcom’s ‘Connect Nations Update: Summer 2019 7% of Southwark premises are unable to receive a minimum download speed of 30Mbit/s (9923 premises, compared with 5% nationally. We seek to improve these statistics and promote Southwark as a digitally inclusive borough. This is important for social regeneration as it benefits residents and businesses. Applicants should work with the council, MNOs and broadband delivery partners to find an appropriate solution for delivering FTTP broadband or equivalent connections to occupiers of new development and the surrounding existing properties where necessary and feasible. However, poorly sited digital infrastructure installations can be unsightly in particular when situated close to historic buildings or places. 173 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Healthy, active lives P45 Healthy developments 1. Development must: 1. Be easily accessible from the walking and cycling network; and 2. Provide, or support opportunities for healthy activities; and 3. Retain or re-provide existing health, community, sport and leisure facilities. 2. Development will be permitted where it provides new health, community, sport and leisure facilities. 3. In exceptional circumstances, health, community and leisure facilities can be replaced by another use where there are currently more facilities than needed. This must be demonstrated by a marketing exercise for two years, immediately prior to any planning application. This should be for both its existing condition and as an opportunity for an improved health, community or leisure space at market rates. Reasons We will ensure that each development that takes place in Southwark maximises the potential for healthy lifestyle choices. Provision of facilities for leisure, health, and places for people to meet up and socialise are essential to living a healthy and active life. This type of development will make it as easy as possible to reduce social isolation, poor mental health, obesity and inactivity. The retention or provision of sports facilities is considered on a borough wide basis. P46 Leisure, arts and culture 1. Development must: 1. Retain or re-provide existing leisure, arts and cultural uses. Reprovision should be of the same, or be better than, the quantity and quality of existing uses; or 2. In exceptional circumstances leisure, arts and cultural facilities can be replaced by another use where there are currently more facilities than needed. This must be demonstrated by a marketing exercise for two years, immediately prior to any planning application. This should be for both its existing condition and as an opportunity for an improved leisure, arts or cultural facility at market rates; and 3. An Equalities Impact Assessment will be required for any proposed loss of community facilities in predominant use by protected characteristic communities as defined by the Equality Act 2010; and 4. The registration or nomination of leisure, art and cultural uses as an Asset of Community Value will be treated as a significant material consideration. 174 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 2. Development will be permitted where: 1. New leisure, arts and cultural uses are provided; and 2. It delivers or supports the delivery of public art projects, independent museums and theatres; and 3. New arts and cultural venues of strategic significance are proposed within the South Bank Cultural Quarter, Elephant and Castle Cultural Quarter, Old Kent Road and Canada Water Opportunity Area Cores and Peckham and Camberwell Creative Enterprise Zone. Reasons 1. Southwark is a creative place to live, work and learn because there is such a thriving leisure, arts and cultural sector. This is why people come to Southwark, and contributes to why it is a successful and desirable place to live, work and visit. The borough is host to over 10 unique, internationally renowned cultural venues which are firmly rooted in, and sprung from the borough’s resident and business populations. The people of Southwark value what their neighbourhoods have to offer and venues like these enable individuals, and communities to come together and participate in our rich, historic and contemporary cultural offer. Building on these strengths, a vibrant arts, leisure and cultural scene will bring employment, engage local people and visitors, and create opportunities for training and learning. 2. Southwark has a history of great public art and projects that contribute to our world renowned cultural offer, our burgeoning creative economy and cultural wellbeing. We recognise the important role that public art projects have in making Southwark a more interesting and enjoyable place to live, work and visit. Its social and cultural qualities can contribute to improved health outcomes, wellbeing and community development initiatives. These projects also support economic development by making places more attractive and interesting, which attracts inward investment and cultural tourism for the benefit of both the cultural sector and the broader business sector. The Globe Theatre, Bankside The Tate Modern Gallery, Bankside 175 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P47 Community uses 1. Development must: 1. Retain community facilities; or 2. In exceptional circumstances, community facilities can be replaced by another use where they are surplus to requirements. This needs to be demonstrated by a marketing exercise for two years immediately prior to any planning application, for both its existing condition and as an opportunity for an improved community facility at market rates. 2. An Equalities Impact Assessment will be required for any proposed loss of community facilities in predominant use by protected characteristic communities as defined by the Equality Act 2010. 3. Development will be permitted where: 1. New community facilities are provided that are accessible for all members of the community. Reasons Community facilities encompass a wide range of uses essential to meet diverse local needs. We will ensure that everyone has access to a variety of good quality community facilities that promote healthier lifestyles and enable people to meet their needs for health, leisure, training, youth, voluntary and general community provision. Community facilities should be designed and operated to facilitate access by people from all backgrounds to ensure that their needs are met. 176 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Christchurch, Peckham Leisure, Arts, Culture and Community Uses Leisure, Arts, Culture and Community Uses are important components of social infrastructure. Social infrastructure covers a range of services and facilities that meet local needs and contribute towards a good quality of life. It includes health provision, education, community, play, youth, early years, recreation, sports, faith, criminal justice and emergency facilities. Changes to the Use Classes Order 1987 from 1 September 2020, have meant these uses, previously D1 and D2, fall across class E, F.1, F.2 and Sui Generis, as below (although non-exhaustive). Class E Commercial, business and service E(d) for indoor sport, recreation or fitness, not involving motorised vehicles or firearms, principally to visiting members of the public; E(e) for the provision of medical or health services, principally to visiting members of the public, except the use of premises attached to the residence of the consultant or practitioner; E(f) for a crèche, day nursery or day centre, not including a residential use, principally to visiting members of the public. (f) for, or in connection with, public worship or religious instruction, (g)as a law court. 177 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Class F1 Learning and non-residential institutions (a)for the provision of education, (b)for the display of works of art (otherwise than for sale or hire), (c)as a museum, (d) as a public library or public reading room, (e) as a public hall or exhibition hall, Class F2 Local community F2(b) Halls or meeting places for the principal use of the local community F2(c) Areas or places for outdoor sport or recreation (not involving motorised vehicles or firearms) F2(d) Indoor or outdoor swimming pools or skating rinks Sui Generis Uses that do not fall into a specific use class such as: a venue for live music performance a cinema a concert hall a bingo hall a dance hall 178 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P48 Hot food takeaways New hot food takeaways will only be permitted where: 1. The number of hot food takeaway premises are not more than 5% of the total number of units in the protected shopping frontage; and 2. The concentration of hot food takeaway premises would not be above 1 per 21 premises (10 on either side of the proposal); and 3. The proposed location is further than 400 metres from any existing or proposed primary or secondary school’s boundary; and 4. Grease traps are installed to prevent the build-up of food deposits in sewers and drains; and 5. Within the takeaway, the kitchen extraction system is designed to control cooking odours, where the discharge stack is installed in accordance with the following hierarchy: 1. Not less than one metre above the roof ridge of any building within 20 metres of the building where the commercial kitchen is located; 2. Not less than one metre above the roof eaves or dormer window of the building where the commercial kitchen is located, supported by additional odour control measures; 3. An exceptionally high level of odour control measure, where low level discharge should be avoided. Reasons 1. Hot food takeaways can offer a popular service to local communities and provide employment/ business opportunities. However, in the interests of the health of residents, particularly children, as well as ensuring a mix of different uses in shopping frontages, the numbers of hot food takeaways uses need to be carefully controlled. Research in the Old Kent Road area indicates that despite their intentions, the availability of fresh ingredients and generally good cooking knowledge, many people find it easier to buy food from a takeaway. 2. Tackling obesity is one of the key health priorities for Southwark, where children in Reception and Year 6 are recorded as having some of the highest levels of overweight and obesity in the country. Evidence shows that environmental factors influence behaviours in various ways, and this has an impact on the weight status of individuals living, working or learning in a particular area. High numbers of school children have been recorded visiting takeaways after school in Southwark and both school children and adults have complained in focus groups that there are too many takeaways near schools. It is for this reason that an exclusionary zone is set at a radius of 400 metres from the boundary of both primary and secondary schools (10 minute walk). The emotional and psychological effects of being overweight include discrimination and teasing by peers; low self-esteem, anxiety and depression, potentially impacting educational performance and wellbeing. Obese children may also suffer disturbed sleep and fatigue, impacting on quality of life. 179 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Figure 7: Hot food takeaway secondary school exclusion zones 180 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P49 Public transport Development must: 1. Demonstrate that the public transport network has sufficient capacity to support any increase in the number of journeys by the users of the development, taking into account the cumulative impact of local existing and permitted development; and 2. Improve accessibility to public transport by creating and improving walking and cycling connections to public transport stops or stations; and 3. Improve, maintain and enhance public transport services. Reasons Southwark has excellent public transport provision, but we need to ensure that new development supports our public transport networks so that people can move around quickly and safely. The scale of development should be proportionate to the level of public transport accessibility and the capacity of the transport network to absorb new journeys that may result from the development. Improved quality and integration of public transport services will result in more pleasant journeys for passengers and encourage more people to use public transport. By encouraging more people to use public transport, emissions from private vehicles will be reduced. P50 Highways impacts Development must: 1. Minimise the demand for private car journeys; and 2. Demonstrate that the road network has sufficient capacity to support any increase in the number of the journeys by the users of the development, taking into account the cumulative impact of adjoining or nearby development; and 3. Ensure safe and efficient operation of the local road network, the bus network and the Transport for London Road Network; and 4. Ensure safe and efficient delivery and servicing that minimises the number of motor vehicle journeys; and 5. Incorporate delivery and servicing within major development sites and not on the public highway; and 6. Demonstrate how the construction phase of the development that needs to use the public highway can be safely accomplished, and how vehicular movements will be minimised and strictly controlled to reduce danger to vulnerable road users. Reasons We must ensure that the road network within Southwark is safe and efficient and that there are no negative impacts from new development. Locating the functions of the building including servicing, cycle parking and plant within the development will enable day to day activity to take place without having significant impacts on the surroundings. Reducing carbon emissions by minimising the need for private car journeys. 181 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P51 Walking Development must: 1. Enhance the borough’s walking networks by providing footways, routes and public realm that enable access through development sites and adjoining areas; and 2. Ensure routes and access are safe and designed to be inclusive and meet the needs of all pedestrians, with particular emphasis on disabled people and the mobility impaired. Street furniture must be located to allow the movement of pushchairs, wheelchairs and mobility scooters; and 3. Ensure that disruption of walking routes during construction is minimised and any diversions are convenient and clearly signposted; and 4. Enhance strategic networks such as the Green Chain walking route, the Low Line and support new and existing green links across the borough and sub-regionally. Reasons This policy will ensure the delivery of Southwark’s walking strategy so that Southwark will be fully accessible and streets and spaces will be welcoming, attractive and convenient for those on foot, leading to more people walking. Research in the Old Kent Road Action Area has shown that, despite the popularity of walking, a lot more people could be walking more to improve their health. Bringing more destinations closer to residents, limiting the impacts of construction as well as improving pavements, crossings and public spaces can encourage people to walk more. Measures to encourage walking can also help tackle social isolation and routes should accommodate parents and older or disabled people. Walking is an important way to reduce emissions from motorised transport. Low Line Routes encourage walking over the use of private vehicles which reduce emissions and mitigate against climate change. P52 Low Line routes 1. Development must: 1. Support the implementation of ‘Low Line’ routes; and 2. Not hinder or obstruct the implementation of ‘Low Line’ routes. 2. Low Line routes should utilise one or both sides of the railway arches, as well as new routes through arches. Reasons 1. Southwark’s ‘Low Line’ walking routes link existing centres of activity and enterprise by creating new attractive routes alongside rail arches and viaducts and their associated spaces and streets to improve accessibility and the quality of experience for walking. The Low Line routes will facilitate economic growth and improve access and permeability along the rail viaducts. 2. The Low Line routes are in the following locations and set out in Figure 8: 1. Waterloo to Maltby Street to Rotherhithe New Road 182 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 2. Camberwell to River Thames 3. Rye Lane to Old Kent Road, including the Peckham Coal Line. 183 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Low Line routes marker 184 Southwark Plan 2022 Railway Arches, Bermondsey Trading Estate Table of Contents P53 Cycling Development must: 1. Ensure the delivery of the Southwark Spine cycle route (Figure 9) and our wider cycling route network. All sites on or adjacent to the network must support and integrate into the network; and 2. Provide cycle parking for building users and visitors in accordance with Tables 9 and 10; and 3. Provide cycle parking that is secure, weatherproof, conveniently located, well lit and accessible; and 4. Provide cycle parking that includes an adequate element of parking suitable for accessible bicycles and tricycles; and 5. For commercial uses, provide associated showers and changing facilities that are proportionate to the number of cycle parking spaces provided; and 6. Contribute toward the provision of cycle hire schemes and docking stations. Financial contributions will be required from major developments that are commensurate to the size and scale of the proposal. This may also include providing space within the development for the expansion of the cycle hire scheme; and 7. Provide a free two year cycle hire fob per dwelling where a docking station is located within 400m of the proposed development. Reasons This should significantly increase the number of people who cycle and the number of trips made by bicycle, and ensure our streets will support easy and safe cycling. Cycling is an alternative mode to reduce emissions from motorised transport.

Adhere to the residential car parking standards in Table 11; and 2. Provide all car parking spaces within the development site and not on the public highway; and 3. Provide electric vehicle charging points (EVCP) where on site parking is permitted; and 4. Provide a minimum of three years free membership, per eligible adult who is the primary occupier of the development, to a car club if a car club bay is located within 850m of the development; and / or contribute towards the provision of new car club bays proportionate to the size and scale of the development if it creates 80 units or more; and 5. Ensure that retail or leisure car parking within town centres is shared with public parking and is not reserved for customers of a particular development; and 6. Ensure off-street town centre car parking follows the requirements as set out in Table 12, which: 1. Is appropriately located and sized to support the vitality of the town centre and ensures the use of the site is optimised; and 2. Supports the rapid turnover of spaces; and 3. Includes maximum stay restrictions; and 4. Provides alternative access to the use of a car by providing the required amount of car club bays parking spaces within the site. 2. Development within existing or planned Controlled Parking Zones (CPZs) will not be eligible for on street resident and business car-parking permits; and 3. Where off-street car parking spaces are proposed/permitted, the number of spaces provided should be determined by considering: 1. The anticipated demand for the parking spaces and tenure of the development; and 2. The quality and accessibility of the local public transport network and the access to local amenities. Reasons Private cars take up much more resources and space per person than many other modes of transport, particularly walking, cycling and public transport. Southwark will grow sustainably without adverse environmental impacts and carbon emissions through car free development in highly accessible areas and reduced reliance on the private car. 188 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents |Table 11: Residential car parking standards|Col2| ||| |Zone of accessibility to public transport|Residential car parking provision (maximum)| |PTAL 6a, 6b and 5 and 4 areas|Zero maximum spaces per home.

Development must: 1. Provide accessible car parking spaces up to a maximum of one car parking space per wheelchair accessible unit. The number of spaces provided may be determined by considering: 1. The anticipated demand for the parking space and tenure of the development; and 2. The quality and accessibility of the local public transport network and the access to local amenities. 2. Ensure that car parking spaces that are provided for disabled people and the physically impaired: 1. Are located within the development and in close proximity to the nearest entrance or lift core; and 2. Allow sufficient space to access the vehicle from both sides and at the rear of the vehicle; and 3. Have entrance ramps that are the correct gradient to accommodate higher vehicles when parking is underground; and 4. Enable easy manoeuvrability into and out of the space provided; and 5. Remain designated for people with disabilities or mobility impairments in perpetuity. Any spaces that remain unused must not be returned to the general car parking pool. Reasons This policy will ensure that the mobility needs of disabled and mobility impaired people are provided consistently, conveniently and to a high standard. Requirements for additional accessible car parking spaces will correspond with the location of the development, demand and use of the development and the accessibility of the local public transport network and local amenities. 190 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Climate Emergency P56 Protection of amenity 1. Development should not be permitted when it causes an unacceptable loss of amenity to present or future occupiers or users. Amenity considerations that will be taken into account include: 1. The privacy and outlook of occupiers of both existing and proposed homes 2. Actual or sense of overlooking or enclosure 3. Impacts of smell, noise, vibration, lighting or other nuisances 4. Daylight, sunlight, and impacts from wind and on microclimate 5. Residential layout, context and design Reasons The amenity of those living, working in or visiting Southwark needs to be protected, to ensure a pleasant environment. Factors that impact on amenity can be visual, audible and odorous. P57 Open Space 1. Development will not be permitted on Metropolitan Open Land (MOL) or Borough Open Land (BOL). In exceptional circumstances development may be permitted on MOL or BOL when: 1. It consists of ancillary facilities that positively contribute to the setting, accessibility and quality of the open space and if it does not affect its openness or detract from its character. Ancillary facilities on MOL must be essential for outdoor sport or recreation, cemeteries or for other uses of land which preserve the openness of MOL and do not conflict with its MOL function; or 2. It consists of the extension or alteration of an existing building providing that it does not result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original building; or 3. It consists of the replacement of an existing building, provided that the new building is no larger than the building it replaces. 2. Development will not be permitted on Other Open Space (OOS). In exceptional circumstances development may be permitted if it consists of replacement OOS of equivalent or greater size or substantially better quality can be secured on site or nearby before development commences. Reasons 1. Open spaces in Southwark cover over 21% of its land area, including woodlands, parks, community farms, cemeteries, Thames-side paths and sports pitches. Open spaces are an essential resource for residents and visitors, used for sports and other exercise, relaxation, socialisation, nature conservation, food growing and cultural events. We will maintain and improve open spaces as set out in the Open Space Strategy to ensure 191 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents that residents and visitors experience the health and wellbeing benefits associated with these activities. Open spaces are afforded protection according to their importance as defined within their MOL, BOL and OOS designations. Regeneration provides the opportunity to provide improved open space by developing ancillary facilities or, on OOS, replacing existing open spaces with greater or better quality space. 2. We have designated 4 new BOL sites and 18 new OOS sites as part of the Southwark Plan 2022, creating an additional 49,435sqm of designated open space within Southwark. Additionally, 8 BOL sites, 1 OOS site and 5 MOL sites have been extended, which totals an additional 50,425sqm. A major new park for Elephant and Castle, Elephant Park (0.8ha) is currently under construction. 3. New open space is planned for in strategic site allocations across the borough totalling approximately 11 hectares. This includes a 1.37ha park at Canada Water and a number of new parks in the Old Kent Road Opportunity Area. When the new open spaces are completed and open to the public, these will be designated as new formal open spaces in accordance with the open space designations criteria outlined in the fact box. 4. Protecting and improving open space plays an important role in climate change adaption and mitigation. 192 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Fact box: Open Space Designations Metropolitan Open Land (MOL): Strategic open land within the urban area that contributes to the structure of London. It carries the same general presumption against development as Green Belt. Land designated as Metropolitan Open Land should satisfy one or more of the following criteria: 1. Land that contributes to the physical structure of London by being clearly distinguishable from the built up area; 2. Land that includes open air facilities, especially for leisure, recreation, sport, arts, cultural activities and tourism which serve the whole or significant parts of London; 3. Land that contains features or landscapes of historic, recreational, nature conservation or habitat interest at a metropolitan or national level; 4. Land that forms part of a green chain and meets one of the above criteria or based on the council’s discretion informed by an evidence base study. The following types of open space must be MOL: 1. Metropolitan sites of nature conservation; 2. Sites that are on the register of parks and gardens of special historic interest in England; 3. Metropolitan parks; 4. District parks. Acceptable uses for MOL are: 1. Public and private open spaces, playing fields and outdoor sport, including outdoor recreational facilities for which adequate provision cannot be made within the urban area; 2. Existing institutions standing in extensive grounds; 3. Woodlands and orchards; 4. Rivers, reservoirs, lakes, docks and other open water; 5. Allotments and nursery gardens; 6. Cemeteries and associated crematoria; 7. Nature conservation. Borough Open Land (BOL): Open space of local importance. BOL must meet all of the following criteria: 1. An area of local importance to Southwark; 2. A clearly distinguishable open space; 3. Land that contains features or landscapes of historic, recreational or nature conservation value at a borough level; 4. It must not be MOL. 193 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents The following types of open space must be BOL: 1. Borough sites of nature conservation; 2. Local parks and open spaces over 2 hectares that have public access; 3. Open spaces over 0.4 hectares that occur in areas of local open space deficiency; 4. Open spaces over 0.4 hectares that occur in areas of district open space deficiency; 5. Open spaces protected under the London Squares Preservation Act; 6. Local historic sites of interest. Other Open Space (OOS): Open Spaces that are not MOL or BOL, but meet one or more of the following criteria: 1. Allotments; 2. Public open space including public parks and gardens; 3. Playing fields and sports grounds whether publicly or privately owned; 4. Private open space which is of benefit to the local community; 5. Open space that has been created and secured through planning obligations; 6. Sites of ecological importance. Other open space does not include open spaces that are ancillary to, and/or within the curtilage of a building. Burgess Park 194 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P58 Open water space 1. Development within designated Open Water Space will only be permitted when it consists of ancillary facilities that positively contribute to the setting, accessibility and quality of the open space and they do not affect its openness or detract from its character. This includes berths, residential, commercial and visitor mooring. 2. Development that affects designated open water spaces must ensure that all safety and navigational impacts are minimised. Reasons 1. Southwark has several unique open water spaces on the Rotherhithe peninsula owing to the dockland heritage of the area. We will need to maintain and improve these spaces, to provide benefits associated with health and wellbeing, recreation, quality of life and cohesive communities. There is a high demand for berths and moorings that is not being met in Southwark and across London. Where water space is underused at present, new berths and moorings could increase the enjoyment of the River Thames. 2. We are currently undertaking an assessment on the need for houseboat accommodation in Southwark. The findings of this assessment, or any other future London wide assessment, will be used to inform the relevant policies in the Plan. Any necessary changes to the Plan will be considered in an early partial review which will be set out in the Local Development Scheme. 195 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P59 Green infrastructure 1. Major development must: 1. Provide green infrastructure with arrangements in place for long term stewardship and maintenance funding. 2. Major development that is referable to the Mayor of London must: 1. Provide new publically accessible open space and green links. 3. Green infrastructure should be designed to: 1. Provide multiple benefits for the health of people and wildlife; and; 2. Integrate with the wider green infrastructure network and townscape / landscape, increasing access for people and habitat connectivity; and 3. Be adaptable to climate change and allow species migration while supporting native and priority species; and 4. Extend and upgrade the walking and cycling networks between spaces to promote a sense of place and ownership for all. Reasons 1. Green infrastructure is a network of habitats which is often multifunctional and can provide a range of benefits. These include improving mental health, encouraging active lifestyles and recreation, food growing and enhanced biodiversity. The provision of new green infrastructure plays an important role in climate change adaption and mitigation, ecological resilience, flood risk management, temperature regulation and improved air and water quality. 2. Green links will join up residents in existing and new neighbourhoods with open spaces and leisure facilities. They will pass along quieter streets and through open spaces, offering an attractive cleaner air option to walk, cycle or run past urban greenery. They will be designed for people with different mobility needs, creating an environment in which inactivity and isolation can be reduced. An integrated green infrastructure network can allow wildlife to move around with continuous habitat and stepping stones. This can include open land and water, tree avenues and canopies, swales, biodiverse roofs, hedges, grass, brown roofs, green walls and planters. 196 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P60 Biodiversity 1. Development must contribute to net gains in biodiversity through: 1. Enhancing the nature conservation value of Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINCs), Local Nature Reserves (LNRs), designated ancient woodland, populations of protected species and priority habitats/species identified in the United Kingdom, London or identified and monitored in the latest adopted Southwark Nature Action Plan; and 2. Protecting and avoiding damage to SINCs, LNRs, populations of protected species and priority habitats/ species; and 3. Including features such as green and brown roofs, green walls, soft landscaping, nest boxes, habitat restoration and expansion, improved green links and buffering of existing habitats. 2. Any shortfall in net gains in biodiversity must be secured off site through planning obligations or as a financial contribution. Reasons 1. Biodiversity benefits people within and outside Southwark by maintaining ecosystems, providing natural resources, regulating the environment mitigating and adapting to climate change, and enriching mental health and wellbeing as well as having intrinsic value. Regeneration, particularly in areas of natural deficiency, presents the opportunity to deliver net biodiversity gains benefitting local people by introducing features for wildlife as part of green infrastructure. 2. Due to the intense pressure on land for development, it is important that areas and features of nature conservation value or ecological importance are identified and the flora and fauna are protected and enhanced. 197 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P61 Trees 1. Development will be permitted if trees are planted as part of landscaping and public realm schemes, commensurate to the scale and type of development, and the character of the neighbourhood. 2. Development must retain and protect significant existing trees including: 1. Trees designated with Tree Protection Orders (TPOs); and 2. Trees that have a high amenity value; and 3. Trees within Conservation Areas or the setting or curtilage of listed buildings; and 4. Veteran, ancient and notable trees; and 3. Development must retain and enhance the borough’s trees and canopy cover; and 4. Where trees are removed to facilitate development, they should be replaced by new trees which result in no net loss of amenity, taking into account canopy cover as measured by stem girth; either 1. Within the development whereby valuation may be calculated using the Capital Asset Value for Amenity Trees (CAVAT) methodology or other assessment; or 2. If this is not possible, outside the development. In this case a financial contribution must be provided to improve borough tree planting located according to ‘right tree right place’ principles. The financial contribution will include ongoing maintenance costs where trees are planted in the public realm. 5. Tree planting should be adaptable to climate change while supporting native species. The selection and position of trees should improve air quality and they should have a long life with and high biodiversity and amenity value. 6. Retained trees must be protected during the construction process in line with British Standard BS5837. 7. In exceptional circumstances removal of trees protected by TPO or conservation area status will be permitted where sufficient evidence has been provided to justify their loss. Replacement planting will be expected where removal is agreed. The replacement of TPO trees must take into account the loss of canopy cover as measured by stem girth and biodiversity value. Reasons Southwark’s 108,000 trees are an asset to the borough as they provide many amenity, environmental and financial benefits that include landscaping, providing habitats for biodiversity, providing shading and reducing the urban heat island effect. Trees also have an important role in enhancing air quality, carbon storage (especially mature trees) and climate change mitigation reducing surface water flood risk, helping people find their way around and are important historical features. 198 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents The ‘Right Tree Right Place principles ensure that size and species of trees are considered alongside the constraints of the planting site to ensure they are planted to ensure long-term benefits for our residents and visitors. We will ensure that planting takes place as close as possible to the application site where feasible’ and is informed by our borough studies and the Tree Strategy. P62 Reducing waste 1. Development must: 1. Demonstrate how the following waste management hierarchy will be applied during construction: 1. Avoid creating waste; then 2. Reduce the amount of waste produced; then 3. Prepare waste materials for re-use; then 4. Recycle and compost waste materials; then 5. Recover energy from waste materials; then 6. Dispose waste materials in landfill; and 2. Provide adequate recycling, composting and waste disposal, collection and storage facilities on site; or 3. Provide a suitable off site waste management strategy that does not adversely impact amenity, access or the environment where on site waste management provision is not possible. 4. Major referable development should submit a Circular Economy Statement. Reasons Waste can have negative impacts on health and wellbeing, amenity and the environment. Southwark achieves high levels of re-use and recycling but waste management infrastructure will be under continual pressure from intense levels of development. Providing waste facilities and ensuring appropriate waste management arrangements are in place for both completed development and development undergoing construction will ensure that these impacts are reduced as much as possible. The reduction and proper management of waste to reduce carbon emissions is crucial for mitigating against climate change. Fact box: Circular Economy Principles and Circular Economy Statements Circular Economy Principles are: 1. Conserve resources, increase efficiency and source sustainably 2. Design to eliminate waste (and for ease of maintenance) 3. Manage waste sustainably and at the highest value Circular Economy Statements are an assessment of how a development will incorporate Circular Economy measures into all aspects of the design, construction and operation process. 199 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P63 Land for waste managment 1. The Integrated Waste Management Facility (IWMF) will be protected for waste management purposes unless: 1. The site is surplus to requirements; or 2. Another facility is provided that meets the same throughput as the existing site. 2. New and extended waste management facilities should be permitted where: 1. They are in a suitable location which does not cause unacceptable harm to residential amenity, the environment or transport network; and 2. They are planned and designed according to the following principles of sustainable waste management: 1. The waste management hierarchy as prescribed in P62 (1); and 2. The proximity principle of managing waste as close to the source as is practicable; and 3. The ‘circular economy’ principles to provide social, economic and environmental benefits; and 4. Facilities are sited in close proximity to potential heat consumers where any facilities will provide low carbon energy recovery which produces heat. Reasons 1. Transporting and dumping waste into landfill causes harm to the environment and is a very inefficient use of both resources and land. Reducing the amount of waste that goes to landfill and improving on the efficient use of resources, will help to reduce the impacts of man-made climate change. Ways we can reduce waste are to have sufficient waste management facilities in the borough that prioritise re-use, recycling and energy recovery from any waste materials. The principles of the “circular economy” seek to maximise the reuse of waste materials while providing environmental and economic benefits, such as creating jobs and apprenticeships. 2. In the London Plan 2021, the Mayor of London set out that Southwark needs to have waste management facilities that are capable of processing 159,000 tonnes of waste by 2041. The ‘Proximity Principle’ enables testing to ensure that sites are retained and developed to process waste as close to the source as possible. The principles of sustainable waste management ensure that waste is managed to minimise creating waste by avoiding waste, reusing, recycling and recovering energy from waste. 3. We have designated the Integrated Waste Management Facility (IWMF), near the Old Kent Road, as a safeguarded waste site. The IWMF’s waste processing capacity helps towards meeting our waste 200 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents apportionment targets set out in the London Plan. The IWMF is able to process a maximum of 205,176 tonnes per annum (tpa), of which 111,150 tpa counts towards meeting our apportionment target. The methodology for how this figure has been derived is set out in the Joint South East London Waste Group Technical Paper evidence base document. P64 Contaminated land and hazardous substances 1. Development that has an adverse impact on the environment will not be permitted. 2. Development will be permitted when it: 1. Provides for safe storage, transportation or usage of hazardous substances on a site; and 2. Mitigates any contaminated land within the development site and land outside of, but related to, the development site. Reasons The regeneration of vacant or under-used land and buildings in Southwark requires development to deal with contamination from past uses and carry out construction in close proximity to neighbours. We need to minimise adverse effects on the natural environment such as soil, water, habitat and biodiversity. There should be no risk to the health, safety or amenity of users of the site and neighbouring occupiers. The effects of new development on the environment can be temporary, permanent and/ or cumulative and if these impacts are not identified at the design stage it can be much more difficult to add measures once a scheme is built. The temporary impacts of the construction process can be detrimental to the surrounding community so it is important that any such impacts arising from development are identified and reduced. 201 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents P65 Improving air quality 1. Development must: 1. Achieve or exceed air quality neutral standards; and 2. Address the impacts of poor air quality on building occupiers and public realm users by reducing exposure to and mitigating the effects of poor air quality. This must be achieved through design solutions that include: 1. Orientation and layout of buildings, taking into account vulnerable building occupiers, and public realm and amenity space users; and 2. Ventilation systems; and 3. Urban greening appropriate for providing air quality benefits proportionate to the scale of the development; and 2. Any shortfall in air quality standards on site must be secured off site through planning obligations or as a financial contribution. Reasons 1. Southwark has poor air quality across many parts of the borough. Poor air quality includes high concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and nitrogen oxides (N0x). These pollutants have a direct and adverse impact on the health, quality of life and life expectancy of Londoners and on the environment and exacerbate climate change. 2. Developments that are Air Quality Neutral will help to minimise air pollution. Air Quality Neutral standards are a set of maximum emissions benchmarks for two categories of pollution. The first is buildings of different land uses, while the second is for transport emissions generated by the development. 3. Air quality can also be impacted by construction, particularly major developments where construction processes occur over a longer period of time. Temporary monitoring of impacts of construction on air quality should work to reduce the impact of dust and emissions during construction and demolition. 4. Some plant species are much more effective at reducing pollutants than others. Some species can make poor air quality much worse. Therefore consideration of the species and arrangement of any urban greening is critical to improving air quality. 5. Off setting measures, where required, include: 1. Green planting/walls and screens, with special consideration given to planting that absorbs or suppresses pollutants; and 202 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 2. Upgrade or abatement work to combustion plant; and 3. Retrofitting abatement technology for vehicles and flues; and 4. Exposure reduction. P66 Reducing noise pollution and enhancing soundscapes 1. Development must: 1. Avoid significant adverse impacts on health and quality of life; and 2. Mitigate any adverse impacts caused by noise on health and quality of life; and 3. Mitigate and manage noise by separating noise sensitive developments from major noise sources by distance, screening or internal layout, in preference to sound insulation. 2. Major development adjacent to, or within: 1. Designated open space; and 2. Designated open water space; and 3. Hard landscaped civic spaces with public amenity value; and 4. Street markets, should be designed to protect and enhance positive aspects of the acoustic environment. New spaces proposed as part of development should also assess the potential to enhance a place’s character and identity through the acoustic environment and positive public soundscape. 3. Major development will be required to demonstrate how the noise pollution impacts created during the construction process will be reduced, mitigated and managed appropriately to minimise harm to present occupiers of the site and adjoining neighbours. Reasons 1. Much of Southwark is a dense urban environment with high levels of activity that can generate noise. Noise can have a major detrimental impact on the quality of life for a user of a building or space. Effects can include stress, annoyance and sleep disturbance. It is important that noise management is considered as early as possible in the planning process and as an integral part of development proposals. Reducing noise pollution will minimise instances of such effects from unwanted noise and reduce risk of overheating. This can be achieved through an improved acoustic environment, incorporating appropriate soundscapes and ensuring development reflects good acoustic design principles, including traditional and innovative noise reduction measures. This can include separating noise sensitive developments from major noise sources; distance; screening or internal layout, in preference to use of sound insulation. 203 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 2. Some places and spaces in Southwark are highly valued for their amenity use and/or character. Noise and sound have an important role to play in both contributing, and sometimes detracting, from this character. Development can be designed to strengthen public soundscapes that contribute to the character of the place or space and enhance its identity. It can also be important in improving amenity value for users of a space. P67 Reducing water use Development should reduce water use by: 1. Ensuring that residential development has a ‘safe to drink’ water use of no more than 105 litres per person per day, excluding an allowance of 5 litres or less per person per day for external water use; and 2. Incorporating measures to reduce the demand for mains water treated to drinking standard and enable the use of grey water and/or rainwater for non-drinking uses; and 3. Major development should assess the need for improvements to water supply infrastructure in discussion with water utility companies. Reasons London is facing a worsening water shortage. This is caused by climate change and increased demand from an increased population. Currently, all mains water is treated to a drinking standard. This is an expensive and energy intensive process. This is particularly considering that at least 50% of water consumed in homes and workplaces does not need to be of drinkable quality. London’s consumption of water already outstrips available supplies in dry years. This means Southwark needs to play its role in reducing the level of water consumption per person. The need for this will be exacerbated by climate change impacts. These impacts are predicted to include more sporadic and intense rainfall and a higher likelihood of droughts. Limiting the type of fittings that water dispensing and consuming elements of a development can incorporate will contribute to ensuring the most efficient use of London’s limited water resources. The reduction of water usage is crucial for adaptation to climate change. P68 Reducing flood risk 1. Development must not increase flood risk on or off site, by ensuring that: 1. It is designed to be safe and resilient to flooding; and 2. Finished floor levels are set no lower than 300mm above the predicted maximum water level where they are located within an area at risk of flooding; and 3. Major development reduces surface water run-off to greenfield run-off rates. This must be through the application of water sensitive urban design and Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS), in 204 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents accordance with the following drainage hierarchy: 1. Store rainwater for later use; then 2. Use infiltration techniques; then 3. Attenuate rainwater in ponds or open water features for gradual release; then 4. Discharge rainwater direct to a watercourse; then 5. Discharge rainwater to a surface water sewer/drain; then 6. Discharge rainwater to the combined sewer; and 7. Hard surfacing of any gardens is permeable. 2. Development located on sites on or adjacent to the River Thames frontage should be set back from the River defence wall by 10m. This space should be designed and delivered for dual purposes by incorporating the required flood defence measures and providing an enhanced public amenity and environmental benefit. Reasons 1. Much of Southwark is at risk of flooding. This risk comes from two main sources. First is the tidal and river flooding from the River Thames. We are currently protected from this risk by the Thames Barrier. However, we still need to plan effectively to minimise risk should the barrier ever fail as a flood defence. Areas at risk of flooding from the Thames include the neighbourhoods in the north of the borough. Reducing flood risk is also essential for adapting to the potential impacts of climate change. 2. The Environment Agency’s Thames Estuary Plan (2011) sets out the measures that will be required to be implemented to maintain adequate flood risk protection from the River Thames by the year 2100, taking into account the impacts of climate change, increased rainfall and rising sea levels. The plan advises that by 2065, the existing flood defences of the river wall running from Bankside to Rotherhithe will need to be raised by 0.5m and a further 0.5m by 2100. This will block the eye level views from the current Thames Path. By setting development back from the river frontage there are significant opportunities to enhance the Thames Path when new development comes forward. By requiring flood defences and flood risk minimisation strategies on these sites to incorporate measures which improve the amenity and biodiversity value of the Thames Path we can will offset the negative amenity impacts of raising the river wall. 3. The second risk of flooding is from the surface water flooding in our Critical Drainage Areas. These are areas where, when there is heavy rainfall, local flooding occurs. Water can rapidly pool in these drainage areas, where too many hard surfaces contribute to too much surface run-off. It is also caused by local topography where hills and valleys form catchment basins for water. Surface water flooding events within Southwark, most notably in 1984, 2004 and 2007 have shown the risk and impact of flooding on residential communities and public infrastructure. The rate of surface run-off (and so the related flood risk) can be significantly reduced through the careful design of developments and the inclusion of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS). 4. The hard surfacing of front gardens increases water run-off when it rains, increasing flood risk, and also reduces habitat for wildlife. Planning permission is not currently required to pave over a front garden of a 205 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents house as long as the surface is permeable. However planning permission is required where the proposal involves putting a non-permeable driveway surface over an area of more than five sqm. For these reasons we require applicants to use permeable surfaces when surfacing their gardens. P69 Sustainability standards 1. Development must: 1. Achieve a BREEAM rating of ‘Excellent’ for non-residential development and non self-contained residential development over 500sqm; and 2. Achieve BREEAM rating of ‘Excellent’ in domestic refurbishment for conversion, extension and change of use of residential floorspace over 500sqm; and 3. Achieve BREEAM rating of ‘Excellent’ in non-domestic refurbishment for conversion, extension and change of use of non-residential floorspace over 500sqm; and 4. Reduce the risk of overheating, taking into account climate change predictions over the life time of the building, in accordance with prioritised measures set out in the following cooling hierarchy: 1. Reduce the amount of heat entering a building through the orientation, shading, albedo, fenestration, insulation and green roofs and walls; then 2. Minimise internal heat generation through energy efficient design; then 3. Manage the heat within the building through exposed internal thermal mass and high ceilings; then 4. Passive ventilation; then 5. Mechanical ventilation; then 6. Active cooling systems (ensuring they are the lowest carbon options). Reasons 1. Climate change has the potential to have catastrophic impacts on the environment and life on Earth. Evidence suggests that human activities have contributed, and will continue to contribute to climate change. Such human activities include using limited natural resources and releasing waste and pollution. Southwark is anticipated to experience hotter summers and wetter winters due to climate change. These will have serious consequences for the borough’s residential, working and visitor population if the extent of climate change is not reduced and these impacts of climate change are not effectively mitigated to address climate change and contribute to meeting net carbon zero by 2050. 2. We can reduce the impacts of climate change by changing the way we design and construct our built environment. The built environment contributes to a large proportion of resource use and waste and pollution emissions. This policy requires high environmental standards to reduce the extent of man-made climate change, specifically how we design and construct our built environment. 206 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents 3. Development that is designed with high environmental standards for the long term will benefit Southwark residents by addressing environmental impacts now and will reduce the disruption and expense of retrofitting the built environment in the future. The Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM) ratings are the industry standard for sustainable design and construction. BREEAM rated developments are more sustainable environments that enhance the well-being of the people who live and work in them, help protect natural resources and make for more attractive property investment. 4. Some developments may be prone to internal over-heating which results in a poor standard of accommodation. Overheated buildings also require more resources to cool, which does not help to reduce the extent of climate change. Factors that typically increase the risk of internal over-heating include those exposed to high solar gain (e.g. highly glazed south-facing facades) and/or those with a lack of ventilation. P70 Energy All development All development Energy Hierarchy Energy Hierarchy 1. Development must minimise carbon emissions on site in accordance with the following energy hierarchy: 1. Be lean (energy efficient design and construction); then 2. Be clean (low carbon energy supply); then 3. Be green (on site renewable energy generation and storage). Major development Major development 2. Development must reduce operational greenhouse gas emissions and minimise both annual and peak energy demand. This must be in accordance with the following energy hierarchy: 1. Be lean (energy efficient design and construction); then 2. Be clean (low carbon energy supply); then 3. Be green (on site renewable energy generation and storage); then 4. Be seen (monitor, verify and report on energy performance); then 5. Offset residual carbon emissions to reach zero carbon target. 3. Major development must be net zero-carbon. 4. Major residential development must reduce carbon emissions on site (100% on 2013 Building Regulations). 207 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents In exceptional circumstances, any shortfall must be secured off site through planning obligations or as a financial contribution. 5. Major non-residential development must reduce carbon emissions on site by a minimum of 40% on 2013 Buildings Regulations*. Any shortfall must be secured off site through planning obligations or as a financial contribution. 6. Development proposals referable to the Mayor must calculate whole life cycle carbon emissions through a nationally recognised assessment and demonstrate actions taken to reduce life cycle carbon emissions. Decentralised energy Decentralised energy 7. Major development must be designed to incorporate decentralised energy in accordance with the following hierarchy: 1. Connect to an existing or planned decentralised energy network; then 2. Be future-proofed to connect to a planned decentralised energy network; or 3. Implement a site-wide low carbon communal heating system; and 4. Explore and evaluate the potential to oversize the communal heating system for connection and supply to adjacent sites and, where feasible be implemented. *Building Regulations 2013. If these are updated, the policy threshold will be reviewed. Reasons 1. Southwark is committed to addressing the Climate Emergency by on site carbon reduction. Using energy for the heating, cooling and powering of buildings often uses limited resources and releases waste and polluting emissions. This contributes to man-made climate change. We need to reduce the extent of climate change by changing how we design and construct our built environment. This will help mitigate the impacts of climate change on Southwark’s population and environment. 2. The energy hierarchy sets a framework for how development should approach carbon emission reductions. Savings should be maximised at the first “be lean” stage using energy efficient design and construction. This could include building fabric and materials, orientation and aspect, and the use of passive cooling and heating. Once savings at this stage have been maximised, development should seek further savings through the second “be clean” stage. This stage relates to low carbon energy supply, including decentralised energy networks. Once savings at this stage have been maximised, the use of on site renewable energy generation (“be green”) should be incorporated. 3. The policy requires buildings to be designed and constructed to reduce carbon emissions. Carbon dioxide is a “greenhouse” gas, emissions of which are a waste pollutant which contributes to climate change. In Southwark, 84% of carbon dioxide emissions come from the heating, cooling and powering of buildings. 208 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Decentralised energy networks provide a vital opportunity for reducing carbon emissions. They also provide an opportunity to introduce the use of a cleaner energy supply. It has the potential to reduce fuel poverty in Southwark. The policy requires the expansion of existing decentralised energy networks and, where this is not practicable, the development of new networks to maximise the benefits of decentralised energy supply and storage. 4. Sites have been identified in the Old Kent Road Opportunity Area for possible connection to a District Heat Network providing heat and hot water from the SELCHP combined heat and power plant. This includes the proposed connection to housing estates in the Old Kent Road Opportunity Area. Fact box: Whole Life Cycle Carbon Assesments Whole Lifecycle Carbon approach as set out in the London Plan is needed to capture its unregulated emissions (i.e. those associated with cooking and small appliances), its embodied emissions (i.e. those associated with raw material extraction, manufacture and transport of building materials and construction) and emissions associated with maintenance, repair and replacement as well as dismantling, demolition and eventual material disposal). Whole life-cycle carbon emission assessments are an assessment of unregulated and embodied emissions and emissions associated with redevelopment. These are monitored at the preapplication, submission and post-construction construction stages to close the implementation gap to work towards achieving net carbon zero for new development 209 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Implementation Policies Implementation policies set out how the council will implement the Southwark Plan 2022 as the council’s primary planning and regeneration strategy, alongside the policies in our wider Development Plan, including our Area Action Plans, the London Plan and any neighbourhood plans. IP1 Infrastructure We will work with a range of infrastructure providers, neighbouring boroughs and utility companies to ensure that adequate infrastructure is in place to support future and existing residents. We will also encourage shared servicing options to ensure infrastructure (both social and physical) is in place to support the occupants of developments throughout their lifetimes. Reasons The Southwark Plan 2022 and our Area Action Plans set out the council’s role in trying to accommodate growth from regeneration to ensure that there are enough homes, jobs, school places and health facilities for existing and new residents and workers. In addition to delivering new homes, jobs and facilities, it is essential that there is adequate water, waste, energy and transport infrastructure to facilitate and support the anticipated growth and address climate change, adaptation and mitigation. IP2 Transport infrastructure 1. We will work in partnership with key bodies that include TfL, the GLA and neighbouring boroughs to secure funding and ensure that transport infrastructure supports the needs of residents by prioritising active travel. 2. Development must support the implementation of the following strategic transport projects and initiatives: - The Bakerloo Line extension, including stations on Old Kent Road and where necessary make financial and/or land contribution; - Healthy High Streets projects; - A rail station at Camberwell; - A walking and cycling bridge from Rotherhithe to Canary Wharf; - The Elephant and Castle public realm improvements and the Northern Line ticket hall; - Peckham Rye station; - Expansion of cycle hire. 210 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Reasons 1. Planned increases in public transport capacity and quality as well as improvements to the public realm to improve walking and cycling routes will increase accessibility improving movement and unlocking the potential for further development and mitigating against climate change. 2. This will improve quality of life for people within Southwark and provide infrastructure for the provision of more homes and jobs in Southwark. 3. The Department for Transport has issued safeguarding directions to secure the future of the Bakerloo Line extension. The directions preserve parcels of land for future infrastructure, either temporarily during construction or permanently to ensure the Bakerloo Line extension can be delivered as soon as p o s s i b l e . Land required for the Bakerloo Line extension may be subject to Compulsory Purchase Order if acquisition by agreement is not possible. Formal safeguarding also covers land which, if developed, could otherwise impact on the ability to construct or operate the railway, for example due to foundation design. The directions will require the Planning Authority to consult Transport for London on planning applications within the safeguarding zone. Bakerloo Line train IP3 Community infrastructure levy (CIL) and Section 106 planning obligations Development must: 1. Ensure that any potential adverse impact that makes a proposed development unacceptable is mitigated by using planning conditions in the first instance. Additionally, and where they meet the required tests, Section 106 legal agreements will be used that either a) mitigate the impact or b) pay the council a financial contribution to mitigate the impact. 2. Pay the community infrastructure levy (CIL) which is required to fund the essential infrastructure identified by the council. 3. Submit a viability assessment where the proposed development departs from any planning policy requirements (including land use requirements comprising those set out as ‘must’ or ‘should’ in site allocation 211 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents policies) due to viability. In circumstances where it has been demonstrated that all policy requirements cannot be viably supported by a specific development, priority will be given to the provision of social rented and intermediate housing in housing-led and mixed-use schemes. The weight to be given to a viability assessment will be assessed alongside other material considerations, ensuring that developments remain acceptable in planning terms. Reasons 1. Section 106 legal agreements are used by the council to legally bind a developer into making a development proposal acceptable by either mitigating the impacts of the development or paying the council to mitigate the impacts of the development. Benefits written into the agreements are known as planning obligations. Planning obligations and financial contributions secured by Section 106 agreements must generally be undertaken and spent on projects near the development. Affordable housing is normally secured through Section 106 agreements. 2. Southwark CIL is a financial charge that applicants must pay to the council when they build different types of floorspace in different parts of the borough. For Southwark CIL, this is set out in Southwark’s CIL Charging Schedule (70% of the money collected through Southwark CIL is spent on specific projects across the borough, 25% of CIL is spent near the development and 5% funds the administration of Southwark CIL). Mayoral CIL is collected by the Mayor of London and spent on London-wide infrastructure projects such as Crossrail. The council’s Supplementary Planning Document provides further guidance on CIL and Section 106 planning obligations. Carbon offsetting projects will be funded by the carbon offset fund. 3. The policies in this plan have been subject to a viability assessment which has tested the cumulative impact of relevant standards, obligations and requirements to ensure they do not put implementation of the plan at risk. In accordance with national policy for plan-making this has been undertaken on a broad site typology basis, and shows that in most scenarios development would be viable. Individual sites (and allocation policies) have not been tested for their specific viability. Consequently in instances where applicants do not propose to meet all of the policy requirements (including land use requirements set out under the headings ‘must’ and ‘should’ in site allocation policies) )due to viability, the council will assess the viability of a specific site upon submission of a viability assessment. Priority will be given to the provision of social rented and intermediate due to the acute need for affordable housing delivery in London and Southwark. IP4 Enforcement against unlawful development W e will take enforcement action against unauthorised development where this is expedient. The priorities for enforcement action are set out in the council’s Enforcement Plan. The highest priority is to protect the borough’s housing stock and tackle poor quality accommodation that harms the health and wellbeing of residents. Planning breaches also prioritise loss of amenity and harm to heritage. Reasons We have a responsibility to ensure that development is lawful. Where we have identified that unlawful development may have been undertaken, the council has a responsibility to investigate, recommend and take appropriate action, including enforcement action. 212 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents IP5 Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) We will use our powers to compulsorily purchase land when necessary to meet planning and regeneration objectives set out in the Southwark Plan 2022 and Area Action Plans. Reasons Compulsory Purchase Orders (CPOs) are legal tools available for planning authorities to use to compulsorily purchase land which is owned by a non-co-operating party. Implementing CPOs is a long process that is used as a last resort when all other options, including negotiation, have been exhausted. A successful CPO means the council and its partners are able to meet planning and regeneration objectives which were otherwise hindered by the non-co-operating party. IP6 Monitoring development We will continue to monitor development to assess how our planning policies are working and responding to people’s needs in Southwark. We will require applicants and developers to provide data about their development in a digital format and standard that we need to successfully monitor it. Reasons Annex 4 contains the Southwark Plan 2022 Monitoring Framework which explains how we will collect and publish data and work towards a new digital monitoring system. Monitoring data and results will be published in the Authority Monitoring Report (AMR). The AMR sets out the type and amount of development and conservation taking place in Southwark. It sets out an evaluation of whether planning policies are making a difference and lets us assess how the policies can be improved by future plan maing. We will update the AMR to measure all of the new policies and the strategic Southwark Plan 2022 indicators have been updated to be the same as those for Regeneration For All. These will enable us to measure our progress and success, ensuring we track and evaluate changes that make Southwark successful, such as full employment, health improvements, a more skilled labour market and places that are safe and clean. The AMR is now a website information hub, available online. IP7 Statement of Community Involvement We will consult on planning applications and draft planning policy and guidance documents, in accordance with the Statement of Community Involvement. Reasons We carry out statutory consultation according to regulations and legislation. Our Statement of Community Involvement sets out how we meet and go beyond the requirements set out in the regulations and legislation. 213 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Drop in consultation session by LB Southwark IP8 Local Development Scheme We will prepare and consult on our planning policy and guidance documents in accordance with our latest Local Development Scheme. Reasons The Local Development Scheme (LDS) is a timetable that sets out when the council will be preparing, consulting on and adopting our planning policy and guidance documents over the next three years. 214 Southwark Plan 2022 Table of Contents Site Allocations Site Allocations are planning policies which apply to key potential development sites of strategic importance. Site Allocations are needed to ensure that when a strategic site comes forward for redevelopment it integrates well into its surroundings and contributes towards meeting strategic needs for new homes, jobs, public open space, public access routes, transport infrastructure and social infrastructure, such as health or education facilities. Site Allocations set out the land uses that must be provided as part of any redevelopment alongside other acceptable land uses that may be provided in addition to the required land uses. Site Allocations are not required for sites which are likely to be redeveloped in line with the development management policies of the New Southwark Plan. Must, Should and May Site Allocations require that development ‘must’ achieve certain land uses or requirements where they are essential to meet the strategic needs of the borough. Site Allocations specify that development ‘should’ achieve certain land uses or requirements where they can achieve the ‘must’ requirements of the Site Allocation and can also achieve all the requirements of the ‘should’. All possible efforts should be made to achieve all the site requirements of both ‘must’ and ‘should’. Site Allocations specify that development ‘may’ achieve certain land uses if there is sufficient flexibility after achieving the strategic requirements of the borough as required by the ‘must’ and ‘should’ components of the Site Allocation. We have taken a proactive role in identifying and helping to bring forward land that is suitable for meeting development needs considering the appropriate uplift for each site within the local context. Each site that must provide housing has a minimum capacity to set out the quantum of housing development that we expect to be delivered on each site. Each site that should provide housing has an indicative capacity to set out the quantum of housing development that could be delivered on the site and which is strongly encouraged. The key purpose of the minimum development capacities is to inform Southwark’s strategic growth projections and ensure the Council has a high-level understanding of the strategic distribution of development expected to come forward across the borough over the course of the plan period for housing, employment, retail, leisure and community uses and open space. The efficient use of land Policy P17 requires optimisation of the use of land for all developments in Southwark. The minimum capacities set out the quantum of development that we consider should deliver the principles of sustainable development as set out in the NPPF. Where there is an ambition to further optimise development capacity by including more housing. Residential capacity could be increased beyond the baseline number as part of the planning application through excellent design and careful consideration of the impact on character, amenity and local environment. This will be particularly in regard to scale, distribution and type of development which may require collaborative working and consideration of any adverse or cumulative impacts within the local environment. 215 Southwark Plan 2022 Employment and town centre services New Southwark Plan policy P29 (Office and business development) requires the employment floorspace in the Central Activities Zone (CAZ) ‘must’ be retained or increased. Additional employment uses, including offices and industrial uses will come forward in areas outside of the CAZ, including in opportunity areas and town centres. If the Site Allocation states that redevelopment ‘must’ re-provide or uplift employment and/or town centre services it means that this is an absolute requirement in order to meet the strategic needs of the borough. In many Site Allocations in the CAZ, housing is a ‘should’ which strongly encourages mixed use development where the reprovision or uplift of employment floorspace can be achieved. Housing The level of housing expected from development was estimated from the capacity remaining after other land use requirements are met. Our housing requirements are met through Site Allocations which ‘must’ provide housing. These sites will provide approximately 33,249 new homes. These are required to contribute to our 5 and 15 year supply of housing land. Site Allocations which ‘should’ provide housing result in an uplift of approximately 3,995 housing units in the borough.

Redevelopment will come forward in four phases as indicated in the site allocation. Through better urban design and architecture this will enable higher densities to be achieved and will bring more people to live in the action area core, whilst at the same time improving the quality of residents’ living conditions and the environment. The social rented and intermediate new homes should meet the space standards set out in Table 7 in Policy P14. The design of the new buildings should respect the wider area including preserving and enhancing the nearby conservation areas. A high quality pedestrian environment and improved landscaping with tree-lined streets should be delivered with a new local hub. Development should provide landscaping, public spaces and parks for the benefit of local residents. The amount of car parking in development proposals should not exceed 0.25 maximum spaces per home for the entire site redevelopment. Some sites may provide up to 0.4 maximum spaces per home where this is demonstrated to be required to enable rehousing of existing residents.|Col3| |||| ||The site location|| ||Approach to tall buildings|The tall building should comprise the district landmark building of between 15 and 20 storeys at the junction of Thurlow Street and Albany Road to mark the main entrance to the neighbourhood and symbolise the area’s regeneration; Local landmark buildings of between 10 and 15 storeys to mark the entrances to Portland Street, the King William IV and Chumleigh green fingers, and also the Amersham Site.

There will also be opportunities to integrate new homes as part of the redevelopment, making the most of the site’s proximity to Burgess Park. Redevelopment should seek to mitigate any negative impacts on surrounding residential areas. We are changing our approach to certain areas of industrial land to accommodate new mixed use neighbourhoods to provide new homes, jobs and community facilities for our residents. We require redevelopment of industrial land to include innovative new approaches for mixing industrial uses with new homes to help make the most efef ctive use of sites and respond to market demands. By increasing the levels of employment floorspace, accommodating existing businesses where possible and providing new jobs this will ensure new mixed use neighbourhoods are successful for securing the variety of types of employment space the borough needs. Burgess Park is valued for its outdoor wildlife, open space, play and open-air sports facilities and is unsuitable for new indoor built sports facilities. The development should establish green links into Burgess Park and from Chiswell Street to Newent Close, opening up access for new and existing residents with a new public realm ofef r throughout the site. Consideration should be given to focal points of activity and active frontages that encourage footfall.

Redevelopment or refurbishment of the site should introduce active frontages throughout the site, and retain and enhance frontages to Rye Lane, taking Rye Lane Peckham conservation area into consideration.

Assessment of the site concluded that development of up to 20 storeys could be appropriate in this location. The site is within the setting of Rye Lane Peckham and Peckham Hill Street conversation areas, so any taller development should be set back from the Rye Lane shopping frontage, towards the eastern end of site, to mitigate its impact. Development massing should be directed to the east of the site to minimise impact on the view to the City from the Bussey Building rooftop. In any case a 20 storey height restriction on development proposals should be observed.

Mixed-use development should be centred around the retention of the historic Bussey building and should include new public realm improvements to provide space for new residents, workers and visitors. No residential uses should be located on Bournemouth Road. The continued use of the Bussey building by creative and artistic enterprises will be supported and encouraged. In the past few years a number of creative industries have appeared on the site and in the Bussey building. There is opportunity to build on this and create a new cultural and creative quarter for Peckham to attract visitors from outside the area. Opportunities to improve and extend links west to Rye Lane and north-south through the railway arches should be explored. Opportunities to create improved public realm and a possible public square/space within the site should be maximised. The town centre sufef rs from a lack of east-west pedestrian routes. The opening of the Copeland Industrial Park and 1-27 Bournemouth Road to Rye lane and through the site will encourage greater pedestrian flow to surrounding residential areas and relieve pedestrian congestion along Rye Lane. Development should provide a second north-south link through the railway arches to the north and linking development sites which will provide further relief to Rye Lane. The size of the site provides the opportunity for a variety of larger floorplate retail units which are lacking in the town centre.

Application of the Borough Views Policy 1.1 We will apply the Borough Views policy on all development that may have an impact on the significance of our designated views. 2. View Definitions and Terminology 2.1 Methodology The methodology and terminology we have used to identify and define our Borough Views is consistent with the methodology used for the Mayor of London’s adopted London Views Management Framework (LVMF) (2012). 2.2 Scope of Policy The scope of our Borough View policy relates only to our borough. It does not cross beyond our borough boundaries or designate policy for the City of London, the London Borough of Lambeth or the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. However, as the focal point of our London Panorama and two Linear Views is St Paul’s Cathedral, which lies within City of London, we illustrate how the view geometry extends from our borough boundary across the City of London to the Cathedral. 2.3 Assessment Points Each of our Borough Views has a defined Assessment Point. This is the location from which any proposed development within the view must be assessed. Each Assessment Point has coordinates (Easting, Northing and Height (AOD)) that define its exact location. Accurate Visual Representation (AVR) photography must utilise these coordinates with a camera height of 1.6m for consistent analysis. Proposals should also use the Assessment Point to understand and assess heritage significance within views by undertaking a Qualitative Visual Assessment using the Phase A ‘Baseline Analysis’ and a Phase B ‘Assessment of Impact ‘that is defined in Historic England’s Seeing History in the View (2011). 489 Southwark Plan 2022 2.4 Landmark Viewing Corridor (LVC) A Landmark Viewing Corrdidor is a A Landmark Viewing Corridor is a triangular area that lies between an Assessment Point and a Strategically Important Landmark. In Southwark, our London Panorama and two Linear views all focus on St Paul’s Cathedral as the Strategically Important Landmark. The Threshold Planes we have defined for our Landmark Viewing Corridors are derived from the direct lines of sight linking the viewer at our Assessment Points to specific target points on St Paul’s Cathedral. Development that exceeds a Threshold Plane is likely to harm a viewer’s ability to recognise and appreciate St Paul’s Cathedral and is therefore likely to be refused. Applications will be expected to demonstrate that this is the case. If existing buildings located within a Landmark Viewing Corridor are demolished, any replacement building should be designed so that no part of the building envelope or element fixed to its structure exceeds the Threshold Plane. Image: Indicative Illustration of a 45m threshold plane at St Paul’s Cathedral 2.5 Wider Setting Consultation Area (WSCA) Each Landmark Viewing Corridor is enclosed on both sides by two Wider Setting Consultation Areas that are in the foreground and middle ground of the view. These areas are integral to the viewer’s ability to 490 Southwark Plan 2022 recongise and appreciate St Paul's Cathedral and are sensitive to new development. Any development that exceeds the Threshold Plan of the Wider Setting Consultation Area must be designed and sited so that it preserves or enhances the viewer's ability to recongise and appreciate St Paul's Cathedral Applications will be expect to demonstrate that this is the case. We have not proposed Background Assessment Areas as part of our Wider Setting Consultation Areas. This is because Background Assessment Areas for our London Panorama and Linear views would extend to the north of St Paul’s Cathedral which is an area beyond our borough boundary (City of London, London Borough of Camden), and therefore beyond the scope and remit of this Plan. 2.6 Borough View geometry for Landmark Viewing Corridors (LVC) and Wider Setting Consultation Areas (WSCA1 and 2) The Landmark Viewing Corridors (LVC) and Wider Setting Consultation Areas (WSCA1 and 2) are each defined by a series of three coordinates that create a three triangular-shaped assessment areas. The coordinates for each piece of geometry are set out in in Section 5 of this annex and will be available to download from our website.

It is important to note that the Curvature of the Earth compensation will require more detailed analysis to determine the precise Threshold Plane that applies if a site lies within a Landmark Viewing Corridor. New development proposals should form attractive features in their own right and their bulk and shape should not be based solely on the parameters set by the requirements and constraints of the Landmark Viewing Corridors and Wider Setting Consultation Areas. 2.8 London View Management Framework and St Paul’s Heights Designation Four of our borough views benefit from the existing height thresholds and view geometry that is already adopted in the Mayor of London’s London Views Management Framework (LVMF) and the City of London’s 492 Southwark Plan 2022 existing St Paul’s Heights planning policy designation. Both of these designations restrict the height of new development around St Paul’s Cathedral that could impact or harm its setting and limit the ability to appreciate and recognise its significance. Both of these designations should ensure that development within the City of London that could harm the significance of our own Borough Views will be restricted. 2.9 Working with Others We will continue to work with London Boroughs, Historic England and the Statutory Consultees identified in the LVMF to ensure that development that may impact upon the significance of our Borough Views is appropriate and has regard to the purpose and scope of our view designations. We will also work closely with adjoining London Boroughs and have regard to their adopted local or borough views that may be affected by development in Southwark. 493 Southwark Plan 2022 3. What We Require from Applicants Where development proposals would appear within a designated Borough View, applicants must submit the following information as part of their Townscape Visual Impact Assessments (TVIAs). 3.1 Scoping Process Applicants should determine and illustrate whether their proposal is likely to impact upon any of our designated Borough Views. Taller proposals may be visible in a number of designated views. Consideration should be given to the foreground and middle ground of the view, the relationship with a specified landmark and the impact upon the general skyline. 3.2 A description of the proposal and Qualitative Visual Assessment Applicants should describe how their proposal would impact a designated Borough View. The description should have regard to: - The designated Borough View Landmark Viewing Corridors and Wider Setting Consultation Areas - The London View Management Framework views - Any landmarks and existing features in the view - Heritage assets and townscape - The skyline and the relationship with existing, proposed or consented developments, especially tall buildings - Lighting, seasonal changes, the weather, shadowing and any other material considerations that may be visible within or impact the view. A Qualitative Visual Assessment using the Phase A ‘Baseline Analysis’ and a Phase B ‘Assessment of Impact‘ that is defined in Historic England’s Seeing History in the View (2011) will also be required to ensure we have a clear understanding of any impact on heritage significance. The assessment should include a ‘Magnitude of Impact against Value’ assessment. 494 Southwark Plan 2022 Borough Views Annex 1, Map 1: Borough Views Map 495 Southwark Plan 2022 4.

      "content": "This glossary provides guidance on the meaning of terms which are specific to the Southwark Plan 2022. Refer to the National Planning Policy Framework and the London Plan for terms not defined here. Action Areas are the parts of Southwark which are expected to undergo change in the coming years. These include Peckham and Nunhead, Old Kent Road, Canada Water, Camberwell, Aylesbury and Bermondsey. We may produce Area Action Plans or supplementary planning documents to ensure that development happens in the most beneficial way within our Action Areas. Action Area Cores are the areas within Action Areas with the capacity for significant change in the coming years. Active design is an approach to the development of buildings, streets, and neighbourhoods that uses architecture and urban planning to make daily physical activity more accessible and inviting. Active frontages add interest, life and vitality to the street and public realm. Buildings should have active frontages that have: - Frequent doors and windows without blank walls - Articulated facades with bays and porches - Lively internal uses visible from the outside, or spilling onto the street - Concentrations of activity at particular points. Air Quality Neutral neutral means that a development must neutralise nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM10) emissions against the benchmarks set out in the Mayor’s Sustainable Design and Construction SPG. Alteration Work intended to change the function or appearance of a place Amenity A positive element or elements that contribute to the overall character or enjoyment of an area. For example, open land, trees, historic buildings and the inter-relationship between them, or less tangible factors such as tranquility. Amenity Space is a garden or balcony that is used for the day-to day activities of a household, such as clothes drying, relaxation, play and gardening. Ancient Woodland has been continually wooded since 1600 and is generally considered to have never been cleared since prehistoric times. These old woodlands on London Clay feature English Oak forming the prevalent tree canopy, interspersed with Hornbeam, Ash, Wild Cherry, Field Maple, Crab Apple and the less common Wild Service Tree. Below the canopy, the under-storey typically comprises of Hazel, Yew, Hawthorn, Holly and Willow. Archaeological Priority Zones (or Area) are areas where there is potential for significant archaeological remains. Planning applications within these areas must be accompanied by an archaeological assessment and evaluation of the site, including an assessment of the potential impact of the proposed development on the significance of archaeological remains. Archaeology refers to buried archaeological finds, layers and features which are buried below the ground and not visible. Archaeological interest there will be archaeological interest in a heritage asset if it holds, or potentially may hold, evidence of past human activity worthy of expert investigation at some point. Heritage assets with archaeological interest are the primary source of evidence about the substance and evolution of places and of the people and cultures that made them (NPPF definition). There can be an archaeological interest in buildings and landscapes as well as earthworks and buried remains. Architectural interest in listed buildings this refers to buildings that are important to the nation because of their architectural design, decoration and craftsmanship. Important examples of significance includes plan forms, particular building types and techniques such as using cast iron, the early use of concrete and early prefabricated buildings. Area Action Plans are development plan documents that provide a planning framework for a designated Action Area. Asset of Community Value is a building or other land which it main used currently or was recently used to further the social wellbeing or social interests of the local community. The Localism Act 2011, Chapter 3 states that ‘social interests’ include cultural, recreational and sporting interests. Authority Monitoring Report (AMR) is a report produced by the council to monitor the performance of planning policies using a range of different indicators, including housing delivery. Borough Open Land is designated open space of borough importance. It must meet all of the following criteria: An area of borough importance to Southwark; A clearly distinguishable open space; Land that contains features or landscapes of historic or recreational value at a borough level; It must not be Metropolitan Open Land. Building Research Establishment Assessment Method (BREEAM) measures the environmental performance of commercial buildings by assessing waster, waste, energy and travel usage. Built Heritage means all the heritage places and features that survive as buildings or structures above ground and are visible and visitable. Business space refers to uses including offices (Use Class B1), factories (Use Class B2) and warehouses (Use Class B8). Carbon footprint is the amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organisation in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product Carbon neutrality, or having a net zero carbon footprint, refers to achieving net zero carbon dioxide emissions by balancing carbon emissions with carbon removal (often through carbon offsetting) or simply eliminating carbon emissions altogether (the transition to a “post-carbon economy”). It is used in the context of carbon dioxide-releasing processes associated with transportation, energy production, agriculture and industrial processes. Central Zone Areas areas are mixed use areas including a range of commercial uses alongside housing. They are typically characterised by denser development and tend to have excellent levels of public transport accessibility Circular economy is an economic model in which resources are kept in use at the highest level possible for as long as possible in order to maximise value and reduce waste, moving away from the traditional linear economic model of ‘make, use, dispose’. Climate change is a pattern of change affecting global or regional climate, as measured by average temperature and rainfall, and how often extreme weather events like heatwaves or heavy rains happen. This variation may be caused by both natural processes and by humans. Global warming is an informal term used to describe climate change caused by humans Climate change adaptation is adjustments to natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic factors or their effects, including from changes in rainfall and rising temperatures, which moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. Climate Emergency We will do all we can to make the borough carbon neutral by 2030. This includes cutting the council’s carbon emissions, addressing air quality and protecting biodiversity to respond to the imminence of the impacts of climate change. Climate change mitigation is action to reduce the impact of human activity on the climate system, primarily through reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Code for Sustainable Homes (CfSH) is a national standard to guide the sustainable design and construction of homes. The Code was withdrawn on March 2015 and only applies to legacy cases. The Code gives a sustainability rating to development which ranges from 1(*) to 6(****). The higher the rating the more sustainable a home is. The assessment includes efficiency in energy, water, waste, materials, ecology and surface water run-off. Co-living developments are similar to student halls of residence but not restricted to students. Typically a collective living scheme will be a large block which provides a range of communal areas that fulfil different functions (such as libraries, kitchens, gyms, games rooms etc.) which are available to all residents. Residents typically rent a small ensuite bedroom. Unlike halls of residence, collective living is intended to be a primary residence. Combined heat and power The combined production of electricity and usable heat is known as Combined Heat and Power (CHP). Steam or hot water, which would otherwise be rejected when electricity alone is produced, is used for space or process heating. Community facilities are defined by the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 and its subsequent amendments. Community facilities include: - Leisure and culture facilities (including arts, entertainment and sport facilities) - Community centres and meeting places (including places of worship) - Libraries - Facilities for children (from nursery provision to youth clubs) - Education (including adult education) - Healthcare facilities Conservation is the process of maintaining and managing change to a heritage asset in a way that sustains and, where appropriate, enhances its significance (NPPF definition). Conservation Areas are areas of special architectural or historic interest whose character or appearance is protected. They have to be formally designated under the provisions of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. Context refers to the setting of a site or area, including factors such as townscape, built form, land use, activities, heritage and vehicular and pedestrian movement. Council house is a type of Social Rented Housing where the Council is the landlord. Creative and cultural industries is classified by the Department for Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) and includes the following industries: Advertising, architecture, the art and antiques market, crafts, design, designer fashion, film and video production, interactive leisure software, music, the performing arts, publishing, software and computer services, and television and radio production. Critical Drainage Areas are areas where multiple and interlinked sources of flood risk cause flooding in one or more Local Flood Risk Zones during severe weather (usually a hydrological catchment). Density is the amount of internal floor space of a building in relation to an area of land. Density can be expressed in terms of plot ratio (floor to area ratio (FAR)) for commercial and mixed use development and number of units or habitable rooms per hectare for residential development. Decentralised energy A range of definitions exists for decentralised energy. In the context of the London Plan, it refers to low- and zero-carbon power and/or heat generated and delivered within London. This includes microgeneration, such as photovoltaics on individual buildings, through to large-scale heat networks. Designation is the recognition of particular heritage value(s) of a significant place by giving it formal status under law or policy intended to sustain those values Designated Heritage Asset is a term used in the NPPF to refer to heritage places that have been selected under a range of relevant legislation or criteria for formal recognition of their heritage value and significance, including registration, listing, scheduling and inscription. Dwelling may be a house, bungalow, flat, maisonette or converted farm building. Ecological resilience refers to the ability of an ecosystem to maintain key functions and processes in the face of stresses or pressures, by resisting and then adapting to change. Embodied carbon / energy / emissions - The total life cycle carbon / energy / greenhouse gases used in the collection, manufacture, transportation, assembly, recycling and disposal of a given material or product. Emissions are any release of gases such as carbon dioxide which cause global warming, a major cause of climate change Energy recovery from waste means the conversion of (non-recyclable) waste into usable heat, electricity, or fuel through a variety of processes Exemplary standard of design comprises of an excellent standard of living accommodation; and a significant contribution to environmental improvements in the area. Equality Implications are the responsibility of public bodies for ensuring that their plans, policies and activities do not unfairly discriminate against a group protected by equalities legislation. It is the responsibility of the public bodies that we advise to ensure that they have paid due regard to local equality implications when implementing our advice. Evaluation (archaeology) an archaeological field evaluation is the initial stage of investigation, by the excavation of archaeological trial trenches. It is carried out in support of a planning application to enable an informed decision. Evaluation will seek to define and characterise the archaeological remains on a site. Where archaeological remains are discovered or predicted, and the proposed scheme has an impact on those remains, further archaeological work will be necessary. This may be a mitigation strategy for remains that would be undisturbed, full excavation, or a combination of the two. Evaluation can involve different methods and practices. Evaluation can also be non-intrusive, for example, geophysical, chemical or survey techniques or intrusive, for example, auger, borehole, monitoring of geotechnical work, test pits or trenches. Flatted development refers to homes which have neighbouring homes above and/or below. Maisonettes and duplexes are flatted development. Flood Risk Zones are areas at risk of flooding. Flood Risk Zones are categorized as Zone 1 (low probability), Zone 2 (medium probability), Zone 3a (high probability) and Zone 3b (the functional floodplain). Freedom of Information we are subject to the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 which provide a general right of access to information we hold or for which we are responsible. We may provide the information you have supplied in response to a request made under this legislation, subject to any exemptions which apply. We will consult with external parties as necessary prior to releasing information. Futureproofing Ensuring that designs are adaptable and take account of expected future changes. For example, ensuring a heating system is designed to be compatible with a planned district heat network to allow connection in future. Global warming is the steady rise in global average temperature in recent decades, which experts believe is largely caused by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions Good Growth refers to the Good Growth by Design set out by the Mayor of London to deliver a united programme of work to enhance the design of buildings and neighbourhoods for all Londoners. This means new development should benefit everyone who lives here. As such, it should be sensitive to the local context. It should also be environmentally sustainable and physically accessible. Green and brown roofs are roofs with vegetation cover and/or landscaping over a drainage layer. They are designed to provide insulation, increase biodiversity and retain rain water and reduce the volume of surface water runoff. Green building (also known as green construction or sustainable building) refers to both a structure and the application of processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building’s lifecycle: from planning to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. This requires close cooperation of the contractor, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages. Green infrastructure is a network of habitats which is often multifunctional and can provide a range of benefits to improve mental health, active lifestyles, recreation, food growing, enhanced biodiversity and ecological resilience, flood risk management, temperature regulation and improved air and water quality. Green links are areas of linked but separate open spaces and the footpaths between them. Gross External Area (GEA) is the whole area of a building taking each floor into account. Gross Internal Area (GIA) is the enclosed area of a building within the external walls taking each floor into account and excluding the thickness of the external walls. Group value (buildings) refers to buildings which have an important architectural or historical unity or are a fine example of planning. This includes squares, terraces, model villages and model courtyard farms. The list includes other structures of special architectural or historical interest such as monuments, bridges, garden buildings, telephone kiosks, gate piers, walls, fountains, milestones and gravestones. Harm in planning terms means something that may damage a heritage asset or result in a loss of significance. This should not be permitted. Heritage includes all inherited resources which people value for reasons beyond mere utility. These are cultural inherited assets which people identify and value as a reflection and expression of their evolving knowledge, beliefs and traditions, and of their understanding of the beliefs and traditions of others. Heritage (‘place’ or ‘asset’) the term ‘heritage place’ goes beyond physical form to involve all of the individual characteristics that can contribute to giving somewhere a distinctive ‘sense of place’. Certain places hold special meanings for people and a strong ‘sense of place’ that can be deeply felt by local inhabitants and appreciated by visitors. It reflects the knowledge, beliefs and traditions of diverse communities and provides a sense of inclusivity, continuity and a source of identity. It is a social and economic asset and a resource for learning and enjoyment. Understanding the historic character of a place is an essential starting point for deciding its future. Heritage (natural) includes inherited habitats, species, ecosystems, geology and landforms, including those in and under water, to which people attach value. Higher education provider is defined as an education institution that provides a designated course that has been approved by the Department for Education for higher education study which allows the student to apply for government-financed student loans. Higher education study is at qualification Level 4 or above (i.e. above A-level or equivalent). The Office for Students provides a register listing all the English higher education providers that it officially recognises. This register can be used to determine if a higher education provider deliver designated courses and thus satisfies the above definition. Hierarchy of town centres is a ranking of town centres based on size and importance. The three types of town centres in Southwark are Major Centres, District Centres (both defined in the London Plan) and Local Town Centres. Historic Environment is a very general term used to refer to everywhere around us that has something significant about it. It is defined by the NPPF as: ‘all aspects of the environment resulting from the interaction between people and places through time, including all surviving physical remains of past human activity, whether visible, buried or submerged and landscaped and planted of managed flora.’ Historic Environment Record (HER/GLHER) is a public, map-based data set, primarily intended to inform the management of the historic environment. This includes information services that seek to provide access to comprehensive and dynamic resources relating to the historic environment of a defined geographic area for public benefit and use. Historic England maintains the Historic Environment Record for Greater London. Historical interest (buildings) refers to buildings that have important aspects of the nation’s social, economic, cultural or military history, such as industrial buildings, railway stations, schools, hospitals, theatres, and town halls. House is a self contained residential dwelling. Houses can be detached, semi detached or terraced. Infrastructure includes educational infrastructure (such as early years facilities, schools, facilities for children and young people), social infrastructure (such as community buildings, faith premises, leisure facilities, cultural facilities), health infrastructure (such as health and emergency services), utilities (power, gas, water, sewerage and telecommunications (digital)), transport infrastructure (such as roads, railways, bridges, cycle routes, walking routes, tunnels) and environmental infrastructure such as (green links (open spaces), Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDs), Waste Management facilities and consolidation centres). Integrated Impact Assessment is a method of estimating the potential environmental, social or economic implications of planning policies. Planning documents must be assessed to identify the extent to which they may have any unfair impacts on groups in the community, such as people of different gender, ethnic group, age, religion, belief, sexual orientation, or disability. Landscape refers to the character and appearance of land, including its shape, topography, form, ecology and natural features. Layout refers to the way buildings, routes and open spaces are placed in relation to each other. Listed Building is a building or structure which is considered to be of ‘special architectural or historic interest’. This includes a wide variety of structures and buildings. There are three grades of listing depending on the importance of the building. Local Town Centres are the smallest town centres in the Town Centre Hierarchy. Local Town Centres have good access and include a small group of shops and services serving the needs of the local community. They typically have shops like newsagents, off-licenses, general grocery stores and post office and occasionally a pharmacy, a hairdresser and other small shops of a local nature. Local Development Scheme (LDS) sets out the council’s timetable for preparing planning documents over a three year period and the purpose and scope of each document. Locally Listed Building is a building, structure or feature which is not statutorily listed but is important in the local context owing to its special architectural or historic interest or its townscape or group value. The protection of local heritage is important because it enhances the value of Southwark’s built environment, but also maintains a sense of local distinctiveness which can assist with regeneration and place-making. London Plan is the Mayor’s strategic development plan for London and it forms part of Southwark’s Development Plan. Maintenance includes routine work necessary to keep the fabric of a place in good order. Material (assessment) is relevant to and having a substantial effect on a decision, therefore demanding consideration. Major development means development involving any one or more of the following: - the winning and working of minerals or the use of land for mineral-working deposits; or - waste development; or - the provision of homes where the number of homes to be provided is 10 or more; or the development is to be carried out on a site having an area of 0.5 hectares or more; or - the provision of a building or buildings where the floor space to be created by the development is 1,000 square metres or more; or - development carried out on a site having an area of 1 hectare or more. Massing refers to the combined effect of the height, bulk and silhouette of a building or group of buildings. Meanwhile uses refers to a range of temporary uses of vacant buildings of land for social or economic gain until they can be brought back into commercial use. Metropolitan Open Land is a designation equivalent to the Green Belt. The designation is intended to protect areas of landscape, recreation, nature conservation and scientific interest which are strategically important. Mitigation is a measure introduced to avoid or reduce an effect. Natural Capital refers to all the distinctive natural features of the landscape that add to the sense of character and distinctiveness of a place. Net Internal Area (NIA) is the Gross Internal Area of a building less the floor areas taken up by lobbies, enclosed machinery rooms on the roof, stairs and escalators, mechanical and electrical services, lifts, columns, toilet areas (other than in domestic property), ducts, and risers. Net Carbon Neutral This is equivalent for Net Carbon Zero target for the purposes of this plan. Net Zero-carbon Activity that causes no net release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Observed Adverse Effect (Level of noise) refers to an observed harmful level of noise exposure. A significant observed adverse effect level is the level of noise exposure above which significant adverse effects on health and quality of life may occur. The lowest observed adverse effect level is the level of noise exposure above which adverse effects on health and quality of life can be detected. No observed effect level is the level of noise exposure below which no effect at all on health or quality of life can be detected. Other Open Space (OOS ) refers to a designation that is not MOL or BOL, but meets one of the following criteria in that it is: an allotment; a public open space such as public parks and gardens; playing fields and sports ground whether publicly or privately owned; a private open space which is of benefit to the local community; open space that has been created and secured through planning obligations; or a site of ecological importance. Point of landmark significance is where a number of important routes converge, where there is a concentration of activity and which is or will be the focus of views from several directions. Potable water is water that is safe to drink. Preserve is to keep safe from harm. Protected species are a species of animal or plant which it is forbidden by law to harm or destroy. Private (or market) housing is available to either buy or rent privately on the open market. Public realm is the space between and within buildings that is publicly accessible, including streets, squares, forecourts, parks and open spaces. Public transport includes buses, trains and river boats that operate on fixed routes for fixed fares. Publicly accessible is accessible from the public realm, including streets, squares, forecourts, parks and open spaces. Registered Providers (RPs) are housing providers that are registered with the Homes and Communities Agency. Most RPs are housing associations, but some RPs are trusts, co-operatives and companies. Renewable energy is energy that is collected from renewable resources, which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas: electricity generation, air and water heating/cooling, transportation, and rural (offgrid) energy services. Restoration is to return a place to a known earlier state, on the basis of compelling evidence, without conjecture. Retail, community or leisure uses: - E(a) Display or retail sale of goods, other than hot food - E(b) Sale of food and drink for consumption (mostly) on the premises - E(c) Provision of: o E(c)(i) Financial services, o E(c)(ii) Professional services (other than health or medical services), or o E(c)(iii) Other appropriate services in a commercial, business or service locality - E(d) Indoor sport, recreation or fitness (not involving motorised vehicles or firearms) - E(e) Provision of medical or health services (except the use of premises attached to the residence of the consultant or practitioner) - E(f) Creche, day nursery or day centre (not including a residential use) - F1(b) Display of works of art (otherwise than for sale or hire) - F1(c) Museums - F1(d) Public libraries or public reading rooms - F1(e) Public halls or exhibition halls - F1(f) Public worship or religious instruction (or in connection with such use) - F1(g) Law courts - F2(b) Halls or meeting places for the principal use of the local community - F2(c) Areas or places for outdoor sport or recreation (not involving motorised vehicles or firearms) - F2(d) Indoor or outdoor swimming pools or skating rinks - Appropriate sui generis town centre uses (for example: public house, wine bar or drinking establishment, a venue for live music performance, a cinema, a concert hall, a bingo hall, a dance hall, subject to site specific circumstances) Saturation means a particular type of use (e.g. night clubs, bars or HMOs for instance) has became too dominant in a particular area which is causing negative impacts on local amenity. Scale refers to the relationship of the relative size of a building or structure to another. Scheduled Ancient Monument (SAM) is a legally protected (generally archaeological) site that is considered to be of national importance. Scheduled monuments are described here because of the high level of legal protection that is afforded them. Not all of Southwark’s SAMs are archaeological monuments, for example the pumping engine house for Brunel’s Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe. Also, not all scheduled sites are ancient. Scheduled Monument is protected by law, and any development that affects a scheduled monument requires formal written Scheduled Monument Consent (SMC) from the Secretary of State for DCMS. Historic England’s Inspector of Ancient Monuments gives advice to the government on each application and administers the consent system. In assessing applications, the Secretary of State will aim to ensure that the significance of protected sites is safeguarded for the long term. Secured by Design is a police initiative that seeks to encourage the construction industry to adopt crime prevention measures in the design of developments, to assist in reducing the opportunity for, and fear of, crime. Setting of a heritage asset is the surroundings in which a heritage asset is experienced. Its extent is not fixed and may change as the asset and its surroundings evolve. Elements of a setting may make a positive or negative contribution to the significance of an asset, may affect the ability to appreciate that significance or may be neutral. Sensitivity is the likelihood of typical development impacts causing significant harm to assets of National, Regional and Local Interest. Sensitivity is closely allied to significance and potential but also takes account of an asset’s vulnerability and fragility. Significance is the value of a heritage asset to this and future generations because of its heritage interest. That interest may be archaeological, architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical presence, but also from its setting. Social Regeneration is about ensuring that the places where people live, now and in the future, create new opportunities, promote wellbeing and reduce inequalities so that people have better lives, in stronger communities, and achieve their potential. Social rent equivalent in a private rented scheme (PRS) are rents calculated in the same way as social rent, using the formula set out in the HCA Rent Standard Guidance. These homes are not required to be managed by a registered provider but will be secured in perpetuity through a section 106 agreement. Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINCS) provide valuable wildlife habitat and opportunities for experiencing nature. These are important in helping local plant and animal specifies to survive. Sites are classified according to whether they have London- wide, borough-wide and local importance. Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) are small businesses which typically operate from business units with a floorspace under 235 sqm. Statement of Community Involvement sets out how the council will consult people on the preparation of planning documents and on planning applications. Strategic Flood Risk Assessments (SFRA) assess risks from flooding, including from the River Thames, surface water runoff and drainage overflow. Student is a person following a course in higher education as recognised by the Office for Students (as defined in the London Plan). Studios and bedsits are homes with only one main room with no separate bedroom. They are not suitable for meeting general housing needs. Suburban Zone areas are predominantly residential areas characterised by lower density development and tend to have relatively poor public transport. Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) explain how current planning policies in the Local Plan will be applied. They also contain background information applicants may find useful when preparing their planning applications. Sustainable is a state of being capable of meeting present needs without compromising ability to meet future needs. Sustainable drainage system is an environmentally-friendly way of dealing with surface water runoff to avoid problems associated with conventional drainage practice. These problems include exacerbating flooding. This approach may also be termed “SuDS” (or sustainable urban drainage systems). Temperature regulation (see Global warming). Tall Buildings are above 30m except where they are 25m in the Thames Special Policy Area, and also where they are significantly higher than surrounding buildings or their emerging context. Transparent means something is open to public scrutiny. Travellers and Gypsies (definition from the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (August 2021)) - Persons of nomadic habit of life whatever their race or origin, including such persons who on grounds only of their own or their family’s or dependants’ educational or health needs or old age have ceased to travel temporarily, but excluding members of an organised group of travelling showpeople or circus people travelling together as such. Town centre uses included housing, retail development (such as warehouse clubs and factory outlet centres), leisure, entertainment facilities, sport and recreation uses (such as cinemas, restaurants, drive-through restaurants, bars and pubs, night-clubs, casinos, health and fitness centres, indoor bowling centres, and bingo halls), offices and arts, culture and tourism (such as theatres, museums, galleries and concert halls, hotels and conference facilities) development. Undesignated Heritage Asset places which do not have formal recognition, but may nevertheless be demonstrably equivalent in value to formally recognised assets, and in some cases should be treated in the same way. Southwark has a range of undesignated heritage assets and we have selected the key ones below. The value of places can change over time and heritage value and significance may become apparent when new evidence or knowledge is revealed. Urban design involves the design of buildings, spaces and landscapes at a variety of scales. It can involve the establishment of frameworks and processes which facilitate successful development. Urban grain is the pattern and arrangement of the plots, streets and blocks. Urban Zone areas are predominantly residential areas characterised by relatively dense development and tend to have higher levels of public transport accessibility. Value includes an aspect of worth or importance, attached by people to the quality of places. Waste management facilitie s are facilities where waste is processed including sorting, composting, recycling, and biological treatment. Water sensitive urban design** is an approach to designing the built environment that seeks to provide integrated solutions to flood risk management, sustainable water use and supply and the improvement of water quality.",

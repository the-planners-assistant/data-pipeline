      "content": "2013 – 2026 (formerly the Core Strategy) March 2013 Consolidated with alterations since 2017 FOREWORD It is with great pleasure that I am able to present this, the first document of the Council’s Local Plan. The Local Plan Strategic Policies will shape the location and scale of development in the borough from now until 2026. Great care and attention has been taken in setting out responses to the plethora of challenges and opportunities that exist in Haringey. The Local Plan, as the spatial planning document, tasked with fulfilling the aims of the Council’s Sustainable Community Strategy, has a key role in shaping the future of the borough, and fulfilling the Council’s vision of creating a place for diverse communities that people are proud to belong to. This Plan has been shaped by ongoing consultation and engagement involving local people, businesses and communities, as well as service providers and key stakeholders. Through this engagement, the Council will continue to build on these relationships to help deliver the aims of sustaining and improving the life chances of our residents, especially those who are most vulnerable, and in developing a borough which is a good place to be born, learn, work, have fun and grow old. The Local Plan will enable the regeneration of the growth areas at Tottenham and Haringey Heartlands, while protecting the amenity and appearance of the borough’s conservation areas. It sets out how and where new development can be accommodated to deliver the housing challenge facing the borough. New infrastructure has been identifed to deliver high quality services to existing and future residents. The land to create opportunities for local businesses has been safeguarded, and the future shopping needs of local residents’ planned for. A commitment to sustainable design and a low carbon future has been made. It is hoped that over the lifetime of this Plan, the borough will flourish as a place to live, work, and visit and that through the positive impacts of new development, local resident’s quality of life will grow. Further work is necessary now to ensure that the policies set out here are put into place effectively, with a complementary Development Management Policies document, and a range of topic based supplementary documents, coming forward in the near future. Together these will ensure that Haringey remains a place for diverse communities that people are proud to belong to.

          "content": "01 1.1 Introduction 1.2 Haringey in London and north London 1.3 Making Haringey Distinctive 1.4 Challenges facing Haringey 1.5 Vision and Objectives 1.6 Structure of the Local Plan: Strategic Policies 3 What is the Haringey Local Plan: Strategic Policies? 1.1.1 The Local Plan: Strategic Policies (referred to as the Local Plan throughout the document), sets out a vision and key policies for the future development of the borough up to 2026. It takes forward the priorities of Haringey’s Sustainable Community Strategy and other plans and strategies, to identify a vision for Haringey as a place to live, work and visit, and contains key policies and an implementation framework to deliver the vision. 1.1.2 The Local Plan outlines how the Council will address local and strategic development needs including housing, employment, leisure, and retail provision. It goes beyond traditional land use planning and considers other plans and strategies that influence the use of land and the way that places around us look and work. The Local Plan covers the physical aspects of location and land use but also addresses other factors that make places attractive, sustainable and successful, such as social and economic matters. Preparation of these policies has been subject to a sustainability appraisal. This promotes sustainable strategies and policies through an assessment of their social, environmental and economic impacts. 1.1.3 Haringey’s Local Plan gives spatial interpretation to the Council’s adopted Sustainable Community Strategy’s key outcomes: - People at the heart of change; - An environmentally sustainable future; - Economic vitality and prosperity shared by all; - Safer for all; - Healthier people with a better quality of life; and - People and customer focused. 1.1.4 The Local Plan also takes into consideration: - new and emerging government policy; - the London Plan; - local issues and priorities facing the borough; and - future challenges such as climate change. 4 Consultation on a Partial Review of the Haringey Local Plan Strategic Policies The Strategic Policies document 1.1.5 Haringey’s Strategic Policies Development Plan Document (DPD) was adopted by the Council in March 2013. The purpose of the document is to set out the long term vision of how Haringey, and the places within it, should develop by 2026 and sets out the Council’s strategy for achieving that vision. In particular, it identifies the broad locations for delivering housing and other strategic development needs such as employment, retail, leisure, community facilities and other uses. It also sets the context for the other policy documents that make up the Haringey Local Plan, including: - The Site Allocations DPD; - The Development Management DPD; - The Tottenham Area Action Plan; and - The Wood Green Area Action Plan 1.1.6 The first three of the above Local Plan documents are currently in the process of being prepared and alongside the schedule of alterations to the Strategic Policies, will all be taken forward in tandem for pre-submission consultation and submission to the Secretary of State for Independent Examination in Public. Why are the Strategic Policies being reviewed? 1.1.7 Since the Strategic Policies were adopted there have been a number of changes in the overarching planning framework, including at the national and regional level, which affect planning locally. These changes include: - The release of 2011 Census data, which set out higher than previously projected population growth figures for London, prompting the Mayor of London to prepare and adopt Further Alterations to the London Plan (FALP), and subsequently update the whole London Plan, that significantly increased Haringey’s strategic housing target from 820 homes per annum to 1,502 homes per annum, effective from April 2015 – an 83% increase; - Changes to permitted development rights, which give greater scope for the permitted change of use of offices, shops and warehouses to go to residential development, as well as provision for larger residential extensions; - Changes to the National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG), in particular, the methodology for assessing needs, most recently for Gypsy and Traveller accommodation needs, as well as for seeking affordable housing from small developments, potentially putting it at odds with Haringey’s Local Plan Strategic Policy SP2(7), which requires residential schemes for 1-9 units to provide 20% affordable housing; - The introduction of both a Mayoral and Haringey Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL), which changed the way in which new development contributed financially or in kind towards the provision of strategic and local infrastructure required to support sustainable communities; - The preparation of further key local evidence base studies, including an Open Spaces and Biodiversity study, an Urban Characterisation Study, and a Strategic Housing Market Assessment, as well as updates to existing studies on Employment Land, Development Viability and the Pan-London wide Strategic 5 Housing Land Availability Assessment. These new and updated studies reflect the current state of the environment with respect to the local economy and demands for various land uses, which has changed significantly since the recession when the bulk of studies to inform the Strategic Policies were undertaken; and - The new Housing Zone designation to be applied to Tottenham Hale, which will see significant public and private investment committed to the area to unlock its development potential and accelerate housing delivery, prompting the Council to prepare a comprehensive regeneration framework for the area along with a dedicated Area Action Plan. 1.1.8 In light of these changes, the Council has identified a number of alterations, the vast majority of which are factual updates, which need to be made to the Local Plan: Strategic Policies to bring it up to date and ensure it remains consistent with the current national and regional planning position. Why is the Council only proposing a partial review of the Strategic Policies? 1.1.9 The Haringey Strategic Policies have already been subject to significant public scrutiny in their preparation, including an independent Examination in Public, following which they were found to be sound and in general conformity with both national policy and the London Plan. There have been no changes to national planning policy since the Strategic Policies were adopted (only to its supporting guidance), and the alterations to the London Plan were limited to addressing the implications of London’s population growth on housing needs, and therefore did not alter the regional spatial strategy for how the Capital is to manage its growth and development over the next 20 years. The vast bulk of Haringey’s Strategic Policies document therefore remains consistent with both the national and regional policies, and there is no need therefore for these to be revisited at this early stage in the Plan’s implementation. 1.1.10 Further, the intention behind having a suite of local plan documents, rather than just one plan, was to enable each to be reviewed independently and updated as necessary either in whole or in part to keep them up to date. 1.1.11 In the context of the updates required, in this instance the Council has determined that a partial review is appropriate. The Council is also content that, while Haringey’s strategic housing target has been significantly increased, such growth can be accommodated in accordance with the current spatial strategy for the Borough and that this remains the most appropriate strategy when compared with the reasonable alternatives. Other Local Plan Documents 1.1.12 The Local Plan Strategic Policies is the primary and strategic Development Plan Document and is at the heart of Haringey’s Local Plan (Figure 1.1). The framework is a folder of planning policy documents. These documents are divided into three types: - Development Plan Documents (DPD) - Supplementary Planning Documents (SPD) - Others such as the Statement of Community Involvement (SCI) and the Authority Monitoring Report (AMR). 1.1.13 The Local Plan guides the content of the other planning documents (including Area Action Plans and Supplementary Planning Documents). Alongside the Local Plan, the Council is also producing other Development Plan Documents: a North London Waste Plan, Area Action Plans for Wood Green, Tottenham High Road Corridor, Northumberland Park and Tottenham Hale. The work programme for the Local Plan documents is set out in a Local Development Scheme 2015 (LDS) which includes a description and timetable for the production of each document. The Local Plan will eventually replace Haringey’s Unitary Development Plan (UDP) 2006. Please see Appendix 1 for details on the saved UDP policies. 1.1.14 Haringey’s Local Plan is the key Development Plan Document. Together with the London Plan and Haringey’s ‘saved’ UDP policies, these three documents make up the statutory ‘development plan’ for Haringey. 6 *Figure 1.1:* *Haringey Local Plan* |National Planning Policy|Col2| ||| ||| |London Plan|Col2| ||| ||| |Haringey Local Plan: Strategic Policies|Col2| ||| ||| |Policies Map|Col2|Col3| |||| |||| |||| |Statement of Community Involvement||| |||| |||| |||| 1.1.15 Planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise (Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, Section 28 (6). How we have prepared the Local Plan Strategic Policies 1.1.16 The process for preparing the Council’s Local Plan is set out below: - Gathering evidence and consulting on key ‘issues and options’ (February - March 2008); - Developing the Council’s preferred approach and consulting on it alongside the sustainability appraisal (May – June 2009); - Preparing the Local Plan for ‘proposed submission’ consultation (May - June 2010); - Submission of the Local Plan to the government (‘submission’) for a public examination where the document is assessed by a Planning Inspector (March 2011); - Examination in Public (June/July 2011 & Feb 2012); - Publication of the Inspector’s Report, (December 2012); and - Adoption of the Local Plan by the Council (March 2013). Public consultation 1.1.17 The preparation of Haringey’s Local Plan involved two main stages of public involvement and consultation. Firstly, the Council gathered views on the key issues facing the borough and the options for tackling them. The Issues and Options document was agreed in December 2007 and consultation took place between February and March 2008. The results of this consultation helped to inform the development of the Preferred Options. 7 *Green Lanes* 1.1.18 Consultation on the Preferred Options took place between May and June 2009 and included a comprehensive consultation programme. The Council met with community groups, stakeholders and ran a number of public workshops and events. Articles in Haringey People (distributed to all Haringey households), use of the press, mailings and Haringey’s website were used to engage as many communities as possible. Involvement of key stakeholders, for example infrastructure providers and neighbouring boroughs, took place throughout the preparation of the Plan. The comments and input received from the consultations were taken into consideration in the drafting of the fnal Plan. For each stage of preparation there is a consultation report that gives details of the consultation carried out and summarises the comments received. Supporting evidence 1.1.19 The Local Plan is a key strategic document for Haringey and will have a major effect on the future development of the borough. Therefore, it needs to be based on a thorough understanding of the issues and challenges the borough faces and its policies need to be supported by robust evidence. The Council commissioned and collected a wide range of studies and information to inform the preparation of the Local Plan (also known as ‘the evidence base’). This includes, but is not limited to, the following: - A Sustainability Appraisal; - Haringey Authority Monitoring Report; - Haringey Retail Capacity Study, 2008; - Haringey Housing Needs Assessment, 2007; - Affordable Housing Viability Study, 2010; - Climate change and capacity assessment for sustainable energy demand and supply in new buildings in Haringey (2009); - North London Strategic Flood Risk Assessment, 2008; - Haringey Borough Profile (2009); - Haringey Biodiversity Action Plan, 2009; - Haringey Employment Study, 2009 (with updates 2015); - Strategic Housing Market Assessment, 2014; - Development Appraisals and Viability Testing, 2014; - Open Space And Biodiversity Study 2014 - Census information (2011); - Haringey Infrastructure Delivery Plan, 2009 (with updates 2015) Haringey’s Sustainable Community Strategy and other strategies 1.1.20 The Local Plan needs to take into account other plans and strategies that influence the borough. The Plan is aligned with the priorities identifed in the Council’s Sustainable Community Strategy. Please see section 1.5 on Vision and Objectives for more information. 1.1.21 Other strategies relevant to the Local Plan include: - Haringey’s Housing Strategy (2016); - The Local Implementation Plan (LIP) (May 2011); - Haringey’s Regeneration Strategy (January 2008); - Haringey’s Children and Young People’s Plan 2009 - 2020; - Child Poverty Strategy 2008-11; - Haringey’s Greenest Borough Strategy (July 2008); - Safer for all Strategy 2008 – 2011; - Experience Still Counts: Haringey’s strategy for improving the quality of life of older people 2009-12; and - Well-being Strategic Framework (2007). 8 National Planning Policy and the London Plan 1.1.22 The Council’s Local Plan documents must be consistent with national policy prepared by the government as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), unless there is strong evidence that an alternative approach is more appropriate in Haringey. The Council’s planning documents must also be in general conformity with the Mayor of London’s London Plan (2011). The London Plan sets a social, economic and environmental framework for the future development of the capital, providing the London-wide context for borough planning policies. Sustainability Appraisal and other assessments 1.1.23 The preparation work for the Local Plan included a Sustainability Appraisal to assess its environmental, social and economic impacts. This has helped to make sure the Council’s strategy and policies are sustainable by identifying any potential harmful impacts and suggesting ways to minimise them. It also helped to identify how to maximise beneficial impacts. *High Road, Tottenham* 1.1.24 The Council carried out a Sustainability Appraisal and consulted on it at each of the stages in the production of the Plan - Issues & Options, Preferred Options and Proposed Submission. The Sustainability Appraisal is published alongside this Local Plan. 1.1.25 In addition, the Council carried out an Equalities Impact Assessment. This assessed the likely impact of the Local Plan and its policies on specific groups in terms of race, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation and religion/beliefs. The Council also carried out an assessment as to whether the Local Plan’s emerging approach and policies were likely to have any significant effect on sites of European Importance for Habitats or Species, or an adverse impact on the integrity of those sites. The screening assessment found that no significant effects were likely and therefore it was not necessary to carry out Task 2 (Appropriate Assessment) and Task 3 (Mitigation and Alternative solutions) of the Habitats Regulations Appropriate Assessment process. 9 1.2.1 Haringey is one of 32 London boroughs (Figure 1.2). It was formed from the merger of the municipal boroughs of Hornsey, Wood Green and Tottenham. The borough, which is 30 square kilometres in size, sits in north London. Some of the more familiar local landmarks include Alexandra Palace, Bruce Castle, and Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. *Figure 1.2:* *Haringey in the London Context* 1.2.2 Haringey is strategically located in the London-Stansted-Cambridge-Peterborough growth area (Figure 1.3). With strong links to the City, West End and Stansted Airport the borough is very well placed for both business and commuting. By 2016 it is estimated that approximately 350,000 new London jobs will have been created within one hour commuting time of Haringey. These include the new job opportunities created at Stratford City and the Olympic 2012 site, accessible by rail in 15 minutes from Tottenham Hale although currently there is only one train per hour, which limits the accessibility of Tottenham Hale to this part of east London. 10 1.2.3 Haringey’s strategic “hub” position is shown below. North London lies between the growth areas of: 1.2.4 Central London, which is the focus of London’s expanding world city role. It will continue to offer employment for many workers living in north London, to be a major source of demand for goods and services from north London and also to be a source of growth in the form of activities that need to be close to Central London, but are unwilling or unable to pay the associated costs of being located there. 1.2.5 The London-Stansted-CambridgePeterborough (LSCP) growth area, of which the eastern section of North London forms part. The Stansted/M11corridor alone is planned to have 40,000 new jobs and will be a potential source of new employment for north London workers. The East of England Regional Spatial Strategy (2008) envisages substantial growth in the corridor beyond the London boundary, especially around Harlow, driven by the expansion of Stansted airport. *Figure 1.3:* *North London Growth Corridor* 1.2.6 The Thames Gateway is the largest regeneration area in the UK and is expected to create around 200,000 jobs up to 2016. The western end of the Gateway abuts the eastern end of north London. It includes Stratford, just beyond the sub-regional boundary, with its High Speed One Channel Tunnel rail link and will generate 30,000 jobs up to 2016. 1.2.7 The Western Wedge stretching from Paddington to the Thames Valley and abutting the west of north London at Brent Cross. Although this is not a formal growth area, it has been one of the most dynamic development areas in the UK, buttressed by the expansion of Heathrow. The impetus of this growth will continue to a significant extent, even though the strategic priority area is now East London. 1.2.8 The M1 and A1 corridors are also not formal growth areas, but they underpin north London’s strategic role as the corridor between London and many parts of the UK. They link north London to Luton Airport, the growth area around Milton Keynes/South Midlands and expanding towns like Watford and Stevenage. 11 1.2.9 Haringey is part of north London. The Council, along with the boroughs of Barnet, Enfield, Waltham Forest and public, private and voluntary organisations work together as part of the North London Strategic Alliance (NLSA). The NLSA seeks to raise the profile of North London and increase public and private sector investment into the sub-region to address the following issues: - Coordinating housing growth with social and transport infrastructure; - Supporting the outer London economy, including promoting the role of town centres; - Increasing access to employment through skills development and training; and - Promoting a vision for the Upper Lee Valley. 1.2.10 The Upper Lee Valley has experienced a long period of decline due to structural decline of manufacturing in London. Several programmes have attempted to halt this trend, including substantial investment from the European Union. In addition, new opportunities such as the 2012 Olympic Games Legacy and the pressure for increased housing supply mean a new vision for the area is needed to ensure comprehensive redevelopment and regeneration and avoid the area being developed on a piecemeal, site by site basis. 1.2.11 Through the NLSA, the boroughs of Haringey, Barnet, Enfield and Waltham Forest together with the Greater London Authority have worked to develop a new vision that can guide the future of the area over a 20-30 year period. The vision seeks to: - Make better use of and access to the unique assets of the Upper Lee Valley improving biodiversity and promoting it as North London’s Waterside; - Reverse economic decline and create a strong platform for economic growth using its strategic locations as part of a world city; - Improve transport connections to the City, Central London and Stratford and enhance internal connectivity; - Promote social inclusion, environmental and economic sustainability and an improved quality of life; - Make better use of urban land enabling more housing and business; - Create an improved and sustainable housing environment and support community facilities; - Promote good urban design; and - Promote mixed use approach in the Central Leeside area making it the centre point and focus of the wider place. 1.2.12 A Water Space Strategy is being carried out by British Waterways, to assist the NLSA in the delivery of an enhanced vision for the Upper Lee Valley. 1.2.13 There are other action areas of the borough which require partnership working with neighbouring boroughs: - The Upper Lee Valley; - South Tottenham and Stamford Hill; - Bounds Green and the North Circular Road corridor; - Highgate; and - Finsbury Park and Manor House - with major regeneration projects at Finsbury Park station (in Islington) and at Woodberry Down (in Hackney). 12 1.2.14 There are also major redevelopment proposals in adjoining boroughs which will have an effect on the borough, for example Cricklewood/Brent Cross and London 2012/Stratford City. 1.2.15 Other sub-regional partnerships have been established to address housing and waste issues. A North London grouping of Barnet, Enfield, Haringey, Islington, Camden and Westminster prepared a Strategic Housing Market Assessment and the seven boroughs of Barnet, Camden, Enfield, Hackney, Haringey, Islington and Waltham Forest are working to prepare a North London Waste Plan Development Plan Document. 1.2.16 The London Plan was subject to further amendments in 2014 and updated in 2015. Amendments of particular relevance to the preparation of Haringey’s Local Plan, and to the management of development and growth within the Borough, included: - An increase in the number of homes to be delivered in London of 10,200 per annum including an increase in Haringey’s strategic housing target from 820 homes per annum to 1,502 homes per annum; - An update to London’s employment growth projections for the period 2011 - 2036 for which job numbers in Haringey are projected to rise from 73,000 to 95,000 or by 29.5%, the greatest increase of any London borough; - A commitment to consider an Opportunity Area designation for Wood Green; - Despite the above, a downgrade in the Wood Green Metropolitan Centre and Finsbury Park District Centre propositions for the development of a buoyant office market based on the London Office Policy Review 2012 but continued support for the creation of a district centre at Tottenham Hale; - An increase in the number of homes to be delivered within the Upper Lee Valley Opportunity Area, which includes a growth point at Tottenham Hale, from 9,000 homes to 20,100; and The introduction of an indicative benchmark target for the provision of specialist elderly persons housing across London, including 100 units per annum in Haringey. 1.2.17 The Mayor has also established an Outer London Commission (OLC) to make recommendations to inform the London Plan and other Mayoral strategies and plans. Those of particular relevance to the development of Haringey’s Local Plan are: - The basic structure to support rejuvenation of the outer London economy should be based on a constellation of town centres and other business locations rather than a few large growth hubs. Town centres are important not just in accommodating economic activity but as places people identify with and which serve as the focus for community life - indirectly, this in turn helps strengthen Outer London’s economic base; and - Crucial improvements to connectivity and movement within outer London. There is a strong feeling that improvement to orbital movement is especially important, coupled with realism over the scope for future large scale investment. The focus for investment should be based on a “spoke and hub” concept rather than a contiguous high speed link around the city and there is considerable potential in smaller scale improvements. 13 1.3.1 It is important that our Local Plan for the future development of the borough is based on an understanding of the characteristics that make Haringey what it is, and a knowledge of how it is likely to change. This section describes some of the features that give the borough its unique character. Haringey’s people - Haringey is home to 256,400 people living in an area of 30 square kilometres; - Nearly half of the population comes from ethnic minority backgrounds; - This diversity is reflected in the fact that almost half of all pupils in Haringey schools speak English as an additional language; - Haringey has a relatively transient population. At the time of the 2011 Census, there were 26,178 migrants in the Borough, the 13th highest proportion in London; - Haringey has a mosaic of community groups and networks. This contributes to community spirit and cohesion, mutual aid, empowerment, representation, advocacy and the desire for improvements to services, facilities and the environment. The Council’s new Area Forum and governance structure will aim to support and enhance these networks. Haringey’s places - Haringey is an outer London borough which was created in 1965 by the amalgamation of three former boroughs; Tottenham, Wood Green and Hornsey; - The borough covers an area of more than 11 square miles. Its most familiar local landmarks include Alexandra Palace, Bruce Castle and Tottenham Hotspur Football Stadium; - Haringey has many residential areas and neighbourhoods, each with their own distinctive identity and characteristics; - Haringey includes large areas of parks, recreation grounds and green open spaces, which make up more than 25% of its total area. They include both large parks and woods and smaller landscaped areas which are of significant amenity value to residents. The borough is home to four distinct ancient woods; Highgate Woods, Queen’s Wood, Coldfall Wood and Bluebell Wood. The borough also includes part of the Lee Valley Regional Park, which is Green Belt, areas of Metropolitan Open Land, including Alexandra Park and Ecologically Valuable Sites. The borough has three rivers; the River Lee, New River and the Moselle Brook; - Haringey has a range of centres providing shopping and services and local employment. These include Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre, Tottenham High Road Historic Corridor and specialist centres like Crouch End and Muswell Hill. 14 *Tottenham High Road* Haringey’s economy - The borough retains concentrations of designated employment in industry, offices and warehousing; - The borough contains 133 hectares of employment land, over 1,000 buildings, 722 business establishments and nearly 736,000m [2] of employment floorspace; - The borough also contains other smaller employment locations which total a further 16.6 hectares of employment land; - Haringey’s economy is dominated by small businesses. 90% of the businesses employ 10 or less people; - The major sectors of employment in Haringey are public administration, education and health (28%) and distribution, hotels and restaurants (including retail) (26%). Manufacturing and construction account for 12% of all employment. Haringey’s homes - 30% of Haringey’s population live in the 10% most deprived areas in the country. The vast bulk of this population live in the central and eastern parts of the borough; - There is a high demand for housing across all tenures; - The need for affordable housing outstrips supply, with a shortfall in provision of 11,757 homes over the plan period. As a proportion of the total net housing requirement for all tenures (20,172), this equates to 59%. At an annual rate, this is 784 affordable homes out of 1,345; - Housing need disproportionately affects BME households, and 40% of Black African and Asian households are living in unsuitable accommodation. Haringey’s environment - A network of parks, open space, wildlife sites and Green Belt is one of Haringey’s strengths, making an important contribution to the quality of life. Despite this, parts of Haringey are deficient in different types of open space provision; - There are strong water links i.e. the River Lee Navigation both with its strong heritage and cultural associations and connections to both the Thames and the Docklands; - The amount of waste being recycled in Haringey has increased by more than 100 tonnes per week following new changes to the Council’s recycling services. Haringey’s transport - Haringey has relatively good public transport; - Some parts of the borough have good tube and rail links to central London and to Heathrow and Stansted Airports; - There is a good network of cycle routes across the borough including cycle lanes on main roads, separated cycle lanes and special fully signed quiet routes; - The borough has the third highest percentage (54%) of residents who travel to work by public transport. Haringey at a glance 1.3.2 Haringey contains 19 wards which are grouped into seven Area Forums. These Area Forums provide local residents with the opportunity to contribute to the enhancement and improvement of their neighbourhoods. The overall vision of the Forums is to create a borough where the gap between the east and west is removed, with local involvement in the planning, reshaping and delivery of local services. 1.3.3 The Local Plan aims to respond to local need by linking the strategic policies with all the Council’s Plans and strategies. A snapshot of each Area Forum/Neighbourhood is provided below highlighting the key information as well as potential opportunities for the area over the plan period. 15 16 *Figure 1.4:* *Tottenham and Seven Sisters Neighbourhood* Tottenham and Seven Sisters 1717 18 *Figure 1.5:* *Crouch End* Crouch End 1919 20 *Figure 1.6:* *West Green and Bruce Grove Neighbourhood* Bruce Grove 2121 22 *Figure 1.7:* *White Hart Lane and Northumberland Park Neighbourhood* White Hart Lane and Northumberland Park 2323 24 *Figure 1.8:* *Wood Green Neighbourhood* Wood Green 2525 26 *Figure 1.9:* *St Ann’s and Harringay Neighbourhood* St �nn�s and Harringay 2727 28 *Figure 1.10:* *Muswell Hill Area Neighbourhood* Muswell Hill 2929 1.4.1 In developing a strategy to guide change and development up to 2026, there are a number of social, environmental and economic challenges to which the Council needs to respond. These challenges are cross cutting issues which shape Haringey’s Local Plan Strategic Policies. The key challenges are as follows: - Population change; - Housing; - Worklessness; - Health inequalities; - Climate change; - High quality design; - Equality and inclusion; - Transport; and - Crime and safety. Population change 1.4.2 The number of people in Haringey is increasing and the make up of the population is changing (for example, households are getting smaller and people are living longer). In 2011, the population of Haringey was approximately 256,400, making Haringey the 17th most populated borough in London. By 2026, it is anticipated that the population will have increased to over 293,700, an increase of nearly 15%. This increase, and the levels of transience it represents, presents challenges, as well as enormous opportunities for Haringey (Figure 1.11). 1.4.3 Haringey is in the top bracket for population turnover at an average of 261,400 from 2001 -­ 2007. Of this number, 49,900 moved within the borough. This level of turnover puts Haringey on a par with Camden, Islington, City of London, Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Hammersmith and Fulham, Wandsworth, and Lambeth, all of which are inner city boroughs. 1.4.4 Haringey is an exceptionally diverse and fast changing borough. 50% of the population overall and three-quarters of young people, are from ethnic minority backgrounds and over 190 languages are spoken in the borough. 30 31 *South Tottenham* 1.4.5 The ethnic profile is constantly changing and becoming more and more diverse. By 2023 the ‘white’ population is estimated to make up 63.9% of the population compared to 64.7% in 2008. ‘White’ includes the established Greek and Turkish populations, but also includes a growing Eastern European population, as indicated by a significant increase in the number of National Insurance registrations. In 2008/09 the total number of new National Insurance registrations was 13,270, the fourth highest in London. St Ann’s ward had the highest National Insurance registrations between 2006 and 2008 by residents whose previous address was overseas (between 2,300 and 2,960), while all wards in the west of the borough and White Hart Lane ward are in the lowest category (between 320 and 979). 1.4.6 Haringey has a young population with a high birth rate. Since mid-2007 there have been 3,100 more births than deaths. The population is set to increase over the coming years, with increases across all age groups with the exception of the 65-74 group which is set to decrease very slightly as a proportion of the total population. 1.4.7 The ethnic profile of the older age groups is likely to change most significantly with a higher proportion of Black Caribbean population (14.4%) in the over 75 group by 2023 than in 2008 (11.6%). The proportion of Black Africans in this age group is also expected to increase from 2.1% to 4.8% and it is likely that the numbers from European nations will also increase. Housing 1.4.8 It is the dynamics of the borough’s population that lie behind the change and growth in housing demand in the borough. Currently, just under half of Haringey’s households are owner-occupiers, with around 29% living in the social rented sector (18% Council stock, 11% Housing Association) and 22% in private rented accommodation. Owner occupation is greater in the west of the borough, with concentrations of social rented housing in the east of the borough, reflecting a wider social and economic polarisation. 30% of Haringey’s population live in central and eastern areas of the borough which are among the 10% most deprived in England, and it is in these areas that regeneration efforts are currently concentrated. 1.4.9 There is a high demand for housing across all tenures. In the private sector this can be seen in house prices, which rose by 94.9% over 2002-7, with the average home in Haringey costing approximately £353,800 in summer 2008, although this average masks significant variation across the borough. While prices are falling at the time of writing, the long-term trend is for house prices to increase. 1.4.10 The need for affordable housing outstrips supply, with a shortfall in provision of 11,757 homes over the period 2015 to 2031. As a proportion of the total net housing requirement for all tenures (20,172) over the same period, this equates to 59%. At an annual rate, this is 784 affordable homes out of 1,345. 1.4.11 Responding to this shortfall is a priority for the borough: 26% of residents consider affordable decent homes to be the most important thing in making somewhere a good place to live, and 17% think that it is the thing that most needs improving in the local area. Housing need is reflected in high demand for social housing. In 2007/8 1,488 households joined the Housing Register, while only 868 households secured a permanent social rented home. In November 2008 about 4,800 Haringey households were living in temporary accommodation, and the borough continues to face a huge challenge in meeting government targets to reduce these numbers. 32 Worklessness/Promoting a successful economy 1.4.12 A net growth of 861,000 jobs is forecast for London from 2011 to 2036 (London Plan Table 1.1), with the North London Sub-Region accounting for circa 6.5% of this growth. The most significant growth is expected in the business and financial sectors and people orientated services. Haringey is projected to grow by 12,000 jobs over its plan period between 2011 and 2016, and up to 22,000 jobs by 2036. 1.4.13 Haringey has a relatively large amount of industrial land. In the past, this land provided many jobs for manufacturing. But manufacturing has declined and we need to plan for new jobs to replace those being lost and to provide jobs for the increasing population. Travel to work patterns have become increasingly complex. It is accepted that many working residents in Haringey travel to work outside of the borough. 1.4.14 Promoting a successful and inclusive economy is particularly challenging given the current economic situation. The Council will take into account these circumstances and take measures to support our residents and businesses during difficult economic times. Access to facilities and services 1.4.15 The promotion of health and well-being cuts across many issues. There is an important link between how places are planned and the health of the people who live in them. Health should be considered as a key issue in the planning of developments, where the health impacts of the development are assessed and actions taken to create a healthy environment. Mixed and sustainable communities should improve access to health facilities as well as encouraging healthy lifestyles, for example by providing access to open spaces and recreational facilities, reducing noise and air pollution and designing walking routes and cycle lanes. 1.4.16 Overall there is wide variation across the borough with the east of the borough having higher death rates and lower life expectancy than the west. White Hart Lane and Northumberland Park have the lowest life expectancy for women and Tottenham Green, Northumberland Park and Bruce Grove for men. *Triangle Children’s Centre, St Ann’s* Recent data suggest that the death rates in the east have decreased more than those in the west, perhaps showing a start in the reduction of inequalities. 1.4.17 Haringey has a broad ethnic mix and the proportion of people from minority ethnic communities is set to increase, with more people from Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) communities in the older age groups. This will have implications for long term health conditions; although the overall proportion of people aged 65-74 is set to decrease, a greater proportion of older people will be from communities who are more at risk of conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension and renal failure. The proportion of people aged over 75 in the west of the borough is also forecast to increase. In addition there are high numbers of refugees and asylum seekers who are particularly vulnerable. 1.4.18 The rate and pattern of development and wider population and demographic change will impact on future health needs and on the demand for health services. 1.4.19 Fuel poverty remains a challenge for the borough. In Haringey, as might be expected, there are variations between the wards in the number of households in fuel poverty. The wards with the highest incidence are mainly in the east of the borough and include Seven Sisters, Northumberland Park and Noel Park. In the west there is less incidence with lowest being Fortis Green, Muswell Hill and Crouch End. This is not to say however, that within these wards there are no variations between individual households. 33 1.4.20 The Council and its partners seek to improve and ensure equitable access to services and facilities. It aims to address accessibility (both in terms of location and physical access) for all members of the community to jobs, health, housing, education, shops, leisure and community facilities. 1.4.21 NHS Haringey is implementing its Primary Care strategy which responds to inequalities in access to primary care and seeks to improve the level and quality of access to services. 1.4.22 Tackling wider health inequalities in Haringey is linked to deprivation and lifestyles choices. Climate change 1.4.23 It is recognised that climate change will affect all our lives and those of future generations, with global changes having local impacts. We need to respond to this by greatly reducing Haringey’s impact on the environment by planning measures to deal with the cause and effects of climate change in the borough. Our response to these issues must be sensitive to the high quality environment in much of the borough. 1.4.24 Haringey Council signed the Nottingham Declaration in December 2006, and adopted a Greenest Borough Strategy in July 2008, committing itself to significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Baseline carbon emissions data (2003) reveals that CO 2 emissions for Haringey are 49% from dwellings, 33% from non-domestic buildings and 18% from transport. The whole of the borough of Haringey is an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) for the pollutants of NO 2 (Nitrogen Dioxide) and PM10 particulates which are the most prominent air pollutants). The dominant source of NO 2 and PM10 emissions in Haringey is road transport with a variety of other sources contributing emissions. This has implications for air quality, which is being addressed through the measures outlined in the Council’s Air Quality Action Plan. 1.4.25 The need to protect and enhance the environment and the prudent use of natural resources is increasingly recognised. Future developments in the borough will be driven by the need to make better use of key resources such as land, buildings and construction materials, water, energy and waste, whilst reducing emissions that contribute towards climate change. The landfill of waste is no longer an option and we must seek to ensure that waste is reused and recycled locally. 1.4.26 Land is a finite resource and in responding to housing and population growth we must seek to reuse brownfield land and promote the more efficient use of land as an alternative to developing on green spaces. The reuse of brownfield sites, which have the potential for soil contamination, should be remediated in line with the NPPF and particular care should be taken in source protection zones for water abstraction. 1.4.27 Parts of the borough are in flood risk zones and the Council will take a strategic, riskbased approach to avoid placing inappropriate developments in areas at risk of flooding by applying the Sequential and Exemption Test. Mitigation and adaptation measures have an important role in managing the impact of future climatic changes. High quality design 1.4.28 High quality design is a key element in achieving sustainable development as it can create safe environments, make best use of a site responding to its setting and context, minimise the use of resources through sustainable design and construction and make developments accessible to everyone. 1.4.29 There are currently 16 listed buildings and two conservation areas currently identified as being at risk within the borough on English Heritage’s register of Heritage at Risk. In addition, the borough faces the challenge of accommodating growth within its historic environment without harm to its historic significance. 1.4.30 The Council will use its available powers to ensure Haringey’s section of the English Heritage ‘Heritage at Risk’ register is reduced, with the ultimate aim of having no heritage assets such as listed buildings or conservation areas on the register. 34 Equality and inclusion 1.4.31 In accordance with government legislation and policy, Haringey’s Local Plan will incorporate policies that will promote fairness, inclusion and respect for people from all sections of society, regardless of their age, gender, disability, sexual orientation, race, culture or religion. Everyone should have an equal opportunity to access the services and opportunities available within Haringey. The Local Plan, will, therefore, promote socially inclusive communities through new development by: - Ensuring that the impact of development on the social fabric of communities is considered and taken into account; - Seeking to reduce social inequalities; - Addressing accessibility (both in terms of location and physical access) for all members of the community to jobs, health, housing, education, shops, leisure and community facilities; - Encouraging a variety of services and facilities and their accessibility e.g. recycling facilities; - Providing, where possible, schools, hospitals, open space, public transport and training facilities, as well as employment and residential accommodation; and - Taking into account the needs of all the community. Transport 1.4.32 Haringey has relatively good public transport, providing its residents access to employment opportunities in the City and the West End, which are within easy travelling distance of rail and tube connections. 1.4.33 Traffic volume on Haringey roads has reduced since 2001. However, there are congestion hotspots including in town centres and on the strategic road network. There is evidence that car ownership has also stabilised in recent years. Travel patterns are becoming more complex, particularly at peak times with commuting and the “school run”. The borough is relatively well served by north-south routes, but movement east-west, particularly by public transport, is often difficult. High levels of car use and road congestion can harm local air quality, and in turn affect the health of residents. 1.4.34 The Council wants to promote travel in Haringey so that it is safe, easy, and healthy and does not harm our local environment or contribute to climate change. In response, a package of measures is required to restrict car use, promote sustainable transport options and change travel behaviour. Crime and safety 1.4.35 Crime has been steadily declining in Haringey. But some neighbourhoods and some groups remain much more likely to fall victim to crime than others – and, concern about crime, anti-­ social behaviour and fear of crime are the top concerns for people in the borough. Through Haringey’s Safer for All Strategy 2008-11 the challenge is two-fold: to tackle persistent problems, including crime ‘hotspots’, anti-­ social behaviour, drugs and domestic violence; and to address public concerns about crime, through better and more targeted communications and initiatives. 1.4.36 The Council needs to ensure that Haringey becomes a safer place while retaining the vibrancy that makes it such an interesting and popular place to live and visit. There are solutions to ‘designing out crime’ from our buildings and places. 35 1.5.1 The main body of this document sets out Haringey’s way forward on the key issues for the future, responding to the challenges the Council faces. These have been developed taking into account the following sources: - Haringey’s Sustainable Community Strategy and other Council plans and strategies; - The responses to consultation on Issues and Options Consultation February-March 2008; - The responses to consultation on the Preferred Options May - June 2009; - Evidence we have collected and commissioned; and - Other relevant plans and strategies. Local Plan Vision 1.5.2 Haringey Strategic Partnership developed Haringey’s Sustainable Community Strategy 2007 - 2016 which identifies priorities and a ten year vision for the borough. The overall vision of the Community Strategy is that Haringey will be: 1.5.3 A place for diverse communities that people are proud to belong to. The six outcomes identified in the Community Strategy to achieve its vision are set out below. Strategic Outcomes People at the Heart of Change by delivering new homes and new jobs, with supporting services and transport and utility infrastructure at the right place and the right time. An Environmentally Sustainable Future by responding to climate change and managing our environmental resources more effectively to make Haringey one of London’s greenest boroughs. Economic Vitality and Prosperity Shared by All by meeting business needs and providing local employment opportunities and promoting a vibrant economy and independent living. Safer for All by reducing both crime and fear of crime, through good design and improvements to the public realm and by creating safer, cleaner streets. Healthier People with a Better Quality of Life by providing better housing, meeting health and community needs and encouraging lifetime well-­ being at home, work, play and learning. People and Customer Focused by providing high quality, accessible services that give value for money, respond to people’s need and meet their aspirations. Put greater emphasis on community engagement and tackle social exclusion. 1.5.4 Following consultation with stakeholders and the general public on the Issues and Options Report (December 2007) and the Preferred Options (May and June 2009) and the vision from the Sustainable Community Strategy the following vision has been developed specifically for the Local Plan. It is this vision that the spatial strategy and strategic policies will deliver. 36 VISION STATEMENT FOR HARINGEY IN 2026 HARINGEY’S GROWTH The different aspects of growth have varied across different locations in the borough. Haringey Heartlands and Tottenham Hale are successful new mixed communities with high quality social and community infrastructure. Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre has continued to thrive with its mix of retail, leisure and cultural uses and has become an attractive place to live. Across the borough, neighbourhoods have benefited from preserving their historic character and improving areas where required, such as estate regeneration. Haringey has a diverse growing population and a diverse landscape, embracing the Edwardian sweep of Muswell Hill, the colourful spectacle of Green Lanes, the panoramic hill top views from Alexandra Palace and the wide vistas of Tottenham Marshes and the River Lee. The uniqueness and distinctiveness of our varied neighbourhoods captures the essence of Haringey as a place to live, work and visit. ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Growth in Haringey is now managed to support sustainable communities. Growth is environmentally sustainable in its minimisation of the borough’s contribution to climate change through location and design in the built environment, the promotion of reducing, reusing and recycling as a way of life, encouraging energy efficiency and using renewable energy, and by using and promoting sustainable travel modes and patterns. Haringey has a network of cycle lanes and secure bike parks, encouraging greater levels of cycling and walking, while also promoting the use of public and greener transport. ECONOMIC GROWTH Haringey is a socially inclusive borough that tackles poverty and disadvantage. Haringey’s economy is sustainable in terms of economic growth, and makes the most of employment opportunities. More people are engaged locally in employment, training and education. Haringey has exploited its strategic location and has increased inward investment to link people to areas of employment. The food and drink, clothing, information, communication and technology and the creative and cultural industries all form key parts of Haringey’s ‘unique selling point’ with Haringey’s diverse and entrepreneurial population creating robust markets for their goods and services. A SAFER AND HEALTHIER HARINGEY Haringey is a safe borough where people feel secure and confident and can enjoy all the wonderful spaces and places the borough has to offer. Crime and the fear of crime have reduced. Haringey has high quality buildings and public realm guided by international and national best practice. The borough’s open spaces are of high quality, accessible for all residents which are safe and secure, and provide appropriate facilities. The heritage and historic spaces, structures and buildings of Haringey are protected and maintained for existing and future generations to be proud of. Haringey has a healthy population. All residents have access to health and education facilities and social and community services, and enjoy a healthy lifestyle and improved quality of life and well-being which is measurable across the borough. CIVIC ENGAGEMENT Haringey has more opportunities for civic engagement and volunteering, drawing in local people to work together to tackle social isolation and exclusion. 37 *Haringey’s Green Spaces* Key principles 1.5.5 This spatial vision is underpinned by a number of key principles which guide and steer the Local Plan and its long term implementation: Making the best use of Haringey’s land -­ creating sustainable communities particularly at Tottenham Hale and Haringey Heartlands; - Reinforce a sense of place - building stronger communities and improving community safety by actively promoting community cohesion and working with local residents to help shape the places in which they live; - Integrate transport and land use - creating a comprehensive public transport network that is accessible and safe for all and encourages residents to choose more sustainable modes of transport including public transport, walking and cycling; - Work in partnership; - Conserve and reuse resources - lessening our impact on the environment and preparing for climate change, developing the Council’s sustainable design and construction policies, planning with other north London boroughs to provide sufficient land in the sub region to deal with waste; - Diversify and grow the economy - supporting business and job growth, addressing the borough’s worklessness by increasing the skills and employability of local people, encouraging enterprise and inward investment, protecting employment land, strengthening Haringey’s town centres and planning for retail growth; *Hornsey High Street* - Good design from the outset - protecting and enhancing the borough’s distinctive characteristics, the historic environments contribution to an area’s sense of place and establishing unique neighbourhoods and improving the quality and appearance of Haringey’s public spaces and street scene; - Access to open space - protecting, enhancing and improving access to Haringey’s green and open areas, particularly in areas deficient in open space in the east of the borough; Support health and community well being -­ reducing inequalities in health and wellbeing, and - Support community cohesion and civic engagement - providing high quality, accessible services that give value for money, respond to people’s need and meet their aspirations. Strategic Objectives 1.5.6 The Council has developed a series of strategic objectives that take forward the Sustainable Community Strategy’s strategic outcomes identified above and set out the basis for the Local Plan and its key policies. These objectives give direction for the spatial strategy set out in paragraph 2.1 and are developed further in the core policies which follow in section 3 of this document. 38 39 |PEOPLE AT THE HEART OF CHANGE|Col2| ||| |Objectives|Local Plan Strategic Policy (SP)| |To manage growth at Haringey Heartlands and Tottenham Hale so that it meets our needs for homes, jobs and services, is supported by necessary infrastructure and maximises the benefits for the local area and community and the borough as a whole.|1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.| |To provide homes to meet Haringey’s housing needs and strategic housing requirement of a minimum 19,800 net new homes over the plan period to 2026, in terms of affordability, quality and diversity and to help create mixed communities.|1, 2, 3, 11.| |To promote the effcient and effective use of land whilst minimising environmental impacts.|1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7.| |To strengthen the role of Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre and the borough’s district centres as accessible locations for retail, offce, leisure and community uses and new homes.|1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16.| |AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE FUTURE|| |Objectives|Local Plan Strategic Policy (SP)| |To limit climate change by reducing CO emissions in Haringey. 2|4, 7| |To adapt to climate change by improving the sustainability of buildings against flood risk, water stress and overheating.|4, 5, 6| |To manage air quality within the borough by travel planning, promotion of walking, cycling and public transport.

The Council has grouped the issues covered into six sections reflecting the priorities of its Sustainable Community Strategy: Section 3 People at the Heart of Change in Haringey Section 4 An Environmentally Sustainable Future Section 5 Economic Vitality and Prosperity Shared by All Section 6 A Safer, Attractive and Valued Urban Environment Section 7 Healthier People with a Better Quality of Life Section 8 Delivering and Monitoring 1.6.2 Section 3 sets the Council’s overall approach to the distribution of future growth in the borough and its management. It also includes our approach to housing and the type of housing needed to support Haringey’s growing population. Section 4 contains the Council’s approach to sustainable development and how it intends to make Haringey the greenest borough. Section 5 looks at ways in which Haringey will provide jobs and services and improve its town centres. Sections 6 and 7 explain how the Council intends to improve its built environment and make sure the quality of life in Haringey is maintained and enhanced. Finally Section 8 sets out how the Local Plan will be implemented through providing necessary infrastructure and working with partners and stakeholders. It also outlines how the Council will monitor the effectiveness of the Plan in delivering its objectives. 1.6.3 All the policies within this plan are interrelated and should not be viewed in isolation. To enable greater ease of use, there is cross referencing to other directly related policies. However, these policies should not be used as the sole means for comprehensively assessing which policies apply to a development proposal. Development proposals will be assessed on how well they meet all relevant policies within the Local Plan together with other relevant policies in the development management plan for Haringey. Appendix 1 sets out the extant policies of the 2006 UDP that will still apply when determining planning applications until they are completely replaced by the Development Management Policies. 1.6.4 Local Plan policies do not repeat national or London Plan policies, but do refer to specific national and regional targets. The Local Plan should be read alongside the London Plan. 40",

The Key Diagram (Figure 2.1) identifies the Key Areas for the borough for which there are specific spatial policies for managing growth and change in the plan period. The Council’s overall strategy for managing future growth in Haringey is to promote the provision of homes, jobs and other facilities in the areas with significant redevelopment opportunities at, or near, transportation hubs, and support appropriate development at other accessible locations, with more limited change elsewhere. This approach will: - Focus growth on places that can support higher density development, reducing pressure for residential development in predominantly residential areas (although some development will take place throughout the borough); - Allow us to better shape places by promoting high quality design of buildings and places, securing necessary infrastructure, providing an appropriate mix of uses, including community facilities and securing regeneration benefits; and - Through promoting larger schemes, increase our ability to provide more sustainable places, for example, by maximising opportunities for local power and heating systems. 2.1.2 The borough has a capacity to deliver approximately 24,000 homes between 2011 and 2026, as set out in the Housing Trajectory (see Appendix 2). 2.1.3 The parts of Haringey not covered by the Key Areas on the Key Diagram will also have development over the next 15 years. However, the Council envisages such development is likely to be of an incremental nature as smaller housing sites come forward for redevelopment and will be assessed in accordance with this Local Plan and other planning policies. Figure 3.7 shows the housing sites expected to come forward over the plan period. Haringey’s Growth Areas 2.1.4 Development in the growth areas should take account of the community, environmental and other distinctive local characteristics of each area, deliver good design, including public realm, open space and promote social and economic inclusion and relate development to the surrounding areas. Tall buildings may be appropriate at certain locations within these areas (see SP11 Design for the Council’s approach to tall buildings), subject to further detailed analysis. Haringey Heartlands and Tottenham Hale will be the key locations for the largest amount of Haringey’s future growth. Their signifcance lies in their location within the London-Stansted-Cambridge-Peterborough Growth Corridor and they are also identifed in the London Plan as an Area for Intensifcation and an Opportunity Area respectively. These areas are suitable for large scale redevelopment with signifcant increases in jobs and homes. 2.1.5 Regeneration of the wider Northumberland Park area (which includes the redevelopment of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club) and Seven Sisters Corridor will also provide a substantial number of jobs and new homes, as well as other community uses and facilities and estate regeneration. The Council’s overall approach to growth in these areas is set out in SP1 Managing Growth. 42 43 *Wood Green* 2.1.6 Beyond the growth areas there are a number Making the best use of land in of other parts of the borough which are Haringey considered suitable locations for significant 2.1.7 In order to accommodate Haringey’s growing development as they are highly accessible by population, the Council needs to make the a range of means of transport. best use of the borough’s limited land and resources. The Council will promote the most efficient use of land in Haringey and buildings while also seeking to improve the quality of our environment protect the amenity of occupiers and neighbours and meet other planning objectives. 44 Density 2.1.8 One way of making the most efficient use of our land and buildings is to encourage higher densities. The Council will encourage high densities in the most accessible parts of the borough (generally Tottenham Hale, Haringey Heartlands and Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre) as well as other appropriate locations. New schemes should be of high quality design and sensitively consider the character and built form of their surroundings, particularly in Conservation Areas. Good design can increase density while protecting and enhancing the character of an area (please see SP 11 Design for more detail on our approach to design). The Council will expect the density of housing development to comply with the Density Matrix in the London Plan (Table 3.2). Density will vary across the borough due to its different character settings; however, densities below the relevant range in the density matrix will not be permitted. Please see SP2 Housing for more details on the Council’s approach to housing. *Hornsey* Mixed use developments 2.1.9 The provision of an appropriate mix of uses, both within areas and in individual buildings, can also contribute to successfully managing future growth in Haringey and making efficient use of land. A mix of uses can also: - Reduce commuting and the need for some other journeys, helping to cut congestion in the borough and improve air quality; - Increase the provision of much needed housing; and - Promote successful places that have a range of activities, increasing safety and security. 2.1.10 The Council will require the provision of a mix of uses in suitable locations and expect development proposals of an appropriate size in Haringey Heartlands, Tottenham Hale, Northumberland Park (Tottenham Hotspur Stadium Development) and Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre to contribute towards the supply of housing, the provision of jobs and community facilities. 45 2.2.1 In line with the National Planning Policy Framework, the Local Plan follows the approach of the presumption in favour of sustainable development. SP0: PRESUMPTION IN FAVOUR OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT When considering development proposals the Council will take a positive approach that reflects the presumption in favour of sustainable development contained in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). The Council will always work proactively with applicants to find solutions, which mean that proposals can be approved wherever possible and to secure development that improves the economic social and environmental conditions in Haringey. Planning applications that accord with the policies in Haringey’s Local Plan (and, where relevant, with policies in neighbourhood plans) will be approved without delay, unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Where there are no policies relevant to the application or relevant policies are out of date at the time of making the decision, then the Council will grant permission unless material considerations indicate otherwise taking into account whether: - Any adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies of the NPPF taken as a whole; or - Specific policies in the NPPF indicate that development should be restricted. 46",

      "content": "3.1 SP1 Managing Growth 3.2 SP2 Housing 3.3 SP3 Gypsies and Travellers 47 3.1.1 People at the Heart of Change is the key objective of the Sustainable Community Strategy. Haringey is one of the most diverse areas in the country and this presents many challenges in terms of its location, high levels of deprivation and hugely successful local business entrepreneurship. 3.1.2 In common with the rest of London, Haringey is expected to experience rapid growth in its population, with a projected 15% population increase to 293,749 by 2026. This growth will bring with it pressure for new housing and associated infrastructure. Strategic Policy 1 sets out the overarching approach to the location of future growth and development in the borough. SP1: MANAGING GROWTH The Council will focus Haringey’s growth in the most suitable locations, and manage it to make sure that the Council delivers the opportunities and benefits and achieve strong, healthy and sustainable communities for the whole of the Borough. The Council will maximise the supply of additional housing to meet and exceed its minimum strategic housing requirement of 19,802 homes over the plan period from 2011-2026. The Council will promote development in the following Growth Areas: - Wood Green; - Tottenham Hale; and - North Tottenham (which includes Northumberland Park, the redevelopment of Tottenham Hotspur Football Stadium, and High Road West). The Council will expect development in the Growth Areas to: - Provide approximately 20,410 new homes and the majority of new business floorspace up to 2026; - Maximise site opportunities; - Provide appropriate links to, and benefits for, surrounding areas and communities; - Provide the necessary infrastructure; and - Be in accordance with the full range of the Council’s planning policies and objectives. The Council will promote development in the following Areas of Change: - Tottenham High Road Corridor; and - Seven Sisters Corridor. - Parts of the Borough outside of the Growth Areas and Areas of Change will experience some development and change in contributing towards meeting local development needs. The Council will ensure that development in these Areas of Limited Change will respect the character of its surroundings and provide environmental improvements and services. 48 Accommodating Haringey’s Growth 3.1.5 The Council will expect development in the 3.1.3 The Local Plan will direct development to the most appropriate locations, so that housing growth is supported by sufficient jobs and key infrastructure including community facilities such as health, education and sports facilities. As the objectives in Section 1 set out, the Council wishes to manage growth over the life of the Plan so that it meets the need for homes, jobs and services, is supported by necessary infrastructure and maximises the benefits for the local area and community and the borough as a whole. This policy is also supported by the sustainability appraisal. 3.1.4 In common with the rest of London, Haringey is expected to experience rapid growth in population. This growth will bring with it pressure for new housing and associated infrastructure. Each of Haringey’s growth areas has been identified in the London Plan as having potential for significant increases in jobs and homes. growth areas to maximise site opportunities and the opportunities and benefits for the borough and the local area within the context of the full range of Haringey’s planning policies and objectives, including those relating to amenity, sustainability, heritage/ built environment, open space, community safety and sustainable transport. Development should also take account of natural constraints, particularly the risk of flooding. It is important to note that the growth areas also include existing residential communities and heritage assets such as Conservation Areas and areas of Industrial Heritage. New development must take account of its sensitive context. 3.1.6 The social and physical infrastructure required to support the development and growth planned for through the Haringey Local Plan is set out in the Council’s Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP). The IDP is intended to be a ‘live’ document that will be subject to regular updating to take account of changes to funding streams, service plans or delivery programmes, and will be used by the Council to inform its own capital programme, ongoing discussions with service providers, and to support funding bids. 3.1.7 Haringey’s Growth Areas – these are areas with the greatest capacity for growth. It is expected that the most significant amount of houses, jobs and infrastructure will be delivered in these areas over the plan period. 3.1.8 Areas of Change – these are areas with considerable potential for growth, though on a lesser scale than growth areas. These areas are appropriately located to support growth and contain identified sites which are available and suitable for development. 3.1.9 Areas of Limited Change – these are areas in which expected growth is likely to make only a modest but still important contribution towards the overall local development needs of the Borough through opportunities on identified previously developed land, and small scale infill and conversions. Development within these areas is likely to be more constrained by the local context and the capacity of existing local infrastructure and services and be of an incremental nature. 49 3.1.10 The Site Allocations DPD and the Tottenham Area Action Plan give effect to the spatial strategy by identifying and allocating development sites with capacity to accommodate 8,560 and 11,850 net new homes respectively. Along with small sites (i.e. developments of less than 10 units) contributing circa 3,593 homes, this provides a boroughwide capacity of circa 24,000 net new homes from 2011 to 2026. The following housing figures are indicative by plan and, therein, by broad areas over the plan period. |Table 3.1: Broad dis|Col2|stribution of new housing|Col4|Col5|Col6| ||||||| |Development Plan Document||Location & minimum total number of dwellings|0-5 years (2011/12 -2015/16)|6-10 years (2016/17-20/21)|11-15 years (2021/22-2025/26)| |Site Allocations||Wood Green 4,610 units|185|920|3,505| |||Areas of Limited Change 5,940 units|1,285|2,825|1,830| ||Tottenham Area Action Plan|Seven Sisters Corridor (south) 2,020 units|25|1,200|795| |||Tottenham Hale 5,665 units|2,230|1,975|1,460| |||North Tottenham 4,695 units|275|920|3,550| |||Tottenham High Road Corridor Bruce Grove 1,080 units|570|380|130| |Totals||24,010|4,570|8,220|11,220| 51 *Albermarle Court, Hale Village* *(photograph: Newlon Housing Trust)* 3.1.11 The following section sets out the Council’s expectations on the scale of development in the areas mentioned above. Growth Areas Wood Green 3.1.12 The London Plan designates Wood Green as an Area of Intensification (Figure 3.1) with proposals for the creation of approximately 2,000 new jobs and 1,000 new homes as part of an intensive mixed use redevelopment 3.1.13 Wood Green Development Framework was produced in 2005 and sets out the Council’s overall vision for the area including promoting and expanding the Wood Green Cultural Quarter, providing new homes and jobs, and high quality open space. 3.1.14 Wood Green provides a range of development opportunities on the railway and industrial lands to the south-west of Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre. These sites include Clarendon Road gas works (with the central area occupied by two gasholders, which are still operational), the adjacent Coburg Road Industrial Area and Hornsey Waterworks and the former Hornsey Central Depot. There is significant scope for the enhancement of these areas, while respecting their industrial heritage and the provision of better links to Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre, in order to secure its position as an urban centre for the 21st Century. ASPIRATIONS The Council’s aspiration for Haringey Heartlands includes: - To increase capacity and variety of uses at Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre, given its proximity to Haringey Heartlands and the thriving Cultural Quarter; - To bring back into use underused brownfield land and maximise capacity for housing and employment growth; - The provision of additional open space, play areas, and community facilities as required by development of the area in order to meet the needs of the resident population; - Physical and visual integration of the Heartlands with the wider area to benefit local communities and ensure sustainable development that will meet local and strategic goals; - De-commissioning of the gas holders and decontamination of the land in order to bring forward development; - Preparation of a business relocation strategy to provide impetus for land assembly; - Improvement of pedestrian linkages to Wood Green and Haringey Heartlands; and - Provision of green infrastructure projects to address a range of environmental issues. For the Eastern Utility Lands, the Council will require the following: - A mix of uses including substantial new housing, restaurant/cafe/drinking establishment uses and community/leisure uses; - A mix of office use, retail/financial and professional services; - An excellent public realm with a network of safe and attractive places both public and private; - An energy centre and utility compounds; - Car parking spaces, cycle parking; - Access and other associated infrastructure works; and - To maintain and enhance the operational railway and safeguard for any necessary railway improvement works. 52 Tottenham Hale 3.1.15 The London Plan designates Tottenham Hale as an Opportunity Area. Tottenham Hale is situated on the eastern side of the borough and sits within the Upper Lee Valley (Figure 3.2). It is predominantly industrial in nature, comprising retail warehouses, industrial estates, a major gyratory road system and public transport interchange, which add to its image as an unwelcoming and traffic dominated environment. Relatively few people live within this area, which has suffered from the continued decline in manufacturing and remains characterised by deprivation, a poor physical environment, underused and vacant sites, and divisive transport corridors. Currently, the area fails to capitalise on its many advantages and exciting new vision for its transformation as a bustling new urban centre. This includes its exceptional natural environmental assets, such as its close proximity to Lee Valley Regional Park and its waterside location next to the River Lee Navigation offering significant environmental and recreational benefits. 3.1.16 The sites within the Tottenham Hale Growth Area have undergone the Sequential Test (and where necessary the Exception Test) in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). This has ensured that there are no alternative sites of lower flood risk where the development can be located (see the Sequential Test report for Tottenham Hale). 53 ASPIRATIONS The Council’s aspirations for the area include: - Integration of new and existing communities. Clear and explicit links must be made between new opportunities in Tottenham and the existing community, to ensure regeneration benefits include local people; - Returning the gyratory to two-way traffic. Currently the gyratory is part of the local one-way system, distributing traffic from Tottenham High Road towards Tottenham Hale. It carries a heavy volume of fast-flowing traffic which creates a dangerous environment for pedestrians and cyclists. Its future will be a crucial factor in the transformation of the area; - The provision of additional open space, play areas and community facilities as required by development of the area in order to meet the needs of the resident population; - Introducing measures to reduce flood risk such as the de-culverting of the Moselle Brook, application of sustainable urban drainage systems, and support for the introduction of measures to reduce water consumption to improve water efficiency; - The creation of a new facility for Front Line Services including recycling at Marsh Lane which will promote green industries in the area; and - A new high quality station square and a state of the art new public transport interchange at Tottenham Hale. 3.1.17 A Tottenham Hale Urban Centre Masterplan Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) was adopted in October 2006 to guide the redevelopment of key sites within the Tottenham Hale Urban Centre. Four key areas make up the Urban Centre area. Taken together they represent a major opportunity to create a thriving, sustainable urban centre, providing more than 5,000 new homes and 4,000 jobs, which maximise the area’s exceptional geographical advantages. New jobs will be delivered through the reconfiguration of a number of the existing employment sites away from industrial & warehousing uses to mixed use providing more intensive employment / business uses, through further growth in the retail and leisure provision, and through increased community facilities. Development will take place in the following areas:. Development will take place in the following areas: Greater Ashley Road 3.1.18 The next phase in the regeneration of Tottenham Hale will focus on the area around Ashley Road and Tottenham Hale Station. The Council aims to create a highquality, unique place with new homes, office, commercial and retail space, as well as new or replacement community facilities, improved open space, improved public transport facilities and improved pedestrian and cycle links. Improvements to open space, pedestrian and cycle access will complement and link into the Regional Park and existing routes and seek to enhance the extent of green infrastructure within the area. Hale Waterside (Hale Wharf) 3.1.19 A mini-masterplan is being devised to underpin a comprehensive, residential-led development for the entire Hale Waterside site, which could provide a significant number of new homes as well as commercial uses. This plan will take account of the Regional Park Authority’s objectives, as Hale Wharf is within the Lee Valley Regional Park. A proposed pedestrian footbridge across the River Lee will form an integral part of the scheme, and one element of the east-west pedestrian ‘green link’. 54 Tottenham Gyratory Road System, Bus Station and Public Square 3.1.20 Transport for London (TfL) has worked with the Council to return the one-way road system to two-way working, and to provide a new bus station in front of Tottenham Hale Station. These and further planned improvements, including the creation of a new public square at the Station, will improve access into the Lee Valley Regional Park at Tottenham Marshes, linking together this significant open recreational space with wider green infrastructure within the locality. The one-way system carried high volumes of traffic, with few pedestrian crossings, creating a substantial barrier to movement for those living within the one-way system. The £37m Tottenham Hale transport improvement scheme has sought to reduce the impact of traffic on the local area, and increase capacity to cope with future demand. This will enable the regeneration of the area as set out in the Tottenham Area Action Plan, and directly facilitate a significant residential-led development on the existing island site. There are planned improvements to the Tottenham Hale Station as a strategic interchange. The £32m project includes improving access within the station for easy flow between train, tube and buses, and improving accessibility for all. TfL and Network Rail have also committed to increasing the track numbers to four for sections of the West Anglia line. This will require an additional platform at Tottenham Hale station and potentially at other stations on the line. (Further proposals for future infrastructure improvements are set out in the Council’s Infrastructure Delivery Plan). Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre 3.1.21 Wood Green is a vibrant and busy town centre, which has an important role to play within the London and north London sub-regional town centre hierarchy. It is designated as a Metropolitan Centre in the London Plan, one of only 12 identified in London, which reflects its role as a key retail and commercial destination in North London (Figure 3.3). 3.1.22 The town centre is predominantly linear stretching along the High Road from the junction with Turnpike Lane in the south to the junction with Bounds Green Road in the north. It includes The Mall Wood Green (formerly known as Shopping City) which straddles the High Road and provides a focus for the major multiple retailers located in the centre. The main supermarkets within Wood Green are evenly spread throughout the centre, with the large Morrison’s and Sainsbury’s supermarkets both located centrally. In addition, Marks and Spencer’s Food Hall is located in the southern part of the centre and an Iceland is located on Brook Road. There is also a Tesco Express at the southern end. 55 3.1.23 Shopping is the dominant activity in the town centre. There are relatively few restaurants, cafés, pubs and bars in comparison and, limited office space provision, with the exception of the Council’s own offices. However, there is considerable residential development with flats located above The Mall and Bury Road Car Parks. In terms of other town centre attractions Wood Green boasts two large multi-screen cinemas, a library and a health club. The Wood Green Area of Change and Town Centre borders and includes parts of Noel Park, Trinity Gardens, Wood Green Common and Bowes Park Conservation Areas, and immediately to the west, the centre is predominantly bounded by residential areas, two conservation areas located nearby (Trinity Gardens and Noel Park) and immediately to the west, Haringey Heartlands Growth Area. 3.1.24 The town centre boundary was tightly drawn in the UDP (2006). However, in planning for the future intensification of the town centre, opportunity sites will be considered that lie beyond the town centre boundary. They will be considered on the basis of their relationship with, and impact on, the town centre in terms of land uses, pedestrian and public transport linkages, regeneration benefits arising from redevelopment at either the Heartlands Growth Area or through windfall opportunities. Further detail will be included in a Wood Green Area Action Plan. The North Tottenham Growth Area ASPIRATIONS The Council’s aspirations for Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre are: - To improve linkages with Haringey Heartlands to the west of the town centre and enhance accessibility into and around the town centre for all members of the community; - To encourage the retention and enhancement of the distinctive character areas within the town centre; - To reduce congestion in the town centre by promoting car free development and the use of sustainable means of transportation; - To conserve and restore high quality buildings within the town centre, and encourage appropriate development which respects the local environment and is of the highest standard of sustainable design; - To develop the range and quality of the retail offered within the town centre; - To improve the quantity, value and usage of town centre open spaces; - To increase safety within the town centre, improving the confidence of visitors and users, and facilitating the development of a more positive overall perception of Wood Green as a destination; - To encourage the development and management of appropriate leisure and night-time economy uses in the town centre and develop town centre infrastructure and amenities; and - To increase the range and quantity of employment opportunities within the town centre. Northumberland Park 3.1.25 Northumberland Park (Figure 3.4) is characterised as being one of the most severely deprived areas not only in Haringey but the whole country. Results from the Indices of Deprivation 2004 found that 85% of residents in the Northumberland Park ward live in areas that are amongst the 10% most deprived in England. Much of this deprivation stems from labour market disadvantage i.e. worklessness and low skills base. 3.1.26 Approximately 13,183 people live in Northumberland Park. According to the 2001 census 71.1% of the population of Northumberland Park is from a BME background compared with 54.7% in Haringey as a whole. - To promote a sustainable future for Wood Green Town Centre; 3.1.27 The urban form of the area is very fragmented - To improve the public realm throughout the with an incoherent street pattern. Smaller town centre and to create a more pleasant scaled terrace houses are next to 20 storey pedestrian environment; 1960s apartment blocks. Streets and pavements are of poor quality and do not make for a good street scene. 56 - To improve the public realm throughout the town centre and to create a more pleasant pedestrian environment; 3.1.28 Two railway lines cut through the east and western thirds of the ward. The rail line to the east is a considerable obstruction for pedestrian and vehicular traffc, and particularly when the level crossing and the barriers can be down for as long as ten minutes at a time. There tends to be more permeability with the raised line in the west. 3.1.29 There is virtually no green space in the ward and although it includes Tottenham Marshes and is adjacent to the Lee Valley Regional Park, access to these amenities are severed by the railway and Watermead Way. Bruce Castle Park and the cemetery in the west provide some open space, however connections to the park from the residential areas are very poor. The area also has a number of potentially dangerous walkways that are narrowly enclosed and not overlooked. In general however, the residential areas both east and west of the High Road are well maintained and there is little graffti or fy-tipping. There are few abandoned or derelict buildings. 3.1.30 Crime levels in the area are currently high with recorded crimes per head of population of all types being higher for Northumberland Park, and for the wider Tottenham area than for Haringey and London as a whole. 3.1.31 The high level of educational deprivation may be attributed, in part, to the qualifcations of the existing adult population. At school level, performance has been improving across some schools in close proximity to the football ground (St Francis de Sales, and Northumberland Park Community School). As of 2010, both schools have been improving faster than the national average in terms of either the % 5+A*-C (including English and Maths) or KS2, refecting signifcant improvements in recent years in Northumberland Park ward. 3.1.32 Attainment rates in the borough as a whole are improving, though they are still below the England average and over 10% of 16 to 18 year olds are not in employment, education or training (NEETs - a key Government target group). For an up-to-date position on all school performance data please refer to the Department for Education data at [www.education.gov.uk.](http://www.education.gov.uk) 3.1.33 Current housing tenure in Northumberland Park is predominantly Council and other social rented property, including large estates such as Northumberland Park to the east and Love Lane to the west. 30% of homes in the area are owner occupied, over 50% social rented and 18% private rented. Data from the GLA shows that workless households account for half of households in social rented homes, compared with 7% in owner occupied housing. Future of Northumberland Park 3.1.34 As a result of the proposed redevelopment of the existing Tottenham Hotspur Football Stadium, investment in the Northumberland Park area has started. Northumberland Park is an area with the potential for significant change and investment over the next 15 years. The redevelopment of the stadium provides opportunities for the ward to maximise the regeneration benefits to the local community. 3.1.35 Tottenham Hotspur Football Club has been based at White Hart Lane for over a century. The Stadium is an established part of the landscape, giving an identity to Tottenham. The Club is one of Haringey’s largest businesses and most significant visitor attraction. 3.1.36 The area in which the Club is set has, however, seen a long period of decline moving from relative prosperity to an area with high unemployment and deprivation and a poor local environment. ASPIRATIONS The Council’s aspirations for Northumberland Park include: - Provision of a mix of land uses including the redevelopment of the football stadium; - Provision of appropriate residential use, including new build and renewal; - Provision of appropriate retail and leisure uses to deliver a premier leisure destination in London; - Appropriate contributions to open space, community facilities, regeneration initiatives and employment and training schemes; - High quality, sustainable design that respects its surroundings and preserves and enhances the area’s historic environment; - Improving community safety, including reducing opportunities for crime and anti-­ social behaviour. 3.1.37 Further details on how the Council envisages Northumberland Park developing will be set out in an Area Action Plan. 57 Areas of Change Seven Sisters Corridor 3.1.38 Seven Sisters is a priority area for change and has a strategic role to play in the future growth of Haringey. The area has excellent road and public transport links, with a range of bus connections and London Underground stations at Seven Sisters, Finsbury Park and Manor House that provide access to North and central London. 3.1.39 The area is, however, characterised by high levels of multiple deprivation including unemployment, low educational achievements, poor/lack of affordable housing, a poor environment and high crime levels. It is therefore no coincidence that this area is also recognised as being within the 10% most deprived in England. 3.1.40 The Seven Sisters Road corridor extends into the adjoining boroughs of Hackney and Islington and runs between the Nags Head District Shopping Centre in Islington and the A10 at Seven Sisters Underground Station. The corridor has the potential to provide a focus for greater diversity, connectivity and opportunity across all three boroughs. This potential is recognised by its location within a nationally designated Growth Area and the presence of several major regeneration initiatives including the former Bridge New Deal for Communities (NDC) area in Haringey, The Woodberry Down Masterplan and Manor House Area Action Plan in Hackney, and significant large scale development at Finsbury Park in Islington. 3.1.41 The area’s ability to play a role in the future growth of the borough is highlighted by the opportunities presented by the above initiatives and the potential to build upon the area’s existing assets such as the Florentia clothing village as well as the future potential development of St Ann’s Hospital site. 3.1.42 The North London Strategic Alliance (NLSA) has commissioned a study to develop a greater understanding of the area’s growth potential and to bring together stakeholders in a collaborative forum in order to promote a more co-ordinated approach to growth. ASPIRATIONS The Council’s aspirations for the area include: - Cross borough working with Hackney and Islington to identify strategic priorities for the Seven Sisters Corridor and as such develop joint solutions; - Potential for new housing and social infrastructure including, where appropriate and viable, the provision of new green space and community facilities; - Opportunity for ensuring that the Seven Sisters area and the tube and train station provides land marks/gateways to aid legibility through redevelopment and/or renewal; - Scope for comprehensive mixed use at St Ann’s Hospital site; - Wards Corner regeneration delivering houses, shops and public realm improvements through redevelopment and/ or renewal; - Potential for future estate regeneration; - NDC Legacy Spatial Framework and Neighbourhood Plan; - Redeveloping Apex House as a strong district landmark building and gateway to Seven Sisters; and - Potential for a decentralised energy hub serving surrounding schools and housing estates. 58 Tottenham High Road Corridor (A10/A1010) 3.1.43 Tottenham High Road (Figure 3.5) is comprised of six contiguous Conservation Areas between Enfield to the north and Stamford Hill in Hackney to the south which include Tottenham Green and Bruce Grove. The High Road has a mixture of fine Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian buildings, some of which are listed by English Heritage as having special architectural and historical interest of national importance. 3.1.44 The High Road has been in decline over the years and continues to suffer from physical and environmental neglect. This has been due to the physical and economic deterioration of the area which suffers from a poor image and covers some of the most deprived wards in the UK. The poor visual quality of properties reflects the area’s low economic vitality, and the lack of suitable maintenance and repairs. Despite this, it is an historic corridor with many important buildings and has been of keen interest to English Heritage and Heritage Lottery Fund. 3.1.45 There are a number of large sites and open spaces along the High Road that have the potential for redevelopment and/or currently detract from the quality of the area and where redevelopment would be encouraged by Haringey and other key stakeholders. Further detail on how the Council sees this area developing will be set out in the Tottenham High Road Corridor Area Action Plan. Areas of limited change 3.1.46 Many parts of Haringey, particularly in the west of the borough, are predominantly residential in character. Significant areas of these are designated as Conservation Areas, for example parts of Crouch End, Highgate and Muswell Hill, and will have development over the next 15 years. However, the Council envisages this development to be of an incremental nature and it should not change the character of these areas. Please see SP11 and SP12 for more detail on the Council’s approach to promoting high quality places and conserving our heritage. 3.1.47 The Council will ensure that development in the areas of limited change respects the historic significance and character of its surroundings, conserves heritage and other important features and provides environmental improvements and other local benefits, where appropriate. 3.1.48 Major development taking place adjacent to or near areas of more limited change should bring benefits to these areas of an appropriate nature and scale. In particular, the Council will seek: 1. Contributions towards regeneration and training in deprived areas; and 2. The provision of open space and other community facilities where there are local deficiencies. 59 *Tottenham Hotspur Stadium* INDICATORS Monitoring 3.1.49 SP1 will be monitored regularly to ensure effective delivery of its aims and objectives over the life of the Local Plan. The Authority Monitoring Report will be used to assess the performance of the policy. The key infrastructure which will support the delivery of SP1 is set out in the Council’s Housing Trajectory and Appendix 4 (Infrastructure Delivery Plan).

In managing Haringey’s growth, new housing investment will be targeted at fostering the development of mixed and balanced communities across the Borough and within neighbourhoods. where people choose to live, which meet the housing needs of Haringey’s residents and offer quality and affordability, and are sustainable for current and future generations. This section of the Strategic Policies looks at: - The overall numbers of additional homes to be built in the Borough; - The proportion of affordable housing that the Council will seek; - The mix of sizes and types of homes that are needed for particular groups of people; - The design of high quality homes; - The need to undertake strategic improvement or renewal of existing housing estates; and - Gypsies and Travellers accommodation needs. *Crouch End* 3.2.2 The Council will seek to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to live in a decent home at a price they can afford and in a community where they want to live. The Council will therefore seek to establish a plentiful supply and a broad range of homes to meet the needs of particular groups of people over the life of the Local Plan. As the objective in Section 1 sets out, the Council aims to allocate sufficient sites to meet both its objectively assessed housing need of 1,345 homes per annum and its total strategic housing requirement of 19,800 net new homes over the plan period to 2026. In doing so, the Council also wishes to provide homes to meet Haringey’s housing needs, in terms of affordability, quality, diversity and creating mixed communities.. 61 SP2: HOUSING The Council will aim to provide homes to meet Haringey’s housing needs and to make the full use of Haringey’s capacity for housing by maximising the supply of additional housing to meet and exceed the minimum target of 19,802 homes from 2011-2026 (820 units per annum from 2011-2014 and 1,502 units per annum). Density and design standards to deliver quality homes Excellence in design quality and sustainability will be required for all new homes. High quality new residential development in Haringey will be provided by ensuring that new development: 1. Meets the density levels set out in the Density Matrix of the London Plan; 2. Is designed having regard to the housing design standards and space standards set out in the Mayor of London’s Housing SPG (March 2016) and the London Plan and the play space standards set out in the Mayor’s Play and Informal Recreation SPG 2012; 3. Aims to maximise housing for people whose circumstances makes them vulnerable and/or people with specific needs; and 4. 90% of new housing meets Building Regulation requirement M4(2) ‘accessible and adaptable dwellings’ and 10% meeting Building Regulations requirement M4(3) ‘wheelchair user dwelling’, ensuring they are designed to be wheelchair accessible or easily adaptable for wheelchair users. Units should range in size to accommodate various living needs including growing families and live-in carers. Secure high quality affordable housing Affordable housing shall be achieved by: 5. Subject to viability, sites capable of delivering 10 units of more will be required to meet a Borough wide affordable housing target of 40%, based on habitable rooms [1] ; 6. Delivering an affordable housing tenure split of 60% affordable rent (including social rent) and 40% intermediate housing; 7. The Council will aim to provide homes to meet Haringey’s housing needs and to make the full use of Haringey’s capacity for housing by maximising the supply of additional housing to meet and exceed the minimum target of 19,802 homes from 2011-2026 (820 units per annum from 2011-2014 and 1,502 units per annum from 2015-2026); 8. The preferred affordable housing mix, in terms of unit size and type of dwellings on individual 1 This equates to approximately 7,920 affordable dwellings over the plan period to 2026. schemes will be determined through negotiation, scheme viability assessments and driven by up to date assessments of local housing need, as set out in the Haringey Housing Strategy; 9. Ensuring no net loss of existing affordable housing floorspace in development; and 10.Ensuring affordable housing units are designed to a high quality and are fully integrated within schemes. Housing estates renewal and improvement 11.The Council will bring forward a programme to undertake strategic improvements to, or renewal of, Haringey’s housing estates, with priority being accorded to those located within wider regeneration proposals and/or identified as being most in need. An initial list is set out below: - Northumberland Park - Love Lane - Reynardson - Turner Avenue - Leabank View / Lemsford Close - Park Grove and Durnsford Road - Tunnel Gardens, including Blake Road - Noel Park - Broad Water Farm 12.Plan-Monitor-Manage Haringey’s Local Plan is based on research and evidence available when the document was prepared. However, the Council recognises that circumstances can change, and that the Plan needs to remain flexible and responsive over the plan period. In accordance with the plan-monitor-manage process, in the event that monitoring reveals a risk to either housing delivery or the realisation of the spatial strategy, the Council will assess the reasons for any variance and will consider appropriate interventions, which may include the release of further land for alternative uses, policy revisions or a re-assessment of the planning requirements applicable to specific forms of development. Such interventions/contingencies will be considered and brought forward by the Council on a strategic planning basis and should not be determined by individual sites/proposals. Alongside the monitoring of housing delivery, the Council will keep its Infrastructure Delivery Plan, which is intended to be a ‘live’ document, updated to ensure infrastructure delivery matches growth. 62 Maximising Housing Supply in Haringey 3.2.5 Haringey produces a housing trajectory as 3.2.3 The London Plan sets a London-wide target of 490,000 additional homes from 2015-2025 and a Haringey target of 15,020 additional dwellings over the same period (increasing the existing annual target from 820 to 1,502 additional homes per annum). 3.2.4 The Council’s annual housing target is provided through: - Development and redevelopment on large sites (over 0.25ha) and small sites (below 0.25ha), and conversions from residential and non-residential properties; - Non-self contained homes (these are homes that share common facilities or services, such as hostels, residential care homes and student accommodation); and - Vacant properties brought back into use (these are homes that have been unused for at least six months). part of its Authority Monitoring Report (AMR) and in line with paragraph 47 of the NPPF. The housing trajectory shows which sites are expected to come forward over the Plan period and measures Haringey’s performance in meeting its strategic housing target of 19,802 net new homes. For the period 2011/12 – 2025/26, the housing trajectory (see Appendix 2) shows that the supply of additional homes is expected to be approximately 22,000. This demonstrates sufficient capacity to exceed both the Borough’s objectively assessed need (13,450) and its strategic housing requirement (19,802) for the period of this Plan. Further, it also confirms the ability to bring forward additional sites from latter years of the housing trajectory to meet the requirement of an additional 5% buffer within the rolling fiveyear housing supply, as set out in the NPPF. In addition, it is expected that over the plan period there will be sites that come forward for housing other than those already identified. These sites are known as “windfall sites” and will contribute towards meeting the housing need in Haringey. Such sites will be assessed to ensure that they meet the needs of the community and do not harm the surrounding environment. 3.2.6 At the time of the examination the Council could demonstrate a 5.3 year housing land supply, taking into account the shortfall and applying a 5% buffer. 63 64 High quality homes 3.2.7 The Council will expect all new development to be built to the highest quality standards in line with the London Plan and the Mayor of London’s Housing SPG (March 2016), and will assess housing densities in planning applications in line with those set out in the London Plan Density Matrix while taking account of Haringey’s urban, suburban and central density settings as shown in the Haringey Urban Characterisation Study 2015. Appropriate density ranges are related to setting in terms of location, existing building form and massing and the index of Public Transport Accessibility Levels (PTAL).The Council will adopt a ‘design-led’ approach to density. 3.2.8 An investment programme was carried out to improve the condition of the Council’s social housing stock as part of the Government’s 2007 – 2010 Decent Homes programme with similar improvements being carried out by other social landlords in the borough. As of March 2010, 27.5% of Council stock did not meet the Decent Homes Standards. Some areas in the borough have a wide range of environmental issues, for example, poor design of estates, where the Council is looking beyond the upgrading of individual homes and focusing on wider estate renewal and reduction of CO 2 emissions. As domestic properties contribute to 50% of all CO 2 emissions in Haringey, improvements to the thermal efficiency of homes in the borough will be key to reducing fuel poverty and will contribute to the Mayor’s target of 60% reduction in carbon emissions in London by 2025. 3.2.9 Good quality housing design can improve social well-being and quality of life by reducing crime, improving public health, easing transport problems and increasing property values. Building for Life (BfL) promotes design excellence and celebrates best practice in the house building industry. Haringey will ensure that CABE’s Building for Life criteria are used to evaluate the quality of new housing developments across the borough and that all new affordable housing funded through the Affordable Housing Programme meets or exceeds the minimum standards set by the Mayor. In addition, the Council will expect good quality housing design to be contextually sensitive so that it positively contributes to the local and historic character of an area/ neighbourhood. Please see SP11 Design for the Council’s approach to good quality design. 3.2.10 The Council recognise converted and shared houses as an important source of housing in the borough, especially for small and low income households. Conversions and Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) will have to meet all design and space standards set out in the Mayor of London’s Housing SPG, and other relevant design guidance, in terms of minimum floorspace, habitable rooms, layout, dwelling mix, amenity space and privacy, and have a positive impact on the amenity, streetscape and character of the surrounding area of the development. Further detail on conversions and HMOs will be set out in the Council’s emerging Development Management Policies document. Meeting Housing Need 3.2.11 Haringey’s resident Survey 2009 showed that 26% of residents consider affordable decent homes to be the most important thing in making somewhere a good place to live, and 17% think that it is the thing that most needs improving in the local area. Housing need is reflected in high demand for affordable housing. 3.2.12 The North London sub-region Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2011) and Haringey’s 2014 Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) sets out the overall amount of housing required in the Borough in the first five years of the Plan, and informs the housing mix, household size, the need for, and level of, specialist housing to be provided to meet the Borough’s housing need. 65 Lifetime homes and housing for people with specific needs 3.2.13 The Council considers that all new dwellings should be accessible to most people, and therefore suitable to a wide range of potential occupants. The Council also recognises that Haringey’s population is projected to increase in age over the next 10 years, with the 65+ population increasing to 26,923 by 2021 (a 19.7% increase since 2011), and nearing 10% of the total borough population. This trend is projected to continue, and the ability to adapt dwellings will ensure individuals with reduced mobility and, in particular, those requiring the use of a wheelchair, can remain in their home and independent longer. Family Housing 3.2.14 In order to encourage mixed and balanced communities, the Council will aim to ensure that an adequate mix of dwelling sizes is delivered within new developments, while protecting existing family housing. The lack of family housing in Haringey has resulted in significant overcrowding. Low to median income households with large families are likely to be more affected by overcrowding due to lack of choice of available affordable family homes. Responding to these issues is a priority for the Council. Along with the provision of new and affordable housing, the Council will aim to meet the need for family housing and alleviate the problem of overcrowding through a number of other approaches such as: assisting smaller households living in overcrowded properties to find their own home; and assisting residents living in under occupied properties to find more suitable accommodation. Affordable housing 3.2.15 In line with the NPPF, affordable housing is defined as that provided to eligible households whose needs are not met by the market. Types of affordable housing include social rented, affordable rented and intermediate housing. The Council require a range of products and an appropriate balance of affordable housing to meet housing need in the borough. The strategic target for tenure split is currently 60% affordable rent (including social rent) and 40% intermediate affordable housing products. This is based on current evidence of housing as set out in the London Plan products. 3.2.16 The SHMA (2011) provides clear evidence of housing need in the borough, both for affordable and market housing. Within this, there is a significant need among those on lower incomes for affordable housing at a level equal to social rents. Consequently developers of private housing will be expected to deliver affordable housing at rent levels that are truly affordable to local people, having regard to local housing need and affordability. 3.2.17 The SHMA identifies a need for all sizes and tenures of housing, especially affordable one bedroom units, market and affordable two bedroom units, market and affordable 3 or more bedroom units. This represents a challenge for the borough in that many of those in priority need and in temporary accommodation require larger units. The Council will work closely with its partners to ensure the provision of a suitable and adequate mix of tenures and sizes of dwellings are provided over the plan period in accordance with SP2 and Policy DM16 of the Development Management DPD. 3.2.18 Housing developments with the capacity to provide 10 or more units will be required to deliver affordable housing to meet an overall borough target of 40%. This provision will depend on the location, scheme details and site characteristics. 66 3.2.19 Haringey’s Development Appraisals and Viability Testing (GVA 2015), demonstrates that a 40% affordable housing target is achievable and viable, if applied sensitively. In terms of viability, the study also concludes that schemes below the ten unit threshold can provide 20% affordable housing on site, based on habitable rooms, or provide fnancial contribution towards affordable housing provision. During the downturn in the housing market each scheme will be examined carefully in order not to restrain residential development. Further detail on negotiating affordable housing will be set out in the Development Management Policies document. 3.2.20 The Council will seek to achieve the maximum reasonable proportion of affordable housing through negotiating section 106 agreements on all suitable development sites. Affordable housing should be provided on-site so that it contributes to achieving the objective of creating more mixed communities and avoids creating concentrations of deprivation. 3.2.21 There may be physical or other circumstances where off-site provision would be preferable or cases where the off-site provision would be of superior quality than that which could be provided on-site. The Council recognises that off-site provision misses the opportunity for creating mixed and balanced communities and will only be acceptable in exceptional circumstances where the Council is satisfed that the preferred unit mix and tenure of affordable housing could not be provided on-site. 3.2.22 Only in exceptional circumstances, where it is considered appropriate to provide the affordable housing off site, a higher proportion of affordable housing will be sought in order to refect the fact that the development achieved 100% private market housing on the initial site. The two sites should be considered together for the purpose of calculating the affordable housing to be provided to ensure that the percentage of affordable housing delivered is 40% of the total number of habitable rooms developed across both sites. The ratio of affordable housing to private market housing when provided on site would be 1:1. Therefore 100% of the habitable rooms provided on an alternative site should be affordable. 3.2.23 According to CABE’s Building for Life criteria, successful developments fully integrate the tenure mix, avoiding differentiation between individual dwellings and parts of the scheme based on their area. Therefore, the Council will seek to avoid large single tenure developments or the predominance of a single tenure type in any one area. 3.2.24 The Council’s frst Borough Investment Plan (BIP) September 2010 highlights the diverse needs of Haringey’s communities, focusing on Haringey as a place with planned regeneration, housing and associated infrastructure projects, ftting together as part of Local Area Plans. This represents a shift away from the reactive programme based approach towards the place shaping approach to meet local community needs. 3.2.25 A signifcant proportion of the new homes delivered over the next ten years will be supplied at Tottenham Hale and Haringey Heartlands, which are designated as an Area of Opportunity and Area for Intensifcation respectively. The BIP details these and other signifcant regeneration opportunities in Haringey, particularly the wider Tottenham area including the Seven Sisters Corridor linking through from the major regeneration of Woodberry Down in Hackney to Tottenham Hale (including Lawrence Road) and extending to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium development and other strategic projects such as Hornsey Town Hall and Hornsey Depot sites. These projects will create mixed and sustainable communities by delivering new housing across a range of tenures and sizes, and by recognising supported housing requirements for vulnerable people and promoting training and employment opportunities. 67 Strategic Improvement or Renewal of Haringey’s Housing Estates 3.2.26 While efforts have been taken through the Decent Homes Programme, to bring Council’s existing housing stock up to an acceptable modern living standard, this is not feasible for all homes or Council estates. On some estates, the building’s construction and/or layout presents practical constraints to making further modifcations and improvements. On others, parts or all of the estate are poorly laid out, which continues to hamper efforts to improve access to public transport, create better and more useable amenity spaces, or to address areas that suffer from anti-social behaviour. There are also estates where redevelopment would provide the opportunity to reprovide the existing social housing but also realise a signifcant increase in overall housing provision, which could make a signifcant contribution towards meeting the Borough’s considerable housing need, provide greater housing choice, and help to cross-­ subsidise the costs of modernising the existing housing stock. 3.2.27 The consideration of potential redevelopment options, for individual renewal estates, should have regard to the potential heritage interest of the estate and to existing social and community facilities that support the existing community. 3.2.28 In accordance with s105 of the Housing Act 1985, prior to embarking on any estate renewal project, the Council will actively engage with the existing residents to seek their views and input into potential redevelopment options. The Council will also appoint an independent advisor who can advise residents of their rights and options at all stages throughout the renewal process. The options available to existing tenants and leaseholders are outlined in Council Housing Strategy. 3.2.29 Where the Council undertakes estate renewal, it will seek to reprovide the same amount of social rented housing (as defned in the glossary) with new social rented housing on an equivalent foorspace basis. This is because redevelopment of the existing social housing stock offers the opportunity to tailor the social housing to be reprovided to better meet changing housing needs of existing residents, including the acute need for more family sized social housing as set out in the Housing Strategy. Where strategic improvements or estate renewal propose an overall uplift in housing numbers on site, the affordable housing policies of the Local Plan will apply and will take into account the replacement of social rented housing, the 40% borough-wide affordable housing foorspace target, and development viability in seeking the maximum reasonable provision. 3.2.30 In addition to estate renewal, the Council has also identifed, as part of its Housing Investment & Estate Renewal Strategy (November 2013), a number of medium and small infll sites, where additional new homes might be built on Council owned land. It is anticipated that these initiatives could deliver 150 new homes over the next fve to ten years, providing greater housing choice, including low cost home ownership, and making effcient use of Council held property. Where appropriate, sites will be allocated in the Local Plan to facilitate delivery of these programmes. 68 Key evidence and references - Haringey Strategic Housing Market Assessment, GVA 2014 - Haringey Development Appraisals and Viability Testing, GVA 2015 - Haringey’s Housing Strategy, London Borough of Haringey 2016 - The London Plan, Mayor of London 2011 - National Planning Policy Framework 2012 - Affordable Housing Viability Study, London Borough of Haringey 2010 - North London Strategic Housing Market Assessment, ORS 2011 - Haringey’s Older People’s Housing Strategy 2011 - 2021, London Borough of Haringey 2011 - Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance, Mayor of London 2012 *Roden Court, Crouch End* INDICATORS Monitoring 3.2.31 SP2 will be monitored regularly to ensure effective delivery of its aims and objectives over the life of the Local Plan.

The key infrastructure which will support the delivery of SP2 is set out in the Council’s Housing Trajectory and Appendix 4 (Infrastructure Delivery Plan). 69 3.3.1 One of the key priorities for Haringey is to provide a home for everyone in a safe environment with access to services and facilities. The Council will ensure that the needs of Gypsy and Traveller communities are met in a fair and equal way, which respects their traditional and nomadic way of life. 3.3.2 The Council will work with its partners to identify and deliver suitable sites for Gypsies and Travellers in the borough, in line with national policy and the London Plan. 3.3.3 The Council will aim to promote appropriate and well managed sites to meet the needs of the Gypsy and Traveller communities and to ensure integration with surrounding communities. New potential sites will be identifed in the Site Allocations Document. SP3: PROVISION OF LAND FOR GYPSIES AND TRAVELLERS The Council will protect existing lawful sites, plots and pitches for Gypsies and Travellers. The redevelopment of such sites will not be permitted unless they are replaced by equivalent or improved sites, plots and/or pitches in suitable locations within Haringey. Any new site or substantial alteration to an existing site shall: - Provide satisfactory layout and facilities in terms of pitches, hardstanding, parking, turning space, amenity blocks, open space and play areas; - Be capable of connection to energy, water and sewage infrastructure; - Be accessible to public transport, services and facilities, and be capable of support by local social infrastructure; - Provide safe access to and from the main road network; - Not cause harm to the residential amenity or the operational effciency of nearby properties; and - Not cause harm to/or the loss of designated Metropolitan Open Land, Sites of Nature Conservation Importance, woodland and watercourses. Land for Gypsies and Travellers 3.3.4 Haringey will identify land for Gypsies’ and Travellers’ sites in response to Planning Policy for Gypsy Traveller Sites (2012). In order to meet the need identified in The London Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Needs Assessment (GTANA) 2008, the Council will require four additional pitches up to 2017. The Council is producing a new Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Needs Assessment (GTANA) to identify additional need beyond 2017. 3.3.5 There are two existing permanent Gypsy and Traveller sites in Haringey providing 10 pitches, one at Wallman Place, N22 and one on Clyde Road, N15. The Council will continue to safeguard these sites and refurbish where needed. Any potential new sites will be identified in the Site Allocations Document. INDICATORS Monitoring 3.3.6 SP3 will be monitored regularly to ensure effective delivery of its aims and objectives over the life of the Local Plan.

Climate change means that in the future London will experience hotter summers and wetter winters. Weather events which are considered as extreme today are likely to become far more frequent. The biggest impact on individuals and communities will be the increasing risk of floods, droughts and heat waves. This will have implications for people’s health, safety and comfort, food production, biodiversity and infrastructure. Risks in London are set out in the Mayor’s Adaptation Strategy. The Local Plan has an important role in reducing Haringey’s environmental impact and achieving sustainable development – meeting our social, environmental and economic needs in ways that protect the environment and do not harm our ability to meet our needs in the future. An Environmentally Sustainable Future is one of the priorities of Haringey’s Sustainable Community Strategy. 4.1.2 As the objectives in Section 1 set out, the Council wishes to limit climate change by reducing CO 2 emissions through increased energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy sources, through the establishment of decentralised energy networks at Tottenham Hale and Haringey Heartlands. 4.1.3 Spatial policy responses to energy use, climate change and its associated risks are considered in this section with policies relating to limiting CO 2 emissions, decentralised energy, sustainable transport, water management and flooding. Policies also address underlying issues of resource management, waste and recycling. The challenge of climate change applies to all policies in the Local Plan. SP11 sets out specific design and construction responses to climate change mitigation and adaptation. 4.1.4 Tackling climate change will also require a move towards more sustainable energy sources and the London Plan seeks to support the development of decentralised energy systems, including the use of low carbon and renewable energy, and the greater utilisation of energy generated from waste. 72 SP4: WORKING TOWARDS A LOW CARBON HARINGEY Over the life time of the Local Plan, reducing energy use in buildings and working towards a low carbon borough will be one of the key challenges facing Haringey. The Council will promote the measures outlined below to reduce carbon emissions from new and existing buildings. 1. In line with London Plan policy, the Council will promote and require all new developments to take measures to reduce energy use and carbon emissions during design, construction and occupation, by incorporating the following measures: a. From 2011 onwards, all new residential development will achieve a minimum 25% reduction in total (regulated) CO 2 emissions in line with Code for Sustainable Homes Level 4 energy standards, and should aim to achieve Level 6. All new residential development shall be zero carbon from 2016 onwards; and b. From 2011 onwards all new non-residential development shall be built to at least BREEAM “very good” standard and should aim to achieve BREEAM “excellent” or the current nationally agreed standard. All new non-residential development shall be zero carbon from 2019. 2. The Council will promote low- and zero-carbon energy generation through the following measures: a. Requiring all developments to assess, identify and implement, where viable, site-wide and area-wide decentralised energy facilities including the potential to link into a wider network; b. Establishing local networks of decentralised heat and energy facilities by requiring developers to prioritise connection to existing or planned networks where feasible; c. Working with neighbouring boroughs and other partners to explore ways of implementing sub-regional decentralised energy networks including the potential in the Upper Lee Valley Opportunity Area; and d. All new developments are required, where viable, to achieve a reduction in predicted carbon dioxide emissions of 20% from on site renewable energy regeneration, which can include connections to local sources of decentralised renewable energy. Climate Change in Haringey 4.1.5 Regional studies indicate that London will expect climatic changes of hotter summers and wetter winters with incidences of heat waves and flash flooding becoming more frequent. 4.1.6 The Council aims to reduce the carbon footprint of development in Haringey. This includes the efficient use of land and buildings in order to reduce car dependency, the implementation of an energy hierarchy in building design and construction, the use of energy from more efficient sources such as decentralised energy networks (or making connections to such networks feasible in the future) and by requiring the generation of energy on-site by use of renewable energy. 4.1.7 The Council’s overall strategy for managing future growth in Haringey is to steer new development with high transport demand to areas with significant redevelopment opportunities at, or near, transport hubs; to support sustainable modes of travel by minimising car parking provision in new development; to increase cycle parking provision and encourage modal shift through travel planning and design of public realm to support non-car use (please see SP1 Managing Growth and SP7 Transport). 4.1.8 The Council commissioned a report on carbon reduction scenarios (2006) for Haringey, which found that use of fossil fuel based energy in domestic buildings is responsible for almost 50% of CO 2 emissions in the borough. This relates to space heating and cooling, lighting, cooking and other energy use in our homes. The study assessed the necessary measures to meet the adopted target of reducing CO 2 emissions by 60% by 2050 on a 1990 baseline. These include: - Renewable energy systems, both integrated and stand alone; - Energy efficiency improvements to the existing building stock; - Transport demand reduction and shift to sustainable transport modes; - Community heating network served by combined heat and power (CHP); and - CHP for large buildings such as hospitals and schools. 73 *Cycle Lanes* 4.1.9 Haringey signed up to the Nottingham Declaration in 2006. Following this, the Council launched its Greenest Borough Strategy in 2008 which sets out how the Council will take forward actions to tackle climate change and embed environmental sustainability into everything we do. 4.1.10 Haringey has extensive Conservation Areas and significant historic heritage. When considering decentralised energy options, whether they are micro-generation or larger schemes, consideration will be given to minimising physical impacts on the historic fabric of buildings and ensuring reversibility wherever practicable. Poorly designed measures could seriously detract from the historic character and fabric of buildings and landscapes, whereas well-designed measures, sensitive to the historic context, can contribute to the borough’s targets for reducing CO 2 emissions. 4.1.11 In October 2009 Haringey Council adopted an aspirational target to reduce borough wide CO 2 emissions by 40% by 2020 on a 2005 baseline and committed to developing an action plan to meet this target. This fulfills a commitment to establish a long term CO 2 reduction target, which was made in the Greenest Borough Strategy. *Community-owned solar array on Marks & Spencer* *roof, Muswell Hill Broadway* 4.1.12 A Carbon Reduction Action Plan is being developed as part of the Department for Communities and Local Government, Local Carbon Frameworks pilot programme. This will be developed with Haringey Strategic Partnership, the voluntary sector and businesses. Over the next two years the Council is also working with the Carbon Trust, Carbon Management Programme to implement a carbon reduction strategy to deliver a 40% reduction in CO 2 emissions from our corporate estate and operations by 2015. Adapting to Climate Change 4.1.13 Buildings and places will need to be planned, designed and constructed to respond to future anticipated changes in climate, such as: warmer and wetter winters and hotter, drier summers and the risks associated with such changes; urban heat island effect; heat waves; flooding and droughts. The urban heat island effect is used to describe a situation where higher ambient temperatures are experienced after sunset in urban areas in comparison with rural areas. In London this is most intense at night as buildings and roads absorb more solar radiation than green space and vegetation. In addition to policies in Section 4 and 6, the Council sets out the measures required to alleviate the anticipated climate change risks in its emerging Development Management Policies and the Sustainable Design and Construction SPD. 74 Low and Zero Carbon Buildings 4.1.14 Haringey will require new homes to reach, as a minimum, the energy standards of the Code for Sustainable Homes (CSH) Level 4 from 2010 and Zero Carbon by 2016. The Council has commissioned research into opportunities for the incorporation of low and zero carbon technologies and decentralised energy networks within new developments in the borough. The Climate Change, Site Development and Infrastructure Study 2009 involved testing policy targets on selected sites in Haringey. The sites were selected on the basis of their representative nature as well as the range of different scales, uses, opportunities and constraints that they presented. The study indicates that investigated sites can achieve energy reduction targets of the Code Level 4 and in most instances higher than CSH Level 4. The equivalent of CO 2 reduction targets in Code Level 4 for Sustainable Homes is 25% reduction in total regulated CO 2 emissions in comparison with total emissions from a building which complies with 2006 Building Regulations. 4.1.15 In December 2008, the Government published Definition of Zero Carbon Homes and Non Domestic Buildings: Consultation document, consulting on the definition of zero carbon homes and in particular an approach based on: - High levels of energy efficiency in the fabric of the home; - A minimum level of carbon reduction to be achieved on-site or through directly connected heat; and - A list of (mainly offsite) allowable solutions for dealing with the remaining emissions (including from appliances). 4.1.16 The Code does not prescribe how to achieve this target, but the London Plan requires that all developments adopt an energy hierarchy. The Council will expect all development to be designed in accordance with the following energy hierarchy: 1. Be lean: use less energy 2. Be clean: supply energy efficiency 3. Be green: use renewable energy 4.1.17 For residential buildings, carbon reduction standards became stricter from 2011, and for non-domestic buildings the standard will be zero carbon by 2019. Through Area Action Plans, the Council will consider the feasibility of reaching zero carbon for residential developments before 2016 in line with the priorities of Haringey’s Greenest Borough Strategy, and may set higher standards to be achieved in other Development Plan Documents in response to future national, regional and local guidance and evidence. Decentralised energy 4.1.18 The Mayor’s 2007 Climate Change Action Plan sets targets for 25% of London’s heat and power to be met through decentralised generation by 2025. Therefore, it is important that in order to meet these ambitions all possibilities for site-wide or neighbourhood wide decentralised energy options and renewable energy options are considered. 4.1.19 Decentralised energy predominantly means combined heat and power (CHP) used in combination with district heating systems, where appropriate. CHP systems can be gas fired or waste fed and, at the present time, are a more efficient way of meeting local electricity and heating demands compared with the traditional approach of inputting electricity from centralised power stations and the use of local gas-fired boilers. The Council will continue to monitor whether there are any more efficient schemes to fulfil this function. 4.1.20 Over time these systems can be supported by or replaced by alternative fuels such as biomass, biogas, and other low to zero carbon energy sources as they become more technically and commercially viable. 4.1.21 Major developments should assess the practicality and viability of connecting to existing heating and cooling networks, provision of site wide Combined Heat and Power network, and communal heating and cooling systems. 75 4.1.22 The Council is in the process of identifying locations for potential decentralised energy network hubs. Based on the various studies outlined above, an indicative map (Figure 4.1) has been developed for potential decentralised energy network clusters. These include Haringey Heartlands and Tottenham Hale growth areas, a south-east hub focusing on St Ann’s Hospital site, Lawrence Road and Broadwater Farm complex, and a north hub around Northumberland Park. There is also the potential for a decentralised energy hub in the Crouch End area. These indicative hubs and other opportunities will be explored in more detail in Area Action Plans for Northumberland Park, Tottenham Hale and Wood Green / Haringey Heartlands and in the Council’s Sustainable Design and Construction SPD. 4.1.23 The Council is working with key stakeholders to develop a decentralised energy feasibility study for selected sites to identify financial and operational matters to assist with future implementation of such networks. The London Heat map is a map-based data tool to assist developers and local authorities in identifying and implementing decentralised energy. Over time, Haringey and its partners will populate the London Heat Map with Haringey-specific information on heat load and demand, and identify opportunities for new developments or major retrofitting projects to connect to or, future proof buildings and sites to connect to, future decentralised networks. 4.1.24 Therefore, in areas where future network opportunities are identified, development proposals should be designed to connect to these networks or assessed to find out whether there are opportunities to extend their decentralised energy system beyond the site boundary to adjacent sites. 4.1.25 The list of sites identified in Figure 4.1 is not exhaustive. The Council will welcome new sites, opportunities and proposals to come forward through the development process and future assessments. The Council will also work with the GLA to identify further sites for decentralised energy options and renewable energy generation where possible, in line with the London Plan. 4.1.26 The draft North London Waste Plan has considered the potential for linking heat from waste fed CHP systems to new developments and where opportunities arise, Haringey will support the use of community heating associated with waste management sites. The Council, the GLA and neighbouring boroughs are also working on an Opportunity Area Framework for the Upper Lee Valley, which includes an energy network study. 4.1.27 In line with the London Plan energy hierarchy, the Council expects developments to achieve a reduction in predicted carbon dioxide emissions of minimum 20% through the use of on-site renewable energy generation, unless it can be demonstrated that such provision is not feasible. The majority of the sites investigated in the Climate Change, Site Development and Infrastructure Study 2009 are found to support the utilisation of renewable energy technologies to achieve a 20% reduction in predicted CO 2 emissions. Existing housing stock 4.1.28 The existing housing stock represents a large proportion of carbon emissions in Haringey. Haringey’s interactive heat loss map indicates that many existing houses are very inefficient. As much of the housing standing today will still be in use in 2026, it is necessary to improve the energy efficiency of the existing stock to achieve local, regional and national aspirations for carbon emission reductions. The Council envisage that by 2026 nearly all feasible carbon emissions reduction measures will have been carried out on existing housing stock. This work has already started. Muswell Hill has been designated a Low Carbon Zone (one of ten in London). The Council will use this to demonstrate how ambitious cuts in carbon emission reductions can be achieved by retrofitting buildings for better insulation and energy efficiency measures, the use of renewable energy technologies and promoting behavioural change. Retrofitting measures must have due regard for historic significance, as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework. 77 *South Tottenham* 4.1.29 The Council will work with its partners to identify further areas, streets and neighbourhoods for concerted improvements to existing housing stock including solid wall properties. The Council has published a guide to assist local people interested in house renovations on how to improve the energy efficiency of their homes. INDICATORS Monitoring 4.1.30 SP4 will be monitored regularly to ensure effective delivery of its aims and objectives over the life of the Local Plan. The Authority Monitoring Report will be used to assess the performance of the policy, measured using a list of indicators as set out in Appendix 3. The key infrastructure, which will support the delivery of SP4 is set out in Appendix 4 (Infrastructure Delivery Plan). 78 SP5: WATER MANAGEMENT AND FLOODING The Council will require all development in Haringey to be water effcient during construction and operation and to reduce all forms of food risk. All development shall: - Improve the water environment, water quality and drainage systems; - Minimise water use and illustrate how development would contribute to general and fash fooding; - Take account of flood risk vulnerability classification as set out in paragraph 100 of the NPPF and will apply the NPPF Sequential Test and Exception Test; - Implement measures to prevent (or mitigate as last resort) local surface water and downstream flooding; - Implement Sustainable Drainage Systems from strategic to individual site level to improve water attenuation, quality and amenity; - Restore and enhance the Blue Ribbon Network including Pymmes Brook, Moselle Brook, the River Lee and its tributaries, deculverting wherever feasible, to improve water quality and amenity of these waterways and to help reduce food risk (in line with London River Action Plan); and - Require higher resilience and levels of flood protection for critical infrastructure to ensure the protection of essential services such as water and power. In order to facilitate this, the Council: - Has carried out a joint SFRA (Strategic Flood Risk Assessment) Stage 1 for the whole borough; - Has carried out a Sequential Test for the Areas of Development (Growth Areas and Areas of Change); - Is carrying out, in association with other north London boroughs in the Drain London sub-region, a Surface Water Management Plan to identify issues with drainage networks and the effects of new development. 4.2.1 The water environment is a valuable recreational, educational and leisure resource for the residents of Haringey. From the large reservoirs of the Lee Valley to small ponds in parks and gardens, it is a resource that needs to be protected. Developments should ensure measures are incorporated to protect and improve water quality for surface and groundwaters, particularly in areas of land contamination. An increase in residential and commercial developments in the growth areas of Haringey Heartlands and Tottenham Hale will increase demand for water and abstraction from rivers. Too much water taken from rivers can cause problems for wildlife and increase the risk of pollution, as there is less water available to dilute pollutants. River Lee 4.2.2 The River Lee downstream of Tottenham Lock has poor chemical and biological water quality. This is partly due to the confuence of the River Lee and Pymmes Brook at Tottenham Lock. Pymmes Brook has historically poor chemical water quality and Haringey is working closely with other boroughs to improve this. The River Lee and River Lee Navigation’s use of water storage bodies and its associated open space, is a key location in aiding food risk management. The River Lee and the large reservoirs of the Lee Valley is a resource to be protected and enhanced and Haringey are working closely with the Lee Valley Park Authority to continue to improve the area in terms of flooding and sustainable development. Haringey is also working closely with neighbouring boroughs and strategic authorities regarding the Water Framework Directive targets for the Thames River Basement Management Plan, in particular the physical modifcation of water bodies, abstraction and diffusion of pollution from urban sources. 79 Water Demand 4.2.3 The combination of climate change, predicted growth in population and increased water usage will exacerbate demand for water. Therefore, along with the increase in the intensity of rainfall, and the increased amount of hard surfaces in our environment, there is a greater pressure on the drainage systems. Haringey requires that new developments should aim to decrease the demand for water as much as possible. Haringey will require the incorporation of water saving measures and equipment in all new development in order to meet the London Plan water consumption targets of 105l/p/d. Sewage Services 4.2.4 Haringey is served by both Beckton (Newham) and Deephams (Enfield) main sewage treatment works. Thames Water own and manage the network of public foul and surface water sewers in Haringey and in London. Thames Water is implementing a number of Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive / Water Framework legislation-driven projects to improve the quality of water within London’s rivers. These include improvements to the five largest Sewage Treatment Works (STW) discharging into the tidal reaches of the River Thames, to treat sewage to a higher standard before discharge and to fully treat more flow, as well as the proposed London Tideway Tunnels (Thames Tunnel and Lee Tunnel), each of which will deal with combined sewer overflows (CSOs), and also the partial replacement of the Deephams sewage treatment works. Of significant strategic importance for London is the proposed Lee Tunnel and the Thames Tunnel, which aim to reduce the incidence of sewage discharges into the River Lee and the Thames, respectively. Flood risk 4.2.5 Implications of anticipated change in climate in the UK increased frequency in extreme weather conditions and the possibility of flash floods are being considered carefully. The borough contains areas of flood risk in proximity to Pymmes Brook on Pinkham Way, the Moselle Brook and the River Lee. In Haringey, risk areas include parts of the Lee Valley and South Tottenham (as identified in the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment) and areas identified by the Environment Agency mapped data showing areas susceptible to flooding. According to the Environment Agency, approximately 9% of land in Haringey has one in 100 year probability of flooding from rivers. About 8,000 properties are at risk of flooding although the defences such as the River Lee flood relief channel reduce the risk of this happening. 4.2.6 In developing this document the Council has worked on a Strategic Flood Risk Assessment for the borough and consulted with the Environment Agency on measures which are necessary to reduce flood risk in the area and suitable mitigation where risk is identified. The best form of flood mitigation is to encourage development in areas of lower flood risk. Where a risk of flooding is identified, a Sequential Test will be required, as set out in paragraph 100 of the NPPF. The Council will prepare Area Action Plans for Tottenham Hale and Northumberland Park. This more detailed work will be informed by the Level 2 Strategic Flood Risk Assessments and will identify development sites and the quantum and type of development needed. Masterplanning exercises and development briefs will ensure that flood risk is considered at an early stage, at an appropriate scale and in close consultation with the Environment Agency. Sequential Tests will be conducted to ensure proposals are in accordance with the NPPF, and flood risk assessments for individual development proposals will need to demonstrate that development is safe. 80 4.2.7 The Flood and Water Management Act 2010 brings responsibilities to Local Authorities for more comprehensive management of flood risk for people, homes and businesses. Haringey forms part of the Drain London Forum, a partnership including London boroughs, the Environment Agency and the Mayor of London, which is formed to ensure the requirements from the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 are met in producing a Surface Water Management Plan (SWMP). The development of SWMPs include a Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment for Haringey, and for the other sub-regional boroughs to investigate and address flood risk problems. 4.2.8 Haringey will maintain a public register of Flood Risk Management assets by 2015. Following the PFRA, the Council will: 1. Finalise a Surface Water Management Plan; 2. Prepare a Hazard Map for 2013; and Prepare a Flood Risk Management Plan for 2015. 4.2.9 Increased flood risk due to anticipated changes in the climate also requires the Council to consider measures for adapting to climate change and focus on minimising the flood risk in the area. Hard and soft landscaping associated with new development must take account of sustainable land management practices and managing the risk of flooding by applying Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) in order to improve water attenuation, quality and amenity. The provision of green features, including green roofs, provides opportunities to reduce runoff rates and enhance biodiversity, and are fully encouraged in both new development and retrofitting in older buildings. 4.2.10 In addition, the Development Management Policies and Site Allocations Document set out borough-wide standards and guidance for managing flood risk through development, including those relating to: - The need to address non-fluvial sources of flooding; - The use and design of water recycling; - Requirements for site-specific Flood Risk Assessments; - The use and design of water attenuation (in line with the drainage hierarchy set out in the London Plan); - The use and design of SUDS; - The design and layout of developments, including setting built developments back from rivers, watercourses and flood defences; and - Requirements for implementation of flood resilient and resistant building techniques. INDICATORS Monitoring 4.2.11 SP5 will be monitored regularly to ensure effective delivery of its aims and objectives over the life of the Local Plan. The Authority Monitoring Report will be used to assess the performance of the policy, measured using a list of indicators as set out in Appendix 3. The key infrastructure which will support the delivery of SP5 are set out in Appendix 4. 81 82 SP6: WASTE AND RECYCLING The Council supports the objectives of sustainable waste management set out by the Government in PPS10 Planning for Sustainable Waste Management and the Mayor’s London Plan. To achieve these, the Council shall: - Safeguard existing waste sites unless compensatory provision is made; - Maximise self-sufficiency in waste management capacity; - Seek to minimise waste creation, increase recycling rates in relation to commercial, industrial and municipal waste in order to achieve the Mayor’s recycling targets; - Address waste as a resource and look to disposal as the last option, in line with the Mayor’s waste hierarchy; - Require integrated, well-designed recycling facilities to be incorporated into all new developments; - Monitor changes in the stock of waste management facilities, waste arisings, and the amount of waste recycled, recovered and going for disposal; and - Continue working with its partners in the North London Waste Authority to adopt the North London Waste Plan (NLWP) which has identified locations suitable for waste management facilities to meet the London Plan apportionment of 1.9 2.1m tonnes and the Haringey apportionment of 237,000 182,000 tonnes. Haringey will require Site Waste Management Plans for all major applications to identify volume and types of demolition and construction waste and to demonstrate how waste will be minimised and managed during construction and occupation. New waste management facilities will be required to take into account and minimise pollution and nuisance issues. This is addressed in more detail in the Development Management Policies document. Dealing with waste and encouraging recycling 4.3.1 Haringey is committed to the sustainable management of waste through prioritising waste reduction, reuse and recycling, as reflected in the Sustainable Community Strategy and the Greenest Borough Strategy. Over the previous three years around a quarter of the borough’s household waste has been recycled, reducing the amount that is sent for disposal. All households and schools in the borough now have access to convenient and comprehensive recycling facilities, with facilities at a number of community centres and on-street recycling points on high streets and around transport hubs. There are two Reuse & Recycling Centres in the borough for residents to bring unwanted items to, and these accept an increasing range of materials and items for reuse or recycling. The Council will promote the generation of renewable energy from waste as set out in the London Plan. Please also see SP4 Working Towards a Low Carbon Haringey for more detail. 4.3.2 North London is expected to manage over 1.5 million tonnes of waste per year by 2025. Whilst the Council will continue to develop its waste reduction and recycling policies to minimise the environmental impact of municipal waste under its control, it will be necessary for North London to develop new solutions and facilities for managing waste sustainably, and as far as possible, within the boundaries of the sub-region. 83 4.3.3 In this context, the seven North London boroughs that constitute the North London Waste Authority are developing the North London Waste Plan (NLWP), a planning framework with the aim of identifying suitable and viable sites to meet the sub-region’s future waste management needs and satisfy the apportionment targets of the London Plan. The plan is part of each borough’s Local Plan. 4.3.4 The NLWP will identify suffcient sites to meet the London Plan apportionment.. 4.3.5 The Council’s policy approach is to continue to safeguard existing waste management sites, and adhere to the following principles and requirements: Wherever feasible the intensification and re-­ orientation of existing waste management sites are required before new sites are developed. Developers will be required to apply sequential tests to confirm this; - Only high quality waste development proposals will be considered suitable, in terms of design, minimisation of nuisance, transport and other potentially negative impacts; - Decentralised energy options shall be fully considered; - Developments within the North London Waste Plan area will require on-site provision for the management of construction, demolition and excavation of waste; and - The NLWP makes no site specific provision for hazardous waste, existing facilities are safeguarded and any application for new facilities will be treated on its merits in line with the policies of the NLWP. Please see the Development Management Policies and the Sustainable Design and Construction SPD for more detail. *Haringey’s Recycling Bins* 84 INDICATORS Monitoring 4.3.6 SP6 will be monitored regularly to ensure effective delivery of its aims and objectives over the life of the Local Plan. The Authority Monitoring Report will be used to assess the performance of the policy, measured using a list of indicators as set out in Appendix 3. The key pieces of infrastructure which will support the delivery of SP6 are set out in Appendix 4.

The location and mix of development, the way it is linked to transport networks and the availability of more sustainable modes of transport can help achieve this aim. SP7 focuses on promoting sustainable travel and making sure all development is properly integrated with all forms of transport, in line with the Government’s transport objectives set out in section 4 of the NPPF and the Mayor of London’s strategic transport approach in the London Plan. SP7: TRANSPORT Delivering Regeneration and Access In line with London Plan policies, the Local Implementation Plan (LIP) and the Mayor’s Transport Strategy, the Council will work with its partners to promote the following key infrastructure proposals to support Haringey’s regeneration and local/strategic access to London, employment areas and local services; - The Council, in cooperation with neighbouring boroughs, will seek to reduce the impact of larger lorries in local residential areas and town centres and investigate the feasibility of a freight distribution hub; - Improvements to the Piccadilly, Victoria and Northern Lines including new trains, new signalling and new control centres; - Improvements to overground routes along West Anglia, East Coast (Great Northern) and Barking - Gospel Oak line that service the centre and east of the borough; - Access and interchange improvements to overground stations at Alexandra Palace, Finsbury Park, Harringay, Hornsey White Hart Lane, Northumberland Park, South Tottenham, and Bruce Grove; - Improvements to interchanges at Tottenham Hale and Seven Sisters; - Improvements to the Tottenham Gyratory; and - Improvements to east - west bus routes as well as promoting new east - west routes. 85 Delivering Action on Climate Change and Quality and Healthy Places In line with the London Plan, the Council will work with its partners to promote the following travel demand management schemes to tackle climate change, improve local place shaping and public realm, and environmental and transport quality and safety by: - Minimising congestion and addressing the environmental impacts of travel; - Promoting public transport, walking and cycling (including minimum cycle parking standards); - Promoting road safety and pedestrian movement particularly in town centres and close to local services; - Promoting car sharing and establishing car clubs; - Seeking to locate major trip generating developments in locations with good access to public transport and so better integrate transport and land use planning; - Adopting maximum car parking standards and car free housing wherever feasible; - Seeking to mitigate the impact of road based freight and promote alternatives; - Supporting measures to influence behavioural change such as promoting low carbon vehicles; and - Requiring the submission of transport assessments and travel plans for large scale proposals in line with TfL guidance. Promoting sustainable travel options 4.4.2 Haringey’s Local Implementation Plan (LIP) sets out how the Council intends to deliver more sustainable transport, and is a key mechanism for the implementation of the transport objectives set out in the Local Plan. The Upper Lee Valley Opportunity Area Transport Study will address sub-regional and local level issues on the transport network, contributing to the understanding of the impact of proposed growth in the Upper Lee Valley, and providing a sound basis for transport infrastructure delivery planning in the borough and sub-region as a whole. The Development Management Policies set out further detail in relation to sustainable travel and road user hierarchy Public transport 4.4.3 Haringey has relatively good public transport, providing its residents access to employment opportunities in the City and West End, which are within easy travelling distance of rail and tube connections. In addition, local residents have access to the job opportunities within the London-Stansted-Cambridge-Peterborough Corridor. Around two thirds of Haringey residents commute to work outside the borough. Figure 4.3 below shows the Public Transport Accessibility Levels (PTALs) in the borough. There are high levels of accessibility to the network at locations such as Finsbury Park, Wood Green and Tottenham Hale. The River Lee Navigation and other navigable waterways in the borough offer opportunities to promote waterborne passenger transport. *Wood Green* 86 87 4.4.4 National Rail services run mostly North to South. Local services on the East Coast main line serving Alexandra Palace, Harringay and Hornsey have a peak 10 minute frequency while the Enfield Town and Southbury Loop services provide a combined frequency of four trains per hour to stations in the borough. However, the frequency of local services on the West Anglia line serving Tottenham Hale and Northumberland Park are constrained by lack of capacity on the route. An improvement to these services is a major aspiration for the borough. With the exception of the Gospel Oak to Barking rail line, which serves Harringay Green Lanes and South Tottenham, there are no orbital East-West rail links. 4.4.5 The Piccadilly Line serves Turnpike Lane, Wood Green and Bounds Green. The Northern Line serves Highgate while Tottenham Hale and Seven Sisters are on the Victoria Line. Statistics from London Underground show that substantial overcrowding occurs on Underground lines in the borough during the morning peak. This occurs particularly at Seven Sisters on the Victoria Line and Turnpike Lane on the Piccadilly Line. In order to cater for the bulk of London’s forecast increased demand for travel arising from population growth, the London Plan has identified a number of transport schemes to co-ordinate improved public transport capacity as closely as possible with development priorities and phasing. Although SP7 identifies the improvements relevant to Haringey, further detail of their phasing are set out in Appendix 4. 4.4.6 Forty bus routes serve the borough, of which all but seven are high frequency routes. The routes are mainly radial in nature. The main issue for these radial routes is provision of capacity to meet growing demand. A number of routes form a high frequency orbital network. However, further development of the orbital bus routes is needed to provide an effective and sustainable alternative to the car for journeys to the east and west of Haringey. In addition, the development of the orbital bus network is constrained by the nature of the road network and low rail bridges. 4.4.7 Provision of black cabs is low, which restricts the usefulness of Taxicard but the availability of minicabs is relatively high. The borough benefits from Capital Call which provides better access to taxi-type services for the mobility handicapped. Apart from North London Dial a-Ride there are no accessible door to door Plusbus type services for elderly or disabled people. 4.4.8 The whole of the borough of Haringey is an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) for the pollutants of NO 2 (Nitrogen Dioxide) and PM10 particulates which are the most prominent air pollutants. The dominant source of NO 2 and PM10 emissions in Haringey is road transport with a variety of other sources contributing emissions. This has implications for air quality, which is being addressed through the measures outlined in the Council’s Air Quality Action Plan. Haringey is already taking action to reduce existing pollution and to prevent new pollution. For example, monitoring has identified hotspots of poor air quality in the borough. As part of the requirements to control and reduce potential or actual pollution resulting from development in the borough, developers will be required to carry out relevant assessments and set out mitigating measures in line with national guidance. Further detail on the Council’s approach to environmental protection is set out in the Development Management Policies and the Sustainable Design and Construction SPD. Please also see SP14 Health and Well-being. Walking 4.4.9 Walking is a ‘zero carbon’ form of travel that relieves pressure on infrastructure, both in terms of public transport infrastructure and Haringey’s roads. As such, the promotion of walking is an essential element of our approach to managing growth. It also provides wider social benefits in terms of promoting more active, healthy lifestyles (see SP14 Health and Well-Being), and helping to create more active vibrant streets and public spaces (see SP11 Design), also reflecting London Plan policy. 88 4.4.10 In Haringey, 34% of all trips are on foot. This compares with the London-wide figure of 30%. Haringey residents make more than 184,000 walking trips per day which is considerably more than car driver trips (at 118,000). Through the LIP, the Council is seeking TfL funding to implement a variety of schemes to improve the accessibility of walking routes to key amenity and commuter destinations for residents and local people in their local communities and in the borough. This includes a series of walking audits to identify deficiencies along popular walking routes to town centres, the public transport network, schools and local amenities. 4.4.11 The Council has developed a Public Rights of Way Improvement Plan that provides a focus for investment and enhancements to encourage walking in the medium to long term. This Plan will implement action to identify additional footpaths as Rights of Way. 4.4.12 A network of Greenway cycle and walking routes are being implemented to link the green and open spaces of the borough for recreational walking and cycling. Four initial routes are proposed - Finsbury Park to the Lea Valley, Finsbury Park to Highgate via Parkland Walk nature reserve, Muswell Hill to Alexandra Palace Station and Highgate to Alexandra Palace Park. Cycling 4.4.13 As with walking, cycling is a sustainable means of travel that provides the opportunity to relieve congestion as well as promoting healthy, active lifestyles. The Council will work to improve conditions for cycling across the whole of its street network. In line with London Plan policy, Haringey will work with all relevant partners to bring about a significant increase in cycling in the borough. *Smarter Haringey Road Show* 4.4.14 Haringey has a network of cycle routes across the borough including cycle lanes on main roads, cycle tracks and special fully signed quiet routes. The borough has delivered a programme of cycling route improvements and new cycle routes across the borough as part of the London Cycle Network, and will seek to improve the safety and continuity of routes where needed, including the provision of new links to and between routes. 4.4.15 In addition, the Council will be working with the Mayor on delivering two Cycle Superhighways and is installing on-street cycle parking facilities at key locations including stations, transport interchanges, shopping centres, local amenities and recreational facilities, as well as providing cycle training for school pupils and individuals. 4.4.16 The Council will ensure cycle parking is provided as part of the planning process in line with its cycle parking standards and will seek to provide cycle parking in existing residential buildings. 4.4.17 The Council will ensure cycle use is considered in all highway improvement work, including maintaining and where possible improving cycle trip directness and safety. Making private transport more sustainable 4.4.18 For journeys where more sustainable travel options are not practical, car clubs and car sharing offer an alternative to privately owned cars. Car clubs are hire schemes that allow households to avoid the costs of car ownership, deter them from using cars for a trip which is convenient without one, and reduce the amount of car parking space needed. Haringey is working with a selected contractor to provide car club bays throughout the borough. By 2011 it is expected that a car club bay will be within five minutes walk of all households in the borough. 4.4.19 The Council also encourages low emission vehicles by providing electric charging points across the borough. Although still contributing to congestion, electric vehicles do not have the air quality impacts of ordinary cars. 89 The provision of transport infrastructure 4.4.20 The North London Sub Regional Transport Plan published by TfL in 2010 identified the transport challenges facing Haringey and the other north London boroughs of Enfield, Waltham Forest and Barnet. The Plan identifies the measures to meet these challenges including enhanced rail and underground capacity and unfunded schemes such as the Chelsea – Hackney line and four-tracking of the West Anglia Main Line; removal of the one-way gyratory system in Tottenham Hale; better management of the road network through, for example, management of planned events and better traffic control systems; encouraging mode shift from car to walking and cycling such as through smarter travel; improvement to interchanges at Finsbury Park and Tottenham Hale and improvements to accessibility and connectivity. 4.4.21 Through the Council’s Local Implementation Plan (Transport Strategy) investment will be made between 2011 and 2014 in our town centres of Wood Green and Green Lanes, on local safety schemes, environmental measures, cycling schemes such as Greenways and local cycle routes and smarter travel behavioural change programmes. This investment would support the predicted increases in housing and employment. Please see Appendix 4 key Infrastructure Programmes and Projects, and the Council’s Key Infrastructure Delivery Plan for a list of key transport improvements/ infrastructure provision required to support the delivery of the Local Plan over the 15 year period. The setting of a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) will help to marry the clearly identified needs and gaps with appropriate funding to meet any existing or projected gaps. This funding will come in part, from the future CIL for the borough. The Council is working closely with TfL and other stakeholders to monitor the progress and implementation of these projects. The Tottenham Hale Gyratory project is underway and the interlinked Bus Interchange project is progressing. INDICATORS Monitoring 4.4.22 SP7 will be monitored regularly to ensure effective delivery of its aims and objectives over the life of the Local Plan. The Authority Monitoring Report will be used to assess the performance of the policy, measured using a list of indicators as set out in Appendix 3. The key infrastructure which will support the delivery of SP7 are set out in Appendix 4 (Infrastructure Delivery Plan).

This will be achieved by promoting a vibrant economy, meeting business needs, increasing skills, raising employment and reducing worklessness so that all residents can contribute to and benefit from a prosperous economy. 5.1.2 As the objectives in Section 1 set out, the Council wishes to strengthen Haringey’s economy through reducing worklessness by increasing skills, raising educational attainment, and improving childcare and nursery provision. The Council will also aim to meet the needs of different sectors of the economy, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and those organisations within the voluntary sector through the provision of a range of premises of different types, sizes and costs. 5.1.3 Strategic Policies 8 and 9 are important in achieving the vision and objectives of the Sustainable Community Strategy, the Regeneration Strategy and this Local Plan by protecting employment land, providing the increased jobs and training opportunities needed to support Haringey’s growing population and by securing land and premises for the borough’s businesses. SP8: EMPLOYMENT The Council will secure a strong economy in Haringey and protect the Borough’s hierarchy of employment land, Strategic Industrial Locations, Locally Significant Industrial Sites, Local Employment Areas and other non-designated employment sites. The forecast demand is for an additional 23,800 m [2 ] of B Class floorspace up to 2026. This forecast demand is to be met through: - The reconfiguration and re-use of surplus employment designated land in B2 and B8 Use Classes; - The intensification of the use of existing employment sites (where possible); - The provision of B1a/b floorspace as part of mixed-use development on suitable sites, including town centre sites; and - The protection of existing viable B Class Uses on designated and non-designated sites. In addition the Council will also: - Support local employment and regeneration aims; - Support environmental policies to minimise travel to work; - Support small and medium sized businesses that need employment land and space; and - Contribute to the need for a diverse north London and London economy including the need to promote industry in general in the Upper Lea Valley and in particular, promote modern manufacturing, business innovation, green/waste industries, transport, distribution and logistics. 92 Strategic Industrial Locations The Council will safeguard the following sites as Strategic Industrial Locations (SIL) as identified in the London Plan: - Millmead and Ashley Road (Part SIL/RA); and - Part of Central Leeside (Brantwood, North East Tottenham & Marsh Lane estates). Locally Significant Industrial Sites The Council will safeguard the following sites as Locally Significant Industrial Sites (LSIS) for a range of industrial uses (B1 (b), (c), B2 and B8) where they continue to meet demand and the needs of modern industry and business: - Cranford Way, N8; - Lindens/Rosebery Works, N17; - Queen Street, N17; - South Tottenham, N17; - Vale Road/Tewksbury Road (Part), N15; - White Hart Lane, N17; and - Willoughby Lane, N17. Local Employment Areas The Council has identified other local employment generating sites in the borough that need protection. Local Employment Areas (LEAs) are employment sites that offer a more flexible approach to the uses on them. This category has been divided into two sub-categories: Employment Land and Regeneration Areas. - Employment Land (EL) is land that is deemed acceptable for other employment generating uses that complement the traditional ‘B’ use classes, such as a small scale “walk-to-retail”, cafes and crèche/nursery. Local Employment Areas classified as EL are: - Bounds Green Industrial Estate; - Pinkham Way - A Regeneration Area (RA) is the most flexible of the categories as it can include uses appropriate in a mixed use development, such as small scale “walk-to” retail, community and residential uses. However, the approach to mixed uses in Regeneration Areas must have regard to London Plan town centre and retail policies, so not to encourage retail development outside of town centres, as well as other Local Plan policies. Local Employment Areas classified as RA are: - High Road East, N17 - High Road West, N17 - Rangemoor Road and Herbert Road (part EL/ RA), N15 - South Tottenham, (Part LSIS/RA), N15 - Tottenham Hale, (Part RA), N17 - Vale Road / Tewkesbury Road (Part LSIS/RA), N15 - Wood Green, N22 - Omega Works, N4 - Arena Design Centre, N4 5.1.4 Taking a more flexible approach where local employment areas are no longer suitable for industrial or other employment generating uses, a progressive release of surplus industrial land will be carried out, in order to facilitate urban regeneration. This released land will be allocated on a sequential needs basis. Haringey will have regard to the criteria set out in paragraph 4.11 - 4.13 of the Mayor’s SPG on Land for Industry and Transport when considering the release of industrial land, including Locally Significant Industrial Sites and Employment Areas. The criteria are based on general economic and land use factors and indicators of industrial land demand. Regard will also be had to the qualitative characteristics of location and specific sites. 5.1.5 Policing and other community safety infrastructure proposed within the employment land hierarchy will be dealt with on an individual site basis, and with due regard to the provisions of the London Plan. 5.1.6 The Council has identified a hierarchy of employment land, where certain types of employment uses should be concentrated. These employment areas vary in age, quality and size of buildings, access and the nature of the businesses within them. New development offers the opportunity to: improve the quality of the existing employment floorspace; make more efficient employment use of the Borough’s employment land; and to ensure new floorspace is better tailored to meeting London’s and Haringey’s changing economic needs. Campsbourne,N8 - Central Leeside (Part SIL/RA), N17 - Crusader Industrial Estate, N15 - Hale Wharf, N17 93 5.1.7 The hierarchy of sites will be further reviewed and revised as necessary to take account of economic circumstances and further guidance from the Mayor of London through the Site Allocations DPD, Tottenham Area Action Plan and other future Local Plan documents, as relevant. The consideration of the boundary and function of employment land allocations, including the scope for new land uses, should be consistent with any strategically coordinated process such as that promoted by the upper Lee Valley Opportunity Area Planning Framework. Strategic Industrial Locations (SIL) 5.1.8 In terms of Strategic Industrial Locations (SILs), north London contains 20% of London’s industrial land with seven SILs, two of which are located in Haringey (part of Central Leeside and Tottenham Hale). These sites form a London wide network of sites for industry, business and warehousing. The London Plan states that in managing the stock of industrial land, account should be taken of the need to make provision for transport and land for waste management facilities in line with the self-sufficiency requirements of the London Plan, and taking into account some of the Central Activity Zone’s needs. (All works associated with SP8 at Tottenham Hale should be designed in a way that will not lead to adverse effects on the European Site and its bird population in the neighbouring authority of Waltham Forest, see SP13 for details). 5.1.9 The London Plan identifies two broad categories of SIL, Preferred Industrial Locations (PILs) and Industrial Business Parks (IBPs). Within Haringey, Central Leeside (which includes Brantwood Road, North East Tottenham, Willoughby and Marsh Lane) and Tottenham Hale are classed as SIL - the latter is an IBP, which accommodates businesses requiring a higher quality environment. 5.1.10 The SILs within the Central Leeside boundary will be protected against redevelopment and retained in employment. This is particularly important, given the proposal for around 5000 new homes in Enfield, on the border of these employment sites. These employment areas could provide jobs and training for some of these residents and contribute towards creating a mixed and sustainable community. It is for this reason that changes of use outside the ‘B’ use class, that are not consistent with or complimentary to traditional B uses, will not be allowed. 5.1.11 The Mayor’s Land for Industry and Transport SPG expands on London Plan policies to manage, promote and, where appropriate, protect Strategic Industrial Locations, London’s strategic reservoir of industrial development capacity. The SPG identifies the ‘plan, monitor and manage’ approach to surplus industrial land, with the aim of reconciling the relationship between supply and demand during 2006-­ 2026. Furthermore, when the net reduction in industrial land demand, and management of vacancy rates are considered, there is scope for the release of around 814 hectares of industrial land in the north sub-region (48ha per annum over the period 2006-16 and 33ha per annum for 2016-26). Haringey is classified as a “limited transfer” borough of industrial sites, which means safeguarding the best quality sites and managing the rest to reduce vacancy rates where possible. This means that in developing policies for the retention and release of land, Haringey should take account of this classification. Locally Significant Industrial Sites (LSIS) 5.1.12 These are well established industrial areas and the aim is to retain them solely for uses that fall within B1 (b), B1 (c), B2 or B8 uses, or uses that share strong similarities to this use class, for example policing and other community safety infrastructure, in line with National and Regional guidance. Retail development does not fall within the scope of this policy. In line with the 2014 Employment Land Study, the Council will protect these areas to provide choice and flexibility in employment land. The Council will look at opportunities to improve and enhance the general environment of these areas and buildings. 94 Local Employment Areas 5.1.13 These areas will be treated more flexibly and uses that generate employment not included in the B use class will be considered. Some of these activities fall outside the confines of the B class uses that are characteristic of those in the Industrial Locations but, nevertheless, provide a source of employment and contribute to the local economy. 5.1.14 In principle, mixed use development including residential, employment and community facilities may be appropriate in some Local Employment Areas. These areas provide the opportunity to provide essential community infrastructure for the local community. In accordance with the findings of the Haringey Employment Study 2014, a more proactive and positive approach to planning for economic development is required. It will be important for a flexible approach to economic development to be taken on Local Employment Areas by carefully managing the type of use that is permitted on allocated sites. *North Tottenham SIL* 5.1.15 The Council recognises that some of the designated employment sites contain within their defined boundaries, or adjoining them, designated heritage assets and therefore careful management of these sites will be considered against all other relevant Local Plan policies, e.g. SP4 Working Towards a Low Carbon Haringey, SP11 Design and SP12 Conservation when assessing development proposals. The Council’s detailed approach to protecting employment land and premises will be set out in the Development Management Policies. 95 96 Protection and Enhancement of Existing Employment Sites 5.1.16 Haringey’s economy is dominated by employment in three broad sectors, namely: 1. The public sector 24% (such as education and health); 2. Retail 13%; and 3. The service sector 18% (such as cafes, pubs, banks and estate agents). 5.1.17 Haringey’s relatively strong representation in the manufacturing sector compared to other areas reflects the presence of significant strategic and local industrial areas in the borough. However, over the life of the Local Plan the Council will consider means of balancing the needs of competitive industrial and manufacturing activities with those of the service and warehousing sectors with significant growth potential. 5.1.18 The London Plan 2011 provides employment growth projections for the north London sub-­ region (Barnet, Enfield and Haringey) of 37,500 additional jobs over the period 2011 - 2031 (1,875 per annum). Haringey has a key role in contributing to this target. The London Plan sets out revised employment projections for Haringey. The London Plan forecasts 12,000 additional jobs in the Borough over the period 2011 – 2026. Over the period 2011 – 2036, it forecasts an additional 22,000 jobs in Haringey. This represents a 29.5% increase in jobs, the highest projected employment growth rate of all London boroughs. The Area Action Plan process will identify opportunities for new employment, investment in infrastructure and environmental improvements, in order to attract new businesses in the sectors identified. This process will also allow for the opportunity to set out a local job target. 5.1.19 The Upper Lee Valley area is predominantly a small firms economy and public sector employment represents the largest single sector for jobs in the north London region. Economic performance has declined over the years and large tracts of land previously in employment use are obsolete. 5.1.20 A review of the borough’s existing employment land and buildings was undertaken in 2014. The Employment Study 2014 provided an assessment of the employment land and demand in the borough. The study recommended that all existing employment sites (designated or otherwise) be retained. Therefore, in the first instance, support will be given for all designated sites and smaller sites to remain in employment use. However, flexibility will be shown for alternative uses that complement the employment uses, contribute to social infrastructure or provide training. 5.1.21 Manufacturing employment in Haringey continues to decline. Indeed, this decline is more pronounced in Haringey than in London or Great Britain. Haringey’s Employment Land Study 2014 reflects this change in employment base by predicting a need for a total floorspace requirement of approximately 23,800m [2] for the period 2006 – 2026. This includes a net reduction in demand for industrial and warehouse floorspace. The majority of demand is predicted to be for B1 floorspace including light industrial. Much of this demand is to be met through the reconfiguration of redundant existing industrial and warehouse floorspace and through mixeduse development within LEA – Regeneration Areas and town centre sites, particularly in Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre and the District Town Centres. The trajectory identifying the locations and phasing to deliver the additional employment floorspace needed is set out at Appendix 2b, and will assist in monitoring delivery over the plan period. Given the uncertainty around the long-term demand for employment floorspace, the Council undertakes to update the Employment Land Review every five years or within a shorter period should monitoring indicate a review is necessary. 5.1.22 The Mayor’s Land for Industry and Transport SPG urges boroughs to make employment land available for transport functions, such as rail freight facilities, bus garages and waste management facilities. The identification of sites for future waste management facilities will be addressed by the emerging North London Waste Plan. 97 5.1.23 The need for an increase in the provision of good quality, flexible work space, particularly for small businesses is supported by the views of commercial property agents active in Haringey-­ as identified in a stakeholder consultation carried out as part of the Employment Land Study 2014. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are also an important part of Haringey’s economy, and the London Plan highlights the need for local authorities to ensure adequate provision is made for SMEs, given the anticipated role of these businesses in accommodating future growth of employment outside central London. Where appropriate and viable, the Council will encourage the provision of such office accommodation for SMEs. In addition, environmental enhancement and high quality design are an important element in the enhancement of existing employment sites. Please see SP11 and SP12 for the Council’s approach to design and conservation. 5.1.24 The North London Employment Land Study (2006) indicated that Haringey has the oldest industrial/warehousing stock in the sub-region. There is little opportunity for speculative construction due to few opportunities for redevelopment on reasonably sized plots. The market was described as being restricted due to the lack of single large occupiers and the highly fragmented ownership of many sites. In the study, most of the borough’s stock was identified as either good or reasonable with a smaller proportion of buildings identified as poor or very poor compared to North London as a whole. Haringey’s net employment land demand was forecast to reduce over the period to 2016. Haringey was not perceived to be a key office location, mainly due to its proximity to the centre of London, with most demand originating from companies historically located in the area. These findings were supported by the London Office Policy review in 2007. *Chocolate Factory, Wood Green* 5.1.25 In June 2009, the North London Strategic Alliance commissioned a report, which looked at the economic position of the Upper Lee Valley and how it could contribute to opportunities to provide more workspace and leisure as well as improving its existing business base. Its proximity to the major road network gives it a strong position from which to entice businesses and other appropriate uses as well as exploit opportunities to create and improve recreation and leisure pursuits. The report has four themes which will be used as a basis for implementing the strategies: - Green/sustainable industries and resource management; - Employment and skills - apprenticeships; - Developing the further and higher education offer; and - London 2012 and the visitor economy. 5.1.26 The Outer London Commission has recently carried out an economic profile. The Commission’s interim findings concluded, among other things, that growth should focus on successful areas and not start from scratch; that there is a need to release land for development; that outer London needs to improve skills through higher or further education to reinforce its offer; and that there is a need to re-invent, re-brand and actively market parts of outer London and its distinct offers. 5.1.27 SP8 focuses on facilitating the restructuring of the borough’s employment land portfolio to allow an increase in B1 floorspace whilst enabling the modernisation of old stock and managed transfer of obsolete industrial sites to alternative uses. Balanced restructuring and diversification is more likely to assist in stimulating sustainable economic growth compared to an approach which focused on a significant net increase or decrease in the total supply of employment land in the borough. 98 Green Industries 5.1.28 The Council is committed to reducing and mitigating the effects of climate change. In order to help achieve this, and in conjunction with London Plan policies, the Council will support and promote the development of green industries and green practices. For example, the Council will expect new, large developments to incorporate combined heat and power (CHP) and other renewable fuels wherever possible. Industries that manage recycling and reuse of waste within the borough will be encouraged, as will industries that reduce their carbon footprint in their day-to-day activities. This is in line with SP4 Working Towards a Low Carbon Haringey. Small and Medium Enterprises 5.1.29 The London Plan describes the North London sub-region as stretching from the Central Activities Zone (CAZ) to the northern fringe of London with an exceptionally varied set of strongly defined communities. Economic performance is described as being varied with some strong employment growth in the CAZ and its fringes, but with other areas continuing to experience deprivation and slow growth/ declining employment, including parts of the Upper Lee Valley and industrial areas around the North Circular Road. The release of surplus industrial land to other uses will need to be rigorously managed, particularly in areas that can accommodate this release. This includes Opportunity Areas to the east (including Tottenham Hale) and to the west (Haringey Heartlands, including Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre). Small and medium sized enterprises are important elements in the sub-regional economy and they need to be fully supported. INDICATORS Monitoring 5.1.30 SP8 will be monitored regularly to ensure effective delivery of its aims and objectives over the life of the Local Plan. The Authority Monitoring Report will be used to assess the performance of the policy, measured using a list of indicators as set out in Appendix 3.

The Council will encourage the provision and growth of education and training facilities within the borough in areas such as Haringey Heartlands and Tottenham Hale and areas of high unemployment. The Council will promote the diversification of the borough’s economy and support new and expanding employment sectors such as green industries, small and medium sized enterprises. The Council will secure financial contributions from development that results in a net loss of employment floorspace to invest in training and other initiatives that seek to promote employment and adult education in the borough. Supporting Local Employment Training Schemes and Enterprise Development 5.2.1 In Haringey, there is a polarisation between low and high level skills amongst the working age population. Some 21% of the borough’s working age population has a level 1 or below qualification while 43% have a level 4 or above qualification. GLA Economics estimates that by 2020 the demand for highly skilled workers will increase to the extent that 50% of employees in London will need to have a level 4 qualification. The aim is to promote a higher skilled workforce within the borough and encourage more jobs into the borough to match that skills base. 5.2.2 The employment rate in Haringey is 63% compared to 68% in London and 70% nationally. The Government has aspirations to achieve full employment, equating to an 80% national employment rate. If this was to be replicated in Haringey it would mean an additional 2,480 residents needing to find employment - a huge challenge, especially in light of the current economic climate. 5.2.3 The Council is committed to providing new jobs and training wherever possible through the reuse of vacant sites and the more intensive use of sites already in employment use. The links that already exist between the Council and education institutions will continue, as training has a pivotal role in reducing unemployment and providing greater flexibility in the local economy. The training of local people provides positive feedback into the local economy by allowing businesses to have access to a skilled workforce. This is particularly important in light of new emerging sectors such as green industries. 100 5.2.4 In line with Haringey’s Regeneration Strategy (2008), the Council is involved in a range of initiatives that support local recruitment by employers and help meet employers’ recruitment, staff training and development needs. 5.2.5 The Council is committed to using the Jobs for Haringey programme as a means of supporting more Haringey residents into sustainable employment. Jobs for Haringey works with employers, schools and colleges, skills training providers, employment services and local communities to deliver: - Jobs for unemployed local people who already have skills to a level required by employers; - Jobs for local people with relevant skills following completion of training courses and/ or work placements; and - Support for local businesses by providing a financial incentive, through the Haringey Jobs Fund, to recruit local unemployed people. 5.2.6 The Council will use Jobs for Haringey to support and deliver the objectives set out in SP9. Alongside this, the Council will seek to strengthen already strong partnership arrangements with Jobcentre Plus and work closely with the three prime contractors responsible for delivering the Work Programme in Haringey. Supporting Self Employment 5.2.7 Haringey has a high representation of small businesses with 98% of the businesses in the borough employing less than 50 people. This is supported by a strong spirit of entrepreneurialism with 18,300 being self employed, representing 23% of all employment in the borough. 5.2.8 Despite under-representation in comparison to London, there has been an increase in the number of large companies with 200 or more employees in the borough. There are 53 known organisations within this sector in the borough, with the majority based in Tottenham. The Council is committed to encouraging small start-up units in new developments and supporting small and medium sized units on existing sites or in existing buildings. The Council will work with local business groups and partnerships and recognise their role in supporting Haringey’s growth. 5.2.9 The Chocolate Factory I and II are prime examples of locations that are providing high quality small and medium units for up and coming businesses in the creative industries. Known as the Cultural Quarter, these locations in Haringey Heartlands provide a thriving hub of accessible units very close to Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre. More units like these will be supported in the Heartlands to expand the Cultural Quarter further and develop the existing physical links between this area and Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre. INDICATORS Monitoring 5.2.10 SP9 will be monitored regularly to ensure effective delivery of its aims and objectives over the life of the Local Plan. The Authority Monitoring Report will be used to assess the performance of the policy, measured using a list of indicators as set out in Appendix 3. Key evidence and references - Haringey Employment Study, London Borough of Haringey 2009 and update 2012 - Haringey Community Infrastructure Plan, London Borough of Haringey 2010 - Haringey’s Regeneration Strategy, London Borough of Haringey 2008 - Haringey’s Children and Young People’s Plan 2009-2020, London Borough of Haringey 2009 - Haringey Worklessness Statement, London Borough of Haringey 2007 - Haringey Initial Work and Skills Plan, London Borough of Haringey 2010 - Child Poverty Strategy 2008-2011, London Borough of Haringey 2008 - Well being Strategic Framework, London Borough of Haringey 2007 - Mapping Haringey’s Third Sector, Haringey Strategic Partnership 2010. 101 5.3.1 Haringey’s town centres are more than just areas in which to shop - they provide an “experience” including leisure for shoppers (e.g. cinema and leisure centres), community facilities, as well as employment in the form of offices, and places to live. They provide a focus for activity and community life and give character and identity to the local area and borough as a whole. 5.3.2 One of the strategic priorities for north London is to enhance the attractiveness of town centres to consumers and manage the restructuring of town centres in need of change, especially in the outer parts of the sub-region. Wood Green is one of eleven Metropolitan Town Centres in London and has the potential to provide sustainable access to higher quality goods and services. 5.3.3 As the objectives in Section 1 set out, the Council wishes to strengthen the role of Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre and the borough’s District Centres as accessible locations for retail, office, leisure and community uses and new homes, and to enhance the environmental quality and attractiveness of the borough’s town centres. 5.3.4 This policy seeks to support and promote Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre and the five District Centres as existing successful and vibrant town centres, and places that will attract new businesses, jobs and homes during the life of the Local Plan, thus becoming even more vibrant and exciting hubs of community life. It will also support, promote and protect the borough’s 38 local shopping centres as places that offer unique and often specialist goods and services to their immediate communities. SP10: TOWN CENTRES Distribution of retail across Haringey The Council will promote the distribution of retail growth to meet the required additional 13,800m [2] gross comparison goods floorspace and an additional 10,194m [2] net convenience goods floorspace by 2016. The majority of this additional retail growth will be met in Wood Green Metropolitan Centre and the five District Town Centres. Protecting and enhancing Haringey’s Town Centres The Council will promote and encourage development of retail, office, community, leisure, entertainment facilities, recreation uses, arts and cultural activities within its town centres according to the borough’s town centre hierarchy. Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre will be the principal focus of growth accommodating an extensive range of the types of development set out above, which should help to shape Wood Green into a thriving and vibrant centre for north London. Development proposals which foster a diverse evening and night time economy in Wood Green will be supported providing that measures are in place to address issues such as community safety, policing, litter and the potential impact of noise and disturbance to local people. 102 The District Town Centres of Bruce Grove/ Tottenham High Road, Crouch End, Green Lanes, Muswell Hill and West Green Road/Seven Sisters will continue to be supported and strengthened as important shopping and service centres to meet people’s day-to-day needs. The Council will take a proactive partnership approach to reinvigorating these town centres, widening their role and offer, developing their identities, improving the public realm and accessibility to them. Haringey’s Local Shopping Centres will continue to be supported in providing core local shopping facilities and services (such as convenience store, post office, and newsagent) for their respective local communities, largely catering for a catchment area within walking distance. It is possible to identify potential future changes to the borough’s town centres over the life of the Local Plan, including potential new centres. Given the existing scale, role and function and mixed use development which is currently taking place at Tottenham Hale there may be potential to designate Tottenham Hale Urban Centre as a new District Centre. Town Centre Hierarchy 5.3.5 SP10 establishes the hierarchy of town centres within the borough. The role and function of Haringey’s centres vary, reflecting the diverse nature of the borough itself: - Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre and the five District Town Centres of Muswell Hill, Crouch End, Tottenham High Road/Bruce Grove, Green Lanes and Seven Sisters/ West Green Road are influenced by major shopping destinations in north and central London and compete with a number of centres in neighbouring boroughs including Brent Cross, Walthamstow and Edmonton Green in Enfield; - Haringey’s 38 Local Shopping Centres, which provide for the day-to-day needs of people living, working and staying nearby; and - A number of smaller shopping parades and individual shops also meet the day-to-day needs for shopping, services and facilities. 5.3.6 The spatial arrangement of retail centres provides a basis for shaping Haringey, for locating community infrastructure and building attractive and distinctive focal points for neighbourhoods, for sustainable growth and regeneration of the borough (Figure 5.2). Distribution of Retail Growth 5.3.7 Haringey will focus new shopping (and related uses) in the borough’s designated growth areas and existing centres, having regard to the level of capacity available in these locations. The borough’s growth areas and town centres are shown on Figure 2.1. 5.3.8 The borough’s Retail Study 2008 predicts that Haringey will require an extra 13,800m [2 ] gross comparison goods floorspace and an additional 10,194m [2] net convenience goods floorspace by 2016. It is anticipated that much of this will be met in Wood Green Metropolitan Centre and the five District Centres and the potential of a new retail centre being proposed as part of the Tottenham Hale Urban Centre Masterplan SPD. The growth area of Haringey Heartlands and the redevelopment of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club will also provide the major focus for retail provision in Haringey. 5.3.9 In line with paragraph 24 of the NPPF, the Council will ensure that its town centres are considered first for the location of new retail development, having regard to the distribution of future retail growth set out in SP10 and the hierarchy of Haringey’s town centres. *Three Compasses, Hornsey* 103 Protecting and Promoting Town Centres 5.3.10 The development of new shops or other town centre uses, particularly if they are large in scale, can have an impact on other centres. The Council will ensure that development in its centres is appropriate to the character, size and role of the centre in which it is located, and does not cause harm to neighbours, the local area or other centres. Shops and service uses (A1 and A2) are considered suitable for all town centres. 5.3.11 The way town centres look is an important factor in their character and the way they are perceived. A number of our centres lie in Conservation Areas - Tottenham High Road, Crouch End, Muswell Hill - recognising their architectural and/or historical importance. The design of shop fronts can contribute greatly to the character of town centres and their distinctiveness. Further information on town centres and the Council’s approach to enhancing and protecting them are set out in SP11 and SP12, the Council’s Conservation Area Appraisals and the Development Management Policies. This is also in line with continued investment in the public realm to maximise the historic environment’s contribution to town centre vibrancy and vitality in policy, as set out in the NPPF. Ensuring a Range of Shops and Other Appropriate Town Centre Uses 5.3.12 Where it is possible, within the provisions of the Use Classes Order and the General Development Order, the Council will seek to ensure that there is a diverse range of shopping facilities provided across the borough, from its town centres, through to the smallest shopping parades and frontages. This is to ensure residents can access a full range of shops and services to meet their everyday and longer term needs without resorting to reliance on public transport or car based journeys. Improvements to public transport and promotion of more sustainable modes of travel will contribute to more accessible, vibrant and greener town centres, as set out in SP7. 5.3.13 Car ownership in the borough is 54% of households; this is lower than the overall figure for Greater London at 60 % of households and much lower than Britain as a whole, where 75% of households have access to a car. The lower level of car ownership in the borough is a reflection of the good access to public transport. 5.3.14 One of the strategic priorities for North London is to enhance the attractiveness of town centres to consumers, and manage the restructuring of town centres in need of change, especially in the outer parts of the sub-region, in line with the London Plan. The Retail Study 2008 identified 190 vacant units within town and local centres, a vacancy rate of 8.0%. This is compared to a GOAD national average vacancy rate of 11%. If half of the 95 units were re-occupied this would help to accommodate growth and, based on the average size of a unit (100m [2] ), these re-occupied units could accommodate about 9,500m [2] gross floorspace. 5.3.15 This Local Plan policy seeks to promote new investment in the town centres to deliver good economic outcomes, consistent with the overall approach to growth, as set out in Strategic Policy 1 and section 23 of the NPPF. Bringing shop vacancies back into use will help achieve the anticipated required growth in comparison to floor space and this will promote greater diversity in the range of facilities being provided and act as a community hub. Development of new retail locations in town centres could encourage economic investment, delivering more jobs and possible diversification of businesses. 5.3.16 New retail development that will have a negative impact on existing town centres will be resisted and the existing hierarchy of centres and their respective primary and secondary frontages will be retained and protected. Wherever possible, the Council will encourage proposals that add to the vibrancy and choice of shops in the existing centres. 105 5.3.17 The Council will seek to retain all A1 use within Improving Our Town Centres the primary frontage as the presence of blank 5.3.20 The borough’s shopping centres are nuclei facades can contribute to inactivity at street of leisure, relaxation and retail choice for the level during certain times of the day.

They provide various forms of entertainment and relaxation and bring income into the borough. Their successful roles and functions are essential to the economic health and wealth of the borough. Part of the shopping experience is moving through the town centre. Negotiating traffic, rubbish and large numbers of people grouped together can make that experience unpleasant. 5.3.18 To preserve the viability and vitality of the primary and secondary frontages, no more than two adjoining frontages should be in non-A1 use. A2, A3, A4 and A5 uses or community facilities are the preferred alternatives to A1 because they are appropriate uses within town centres and would largely retain a window display. Window displays can help maintain the attractiveness and continuity of the shopping frontage especially in the core shopping areas. Further detail will be set out in the Development Management Policies. Encouraging Residential Development 5.3.19 The housing needs of the borough are discussed in more detail in SP2 Housing and SP1 Managing Growth (for distribution of growth). The inclusion of new housing development within Wood Green Town Centre, as well as changes of use to residential on the upper floors will contribute to providing a vibrant environment. Intensifying residential development in town centres could have positive benefits by reducing pressure for more residential areas and creating natural surveillance. Wherever possible, housing development will also be encouraged in the other town centres, providing it complements the essential retail element within the centre. 5.3.21 The Council will endeavour to improve the overall environment of the town centres, wherever possible, through design to improve safety and comfort for those using the centres. This will encourage respect for the local character and promote high quality, clutter free design to make streets and public places that are safe and easy to use for all. In line with section 23 of the NPPF, it is the Council’s intention to review the performance of town centres. Through health checks, the Council will monitor the character and vitality of the centres and the impact of retail developments near them. It will use these checks to understand changing shopping trends and use them as a way of keeping abreast of the needs of shoppers, residents and workers. Additionally, investment into the public realm and historic environment will support the economic competitiveness of town centres by ensuring that their historic environments are maintained to maximise their attractiveness. Results from the 2009 Town Centre Health Check showed that vacancy rates in Haringey’s Metropolitan and District Town Centres were well below the Council target of 10% and below national vacancy rates of 11%. The Council will continue to carry out health checks of its town centres and monitor any impact through the Authority Monitoring Report. 5.3.22 The section below describes each of Haringey’s town centres. The Council will expect development in its centres to reflect the character and role of the centres in which it is located. 106 Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre 5.3.23 Wood Green consists of approximately 365 units (excluding non-retail Class A uses), comprising 86,864m [2] of floorspace. The centre offers a wide range and choice of goods, both everyday needs such as food and less frequently purchased goods. There is a high representation of multiple retailers and comparison retailers. In addition to shops, there are two multiscreen cinemas and a number of community facilities. The centre serves shoppers both from the borough and across north London, which is possible because of its very good public transport links with the rest of London. 5.3.24 The sub-regional development framework indicates there is capacity to accommodate some of North London’s need for additional retail floorspace in Wood Green, stating “Wood Green remains the largest town centre in the sub-region and its role as a metropolitan centre should be enhanced by exploiting development opportunities in the associated Heartlands area for intensification and through higher density mixed use schemes in the town centre. 5.3.25 Wood Green is identified as having 106,000m [2 ] total rental floorspace and needing between 7000m [2] - 11,000m [2] additional comparison floorspace by 2016. The opportunity to complement the existing facilities in Wood Green exists with the proximity of Haringey Heartlands. 5.3.26 The retail performance and importance of a shopping centre can be demonstrated by commercial yields and Zone A rental levels achieved for retail property. Retail yields in Wood Green are relatively low (strong) and have fallen from 7.75% in 2004 to 5.7% in 2008. They are slightly higher (worse) than Romford and Ilford (the Exchange) but slightly lower (better) than in Enfield, Finchley, Barnet and Ilford. Wood Green achieves a Zone A rent of £1,399 per m [2] and this has steadily increased in the centre since 1998. These rents are lower than in Enfield, Ilford, Romford and Brent Cross. In comparison, retail rents are higher in Wood Green than in Walthamstow and Barnet. Muswell Hill achieves retail rents of £969 per m [2 ] (2007 data), which is higher than in Barnet but lower than Wood Green and Walthamstow. As a Metropolitan Centre, Wood Green should aim to achieve higher Zone A retail rents. 5.3.27 The Retail Study indicated that Wood Green feels relatively safe during the day. Both police presence and CCTV coverage are viewed as good, as is the frequency of street lights. However, there is an element of anti-social behaviour that impacts on the users of the centre that needs to be addressed. On-street drinking is viewed as the primary nuisance within the centre which needs reviewing. 5.3.28 Pedestrian movement in and around the centre can also be a challenge because of its linear structure. The high volume of vehicular traffic also causes pedestrian/vehicular conflict, which is relieved somewhat through the good frequency of pedestrian crossings. 5.3.29 Food, drink and entertainment uses add to the diversity and vibrancy of Haringey’s town centres and bring activity to them outside normal shop hours. Wood Green, as the largest town centre in the borough, has a thriving night time economy of pubs, restaurants, cinemas and night clubs, located mainly around Hollywood Green Cinema. Whilst these uses are an intrinsic and essential part of any town centre it is also imperative that these uses do not have a negative impact on the lives and day to day activities of local people or negatively alter the character and role of the centre itself. It is therefore essential that changes of use to these types of businesses are monitored and reviewed to ensure their impact is minimal. These uses will be monitored through the development management process in terms of hours of opening and the potential impact on the town centre as a whole. 5.3.30 Wood Green is adjacent to two Conservation Areas, Trinity Gardens and Noel Park. In line with Strategic Policy 12 Conservation the design of any new development near the Conservation Areas must be sympathetic to and enhance them in order to protect their status and setting. 107 *Wood Green Town Centre* Bruce Grove/Tottenham High Road 5.3.31 This centre is located near Bruce Grove station. Tottenham High Road has its origins in Roman times, although the Bruce Grove section was developed in the late Victorian period when the station was opened in 1872. The centre is characterised by Victorian and Edwardian buildings and some more modern infill. The centre is in a “Y” shape with the station in the centre and is bounded by predominantly residential on all sides. 5.3.32 The Retail Study indicates that the centre currently has a GOAD/CASA floorspace of 26,000m [2 ] and predicts a need of 1,000-2000m [2 ] between 2001 and 2016. There is also limited scope for additional residential developments in the centre. 5.3.33 The town centre forms part of the Tottenham High Road Historic Corridor, which is a series of Conservation Areas running along Tottenham High Road. In particular, the centre is located within Bruce Grove Conservation Area and, as such, will also be subject to SP 12 Conservation. As part of an improvement package for this corridor, shop front improvements have been carried out which have significantly enhanced the appearance of the centre. 5.3.34 The convenience and comparison shops in this centre very much serve a local need, both in terms of size and variety. The centre also provides for a range of ethnic communities. The uses that contribute to a thriving evening economy are limited in this centre. There was little evidence of antisocial behaviour during the day, according to the Retail Study. The street lighting is rated good and during the day, the centre has a reasonably good feeling of safety. 5.3.35 The High Road and Bruce Grove sometimes have high volumes of traffic which impact on the ease of movement in and around the centre. The general environment could be improved to further accentuate the quality of the buildings. West Green Road/Seven Sisters Road 5.3.36 This district centre is located around Seven Sisters underground station. Since its Roman and Victorian beginnings, the centre has become an important shopping destination for the local community. 108 5.3.37 This centre has 173 retail and service units according to the Retail Study. This figure excludes non-retail Class A uses, but does include some units outside the Council’s designated centre, within the area defined by the GOAD Plans. 5.3.38 The centre is located in two Conservation Areas - Clyde Circus and Seven Sisters/Paige Green. SP12 Conservation applies to those areas affected. 5.3.39 The centre provides for its local diverse community in the goods and services available. This trade mix reflects a primary daytime retail function rather than an active night time economy. 5.3.40 The Retail Study noted very little antisocial behaviour during the day. The street lighting and wider pavements all contribute to making the centre feel quite safe during the day. Green Lanes 5.3.41 Green Lanes is a linear district centre with a row of late-Victorian terraced mansions on one side. The centre includes the Arena Shopping Park, which is a recent addition, and includes a large number of national retailers. Green Lanes has 245 retail/ service units, excluding non retail Class A uses. 5.3.42 The centre provides for a diverse community, with the bulk of the national multiple outlets located in Arena Shopping Park and the independent retailers located along Green Lanes. There is a thriving evening economy with a good range of restaurants. 5.3.43 According to the Retail Study, there is little evidence of anti-social behaviour during the day. The CCTV coverage and police presence are rated as good. However, movement in and around the centre is an issue because of the high level of vehicles along Green Lanes. *Tottenham High Road* Muswell Hill 5.3.44 Muswell Hill was originally a medieval settlement developed near a spring. The centre is now characterised by predominantly Edwardian development. The roads were set out and developed mainly in the late 1890’s and early 1900’s. There are 199 units in the centre, excluding non-retail Class A uses (Retail Study 2008). 5.3.45 The centre is located within Muswell Hill Conservation Area. The Edwardian character of the area is maintained throughout and the status of the Conservation Area and the intention to preserve and protect it contributes to maintaining the centre’s high quality environment. 5.3.46 From the Retail Study, there appeared to be little evidence of antisocial behaviour, such as begging or on-street drinking, and there is good police presence throughout the centre. Overall, there is a feeling of being safe when shopping in Muswell Hill during the day. 5.3.47 The centre also provides an evening economy which is rated as “good,” with a range of bars and restaurants in the primary area of the centre. The centre also offers a range of national and independent shops. 5.3.48 The Retail Study also noted that movement in and around the centre is reasonable, with several crossings. The general quality of the streetscape was rated as poor due to the lack of bins or benches. However, the attractiveness of the commercial properties throughout the centre was considered very good, as the buildings provide a high quality shopping environment that is functional and attractive. Crouch End 5.3.49 Crouch End was a medieval settlement developed around the intersection of several roads. This district centre is characterised by largely Victorian developments. The centre has 267 retail and service units (excluding non retail Class A uses). The bulk of the centre is located in the Crouch End Conservation Area and is also subject to SP12 on Conservation, which aims to protect the status and character of the borough’s conservation areas. 109 *Crouch End Town Centre* 5.3.50 The centre has a good mix of retail and service uses as well as a good range of uses associated with the evening economy. The Retail Study indicates that the centre has low antisocial behaviour and a very good feeling of safety during the day. Crouch End suffers from high volumes of traffic, which converges onto the Broadway, making congestion highest in the primary retail area. There is also a high level of pedestrian/vehicular conflict, but that is somewhat mitigated by the good frequency of pedestrian crossings. Local Shopping Centres 5.3.51 The borough has a network of 38 Local Shopping Centres which provide for the day-to-­ day needs of people living, working and staying nearby. Small specialist shops are essential to sustain the vibrancy and character of shopping areas but they are threatened by the continuing trend towards fewer, larger shops. Haringey’s Retail Capacity Study 2008 recommended that these local shopping centres are retained as the loss of shop units within these centres would harm the character, function, vitality and viability of the centre and general area. Tottenham Hale Retail Park 5.3.52 Tottenham Hale Retail Park is located in the heart of the regeneration programme taking place in Tottenham. Currently, it includes some major retail outlets as well as a large DIY store. In addition to providing a large amount of new housing, the proposed changes to the gyratory system will provide better access to land in very close proximity to the retail park. 5.3.53 As set out in the Tottenham Hale Urban Centre SPD, the site offers an opportunity to expand the retail offer in the area, particularly comparison shopping, and improve the frontage onto Ferry Lane. All of these future changes present an opportunity to review shopping provision and encourage uses that provide cohesion and connectivity to the two district centres, namely Tottenham/Bruce Grove and Seven Sisters/West Green Road, which are in the same locality. In order to fully exploit the potential created by these changes and development in Tottenham Hale, an Area Action Plan will be produced, which will encompass proposals in and around the retail park. In line with section 23 of the NPPF and the London Plan, it is the Council’s intention to designate Tottenham Hale as a District Centre over the life of the Local Plan. Further detail regarding this designation will be set out in an Area Action Plan for Tottenham Hale. INDICATORS Monitoring 5.3.54 SP10 will be monitored regularly to ensure effective delivery of its aims and objectives over the life of the Local Plan. The Authority Monitoring Report will be used to assess the performance of the policy, measured using a list of indicators as set out in Appendix 3.

As well as preserving our rich heritage, the Council will also be contributing to it by making sure that it only permits new buildings of high quality that will be appreciated by future generations. Urban design is about how the urban environment looks and functions and can have a significant impact on people’s quality of life. This will also influence the image of a place, which in turn can affect the economy of an area. 6.1.2 The Council’s overall approach is to manage growth in Haringey in a sustainable way so it meets Haringey’s need for homes, jobs and services, in a way that conserves and enhances the features that make the borough a special and attractive place to live, work and visit. SP11 and 12 set out the Council’s approach to ensuring that design in the borough is of the highest possible quality as well as being sustainable, also that schemes include measures to minimise the effects of, and adapt to, climate change as well as conserving the borough’s rich and diverse heritage. *Heartlands High School* SP11: DESIGN All new development should enhance and enrich Haringey’s built environment and create places and buildings that are high quality, attractive, sustainable, safe and easy to use. To achieve this all development shall: - Be of the highest standard of design that respects its local context and character and historic significance, to contribute to the creation and enhancement of Haringey’s sense of place and identity; - Ensure impacts on health, climate change, natural resources and biodiversity are minimised by adopting and improving sustainable design and construction techniques; - Incorporate solutions to reduce crime and the fear of crime, such as promoting social inclusion; creating well-connected and high quality public realm that is easy and safe to use; and by applying the principles set out in ‘Secured by Design’ and Safer Places; - Promote high quality landscaping on and off site, including improvements to existing streets and public spaces; - Seek the highest standards of access in all buildings and places; and - Ensure buildings are designed to be flexible and adaptable – and able to integrate services and functions. 112 Applications for tall buildings will be assessed against the following criteria: - an adopted Area Action Plan or existing adopted masterplan framework for the site and surrounding area; - assessment supporting tall buildings in a Characterisation Study which should be prepared as supporting evidence for all AAP areas; - compliance with the Development Management Policies criteria for Tall and Large Buildings siting and design; and - compliance with all the relevant recommendations as set out in CABE / English Heritage “Guidance on Tall Buildings”, 2007. High quality design 6.1.3 Good urban design is not just about how places look, but also about how they work. Design has a crucial impact on people’s quality of life and their perception of an area. 6.1.4 The Council will insist on high quality design throughout the borough. In accordance with government guidance in paragraph 64 of the NPPF, the Council will not accept design that is considered inappropriate to its context, or which fails to take opportunities to improve the character and quality of an area and the way it functions. The Council will also take account of the Building for Life (BfL) criteria in the assessment of proposals for residential developments. Please see Building in Context for further guidance in delivering designs which have a regard for local context and character [(http://building-in-context.org/).](http://building-in-context.org) 6.1.5 Development schemes should improve the quality of existing buildings, landscaping and the street environment and, through this, improve the experience of the borough for residents and visitors. 6.1.6 The Haringey Design Panel and Design Awards, which were set up in 2005, provide an opportunity to give recognition to and raise awareness of high quality development within Haringey. All major planning applications are referred to the Design Panel. Sustainable Design and Construction 6.1.7 Layout and design and construction of buildings have significant effect on a building’s environmental and energy performance. The construction and use of buildings currently account for around half of the carbon emissions in Haringey. The Council considers it is important that all new and redeveloped buildings are designed to have a beneficial impact on their environment. 6.1.8 Key areas of focus are reducing energy demand and carbon emissions by improvements to the building fabric, the use of passive solar energy and natural light and ventilation, choosing materials with low embedded energy, and the utilisation of low carbon technologies. These measures should be considered alongside policies on climate change (SP4) 6.1.9 With predicted change in climate in London, measures against heat island effect, use of cooling and shading techniques and the use of sustainable urban drainage measures are all crucial for creating climate resilient communities. Measures to reduce construction waste and water usage, and design solutions which protect and enhance habitats for wildlife are also key components of sustainable design and construction. Please see the Sustainable Design and Construction SPD for further details. Safer and Accessible Design 6.1.10 Well designed buildings and spaces are safe and accessible, and respond flexibly to the needs of their users. Good access benefits everyone but many people are disadvantaged by poor access to facilities. These disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, including disabled people, people with children in pushchairs and the elderly can be particularly affected by poor access, by difficulties in reaching facilities or difficulties in using the facilities themselves. 6.1.11 The Council requires new buildings and spaces to be inclusive and accessible to all. Design and Access Statements will be required for developments to show how the principles of inclusive design and access for all have been integrated into the proposed development. See SP2 Housing on Lifetime Homes and Wheelchair Accessible Housing. 113 6.1.12 In addition, making roads and pavements, and the spaces between buildings fully accessible is as important as making the buildings themselves accessible. The Council will ensure good quality access and circulation arrangements, including improvements to existing routes and footways. Landscaping and public realm 6.1.13 High quality landscaping plays an important role in the attractiveness and character of our surroundings. It can improve the setting of buildings, bring trees and other greenery into built up areas to revive the hard landscaping and provide shade, as well as provide habitats for wildlife. The Council will expect development schemes to provide a high standard of hard and soft landscaping and of boundary features such as walls and fences and private gardens. 6.1.14 The Council will encourage appropriate use of landscaping in the form of green roofs and brown roofs which have a number of environmental benefts, such as providing wildlife habitats, in helping to cool and insulate buildings and in retaining water and helping to reduce fooding, in addition to being visually attractive. Tall Buildings 6.1.15 Haringey is characterised by predominantly low-rise (2-3 storey) residential suburban development across the borough and 3-4 storey development in its town centres. The exception is Wood Green town centre, where buildings within its core area range between 4-9 storeys 6.1.16 The Council has adopted the definition of Tall and Large Buildings as those which are substantially taller than their neighbours, have a significant impact on the skyline, or are of 10 storeys and over or are otherwise larger than the threshold sizes set for referral to the Mayor of London, as set out in the London Plan. *Tottenham Town Hall* 6.1.17 As noted in SP1, the Council will prepare Area Action Plans (AAPs) for the areas identified in Section 3.1. As part of the evidence base for each of these areas, an Urban Characterisation Study (UCS) will assess the urban character of each area concerned, including a sufficient assessment of the surrounding area to consider the context affected by the proposals in the AAP. These Characterisation Studies will examine the case for tall and large buildings and whether there are suitable locations within the area. 6.1.18 The Council considers that currently only two areas, Haringey Heartlands/Wood Green and Tottenham Hale, have sites that may be suitable for some tall or large buildings. This is because they are close to major transport interchanges, have been designated in the London Plan as an Opportunity Area (Tottenham Hale) and an Area for Intensification (Haringey Heartlands/ Wood Green) and have existing adopted Masterplan Frameworks. Any AAPs and associated Characterisation Studies for these areas will supersede these established suitable locations for Tall and Large Buildings with their recommended locations (if any). Elsewhere tall buildings are considered inappropriate to Haringey’s predominantly 2-3 storey residential suburban character until shown otherwise, for example, in AAPs and UCSs. 6.1.19 The Criteria for Siting and Design of Tall and Large Buildings will be described in detail in the Development Management Policies. 6.1.20 In all cases, the design of tall buildings should comply with the recommendations contained in the CABE / English Heritage ‘Guidance on Tall Buildings’ (July 2007). It sets the criteria for evaluating proposals for tall buildings and promotes a plan led approach to tall buildings. INDICATORS Monitoring 6.1.21 SP11 will be monitored regularly to ensure effective delivery of its aims and objectives over the life of the Local Plan. The Authority Monitoring Report will be used to assess the performance of the policy, measured using a list of indicators as set out in Appendix 3. 114 SP12: CONSERVATION - The Council shall ensure the conservation of the historic significance of Haringey’s heritage assets, their setting, and the wider historic environment. The borough’s heritage assets include Statutory Listed Buildings, Conservation Areas, Registered Parks and Gardens, Archaeological Priority Areas, and other locally important heritage assets such as Locally Listed Buildings, Local Historic Green Spaces and Sites of Industrial Heritage Interest. Where archaeological excavation is required, findings should be published, disseminated, and used as the basis for archaeological interpretation on site. - The Historic Environment should be used as the basis for heritage-led regeneration and as the basis for good design and positive change. Where possible, development should help increase accessibility to the historic environment. All development shall protect the Strategic view from Alexandra Palace to St Paul’s Cathedral as protected in the London Mayoral “London View Management Framework” Revised SPG, July 2010, and key local views. Haringey’s heritage 6.2.1 Haringey has a rich and diverse Heritage. The Historic Environment Record consists of: - 471 Statutory Listed Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest; - 1150 Locally Listed Buildings of Merit; - 29 Conservation Areas, four of which have Article 4 Directions (Rookfield, Tower Gardens, Noel Park and Peabody Cottages); - 2 English Heritage Statutory Registered Parks & Gardens of Special Historic Interest; (Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace Park); - 34 Local Historic Green Spaces; - 23 Designated Sites of Industrial Heritage Interest; and - 22 Archaeological Priority Areas. *Bruce Grove* *Dial House, Tottenham* 115 6.2.2 The borough’s built heritage, which includes locally distinctive landmarks, creates a sense of place and stability. It also supports local economic competitiveness (by providing attractive places for people to live and work) and promotes community cohesion through shared culture and identity. The borough’s built form is made up of a series of residential communities centred around a commercial core, each with their own unique identity that developed around the distinctive characteristics of the borough’s historic centres (Highgate, Hornsey, and Tottenham). The settlement pattern has followed the historic routes that radiate north from the City of London, around which, small rural villages developed during the medieval period. Throughout history, these settlements have been expanded, with earlier buildings being interwoven with, or replaced by later development. Haringey experienced rapid development during the 19th Century as a result of industrialisation, resulting in a provision of all forms of buildings; residential, industrial, commercial and civic. 6.2.3 The residential housing within the historic areas can be generally characterised by its period. Throughout the borough, but largely within Highgate and Tottenham, there are Georgian buildings which are typically large detached or semi-detached houses and villas or grand terraces, with large gardens to the rear. 6.2.4 The coming of the railways from the 1850‘s onwards led to rapid urbanisation; by 1900 much of Haringey had been transformed from a rural environment to an urban one. Development followed the routes leading to central London. The Great Northern Railway line is the effective east/west divide in Haringey, and bisects the borough into two parts with Wood Green on the east side and Hornsey on the west side. 6.2.5 Most of the 19th Century development can be characterised as a mixture of detached, semi-­ detached and terraced housing, typically laid out in a traditional perimeter block form with frontages facing the street and with private rear gardens. They are designed with a variety of architectural detailing, but are mainly two or three storeys in height and usually of brick with slate or clay tiled roofs. As a result, they create visually and socially coherent uniform street scenes and neighbourhoods of distinctive suburban character and appearance. 6.2.6 20th Century development has consisted mainly of public and private housing estates on what remained of the open farmland, such as Tower Gardens, Rookfield, Broadwater Farm and White Hart Lane Estates. The borough also has some fine examples of 20th Century modernist apartment buildings, most notably Lubetkin’s Highpoint I and II (Grade I listed) in Highgate. However, it is recognised that post-­ war development in the borough has not always been of the highest quality design, or sensitive to its setting. As such, the Council will seek to ensure that future development will be of the highest possible quality of design as well as meeting the Council’s green agenda. 6.2.7 Green Lanes is an ancient thoroughfare along which cattle were driven from Hertfordshire towards Smithfield Market in London. Since late medieval times small hamlets emerged at intersections with Green Lanes, however, the area retained its rural quality until the mid nineteenth century with the arrival of the railways. The railway enabled the rapid mass transportation of workers into Kings Cross and had a marked impact on the subsequent urbanisation of the area. Wood Green is now a busy Metropolitan town centre. Its High Road, the main shopping spine, is part of Green Lanes and stretches from Wood Green tube station to the next station along the Piccadilly line, Turnpike Lane. The character of Green Lanes down to Manor House reflects the diverse range of communities with sizable commercial and residential populations of Greeks, Turks, Cypriots and Kurds. 116 117 Haringey’s character 6.2.8 The Council recognised, with the statutory introduction of Conservation Areas, that Highgate and Tottenham High Road were important areas in terms of their character. As a result, they were the frst two conservation areas to be designated in Haringey. They are amongst the oldest areas of development in the borough but have developed in different ways. 6.2.9 The section below describes these two very different Conservation Areas. Highgate 6.2.10 Highgate was designated a Conservation Area in 1967, and forms part of an area of great historical and architectural interest. The earliest records describe Highgate as a meeting place of many paths and roads, with fne commanding views and clean country air in close proximity to the City of London. The core of the village was established in the 15th Century. During the 17th and 18th Centuries Highgate became a fashionable retreat for the nobility and merchants, and an important staging post on the Great North Road. 6.2.11 Many of the large villas and their grounds have been replaced by more compact housing, though Cromwell House (104 Highgate Hill) remains a fne example of a 17th Century building, and as such has been statutory listed Grade I. Elsewhere the street scene owes much to the rich variety of Georgian and Victorian houses, with occasional modern developments such as High Point I and II, also Grade I listed. 6.2.12 Highgate today largely retains its original 17th and 18th century layout and design. The High Street and central village areas are built on a domestic scale, with the majority being two or three storey Georgian and early Victorian houses, several of which have later additions and alterations. Outside of the centre there are many buildings of historical and architectural interest, including churches, schools and residential properties. 6.2.13 The majority of Haringey’s future growth will take place outside Highgate Village. However, it is important that this growth respects the character of its surroundings and conserves heritage and other important features. Please see SP1 for the Council’s approach to areas of more limited change. It is important to note that the responsibility of Highgate Conservation Area is divided between the boroughs of Haringey and Camden, the boundary between which, runs down the middle of Highgate High Street. The Council will continue to work with the London Borough of Camden to ensure the conservation area continues to be protected. Tottenham High Road Historic Corridor 6.2.14 The Tottenham High Road Historic Corridor covers an extensive area, stretching approximately 3.7km between Enfield to the north and Stamford Hill to the south. Accordingly, it is relatively diverse in character and appearance and is subdivided into six Conservation Areas, each with unifying characteristics such as scale, massing, use, architectural style and detailing and period of development. 6.2.15 Tottenham High Road Historic Corridor is centred upon the High Road; a wide, busy road which is fronted almost continuously by terraces of three or four storeys, with commercial uses at ground floor. However, interspersed within the frontage are a number of larger civic, educational and religious buildings. There are also a number of open spaces along the length of the High Road, at Scotland Green, Tottenham Green and Seven Sisters/Page Green. The residential roads flanking the High Road are characterised by more finely grained terraces of two and, occasionally three storeys with a greater degree of uniformity in materials and architectural detailing. The character of the High Road and its restaurants, cafes, retailing and commercial outlets reflects its diverse ethnic mix. 6.2.16 The eastern part of the borough is where most of Haringey’s future growth will take place. Where this growth is adjacent to the Tottenham High Road Historic Corridor, the Council will seek to ensure that future development takes into account its sensitive context and maximises opportunities and benefits for the *Tower Gardens Conservation Area* local area as a whole. 118 Strategic and Local Views 6.2.17 In Haringey the view of St Paul’s Cathedral and the City from Alexandra Palace is identifed in the London Plan and the London View Management Framework as a strategically important Landmark Viewing Corridor: London Panorama 1. Proposed developments within London Panoramas should fit within the prevailing pattern of buildings and spaces and should not detract from the panorama as a whole. Haringey has sought to take account of this strategic view and promotes its protection against the impact of development proposals which fall within the boundaries of the following zones: - The viewing corridor (the direct view from Alexandra Palace to St. Paul Cathedral); - The wider setting (the area immediately surrounding the viewing corridor affecting its setting); - The mid-ground (the high ridge area where any development higher may be visible from the viewpoint); and - The foreground (the open landscape with sloping park). 6.2.18 In addition to the strategic view, there are also many local views within the borough. The Council will consider the impact of a scheme in terms of townscape, landscape and skyline, and will seek to ensure that development is compatible with such views in terms of setting, scale and massing. The Council will resist proposals that we consider will cause harm to these views. 6.2.19 The Council will seek to protect locally important views that contribute to the interest and character of the borough. These may include: - Views of and from large parks and open spaces, such as Alexandra Palace and Finsbury Park and other public parks on the Local Register of Historic Parks and Gardens; - Views into, within and from Conservation Areas; and - Views of listed and landmark buildings and monuments. 6.2.20 The Local Views will be identified in a schedule within the Development Management Policies and the proposed Conservation SPD. The Council will refer to English Heritage guidance ‘Seeing the History in the View’ when producing its list of Local Views. INDICATORS Monitoring 6.2.21 SP12 will be monitored regularly to ensure effective delivery of its aims and objectives over the life of the Local Plan. The Authority Monitoring Report will be used to assess the performance of the policy, measured using a list of indicators as set out in Appendix 3.

The borough boasts many different types of open spaces that are important in terms of health, sport, recreation and play, heritage, the economy, culture, biodiversity, providing a pleasant outlook and breaks in built up areas. 6.3.2 Haringey’s future growth will increase the use and hence the demand for good quality open spaces. Therefore, it is important that the Council protects its existing parks and open spaces and increases access to those areas defcient in open space. As the objective in Section 1 sets out, the Council wishes to promote a network of high quality, accessible open spaces as areas for recreation, visual interest and biodiversity improving access to the Lee Valley Regional Park. SP13 sets out the Council’s approach to protecting the borough’s existing parks and open spaces and improving access to those areas deficient in public open space. SP13: OPEN SPACE AND BIODIVERSITY New development shall protect and improve Haringey’s parks and open spaces. All new development shall: - Protect and enhance, and when and where possible, extend the existing boundaries of the borough’s Green Belt, designated Metropolitan Open Land, designated Open Spaces, Green Chains, allotments, river corridors and other open spaces from inappropriate development; - Provide amenity space in accordance with the Council’s Open Space and Recreational Standards Supplementary Planning Document (SPD); - Manage the impact of such new developments in areas adjacent to designated open space; - Secure improvements, enhancement and management in both quality and access to existing green spaces; - Seek on-site or financial contributions towards open space from new developments as set out in the Open Space and Recreational Standards SPD; - Seek to secure opportunities for additional publicly accessible open space especially in those identified areas of Open Space deficiency e.g. in the east of the borough where the quality and amount of provision is poorer as set out in the Council’s Open Space and Recreational Standards SPD; and - Conserve the historic significance of the borough’s designated historic parks and gardens. 120 All development shall protect and improve sites of biodiversity and nature conservation, including private gardens through its: - Contribution to wildlife and ecological habitats and, where possible, include green and brown roofs, rainwater harvesting, green walls, bird and bat nesting/roosting opportunities; - Protection, management and maintenance of existing trees and the planting of new trees where appropriate; and - Protection, enhancement and creation of Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINCs) and Local Nature Reserves (LNRs). The Council will enhance and improve the borough’s green infrastructure through: - Implementation of the Haringey Green Grid projects (such as Lordship Recreation Ground Improvements); - Working with adjoining boroughs and partners to safeguard the existing Green Infrastructure, to create new green infrastructure and link up sites; and - Working with Lee Valley Regional Park Authority to protect and enhance access to the park, its waterside open spaces and habitats, recreational and sporting facilities. New development shall provide opportunities for Children’s Play Space by: - Protecting and enhancing existing play spaces; - Making provision for children’s informal or formal play space in addition to amenity space provision as set out above; - Provide children’s informal or formal play space to meet minimum of 3m [2] as set out in the Council’s Open Space Standards SPD and an aspirational target of 10m [2] as set out in the Mayor’s SPG Providing for Children’s and Young People’s Play and Informal recreation; - Ensuring easy access to a range of quality and safe play opportunities for all children and within a practical journey from their home without the need to use public or private transport; - Provide play spaces that are attractive, welcoming and engaging for all children and young people, children of both gender, disabled children and children from minority groups in the community; and - Securing a financial contribution pursuant to a S106 Agreement towards the provision of Children’s Play Space and ensuring its long term maintenance is addressed through planning obligations. Developers will need to demonstrate: - That the potential for play spaces for a range of outdoor activities and across different age groups can be provided on off-site open space(s) which already exist and which are close to the application site; - They’re working with the relevant agencies, community groups and developers to ensure the provision of safe, stimulating play facilities; and - How they will secure new open spaces and SINCs, through identifying and securing funding to purchase and enhance such sites in areas of deficiency, such that there is a net increase in provision. Protecting our open spaces 6.3.3 The Council will protect the borough’s designated and other open spaces as well as other suitable land with the potential to be used as open space. Development will not be permitted on these open spaces, unless it is for limited small scale development ancillary to an existing use on the land and for which there is a demonstrable need. The Council will only allow development on designated open spaces or sites adjacent to an open space that respects the size, form and use of that open space and does not detract from the overall openness and character of the site, the appearance and historical significance of the setting, or harms the public enjoyment. 6.3.4 Local open spaces form part of the wider network of open spaces which are integral and vital to the spatial character of the borough and to residents’ quality of life (further details in SP11 Design). Open spaces of local importance in the borough can include, but are not limited to, parks, allotments, woodlands, sports facilities, water courses, children’s play areas (both formal and informal), back and front gardens, amenity spaces and squares. The level of public access is not a criterion for definition. Where desirable, and where the open space in question has identifiable value, the Council will resist any development that results in a net loss of this open space. 121 *Tottenham Green* 6.3.5 Haringey’s Open Space Strategy ‘A Space for Everyone’ (2006), considers the supply of open spaces in the borough and identified eight strategic objectives to improve the quality, range, usage and management of provision. The borough has achieved Green Flag Status, which exemplifies areas of Open Space of outstanding quality, for fourteen parks: this is the highest awarded to any London borough. To date, improvement works to Markfield Park include the construction of a new cafe and park toilets, improved sports pavilion, new playground, restored beam engine, heritage building works to the (Markfield) Museum and general landscape improvements throughout the park. Lordship Recreation Ground will also undergo considerable works, including installation of a new play ground, creation of a city farm and a new environment centre providing a park cafe and community rooms. *Narrowboats on the River Lea* *Wood Green Common* 6.3.6 The Tottenham Hale Urban Centre Masterplan Supplementary Planning Document includes an extensive east-west green link proposal -­ Ashley Link. This is a green link that extends Cheshnut Road for pedestrians eastward towards the waterfront connecting to the proposed footbridge across to the river to Hale Wharf. The link will be a wide pedestrian and cycle only link (Please see SP1 Managing Growth). Further information with regard to planned green infrastructure projects is reflected in Appendix 4 Infrastructure Delivery Plan. 6.3.7 However, it is not just green spaces that contribute to the borough’s Open Space network, but also waterways, which form a vital link between Open Spaces throughout London. In the borough, the two most important waterways are the River Lee (which flows through the Lee Valley) and the Moselle Brooke, which runs under the Heartlands/Wood Green growth area. The Haringey Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) (2009) includes as part of the future plans for rivers and streams, the restoration of Moselle Brook in Lordship Recreation Ground in Tottenham (See SP5 Water Management and Flooding). The Council will conserve the historic significance of the borough’s waterways, to ensure that the heritage values of the River Lee and the Moselle Brook are conserved for the community. 122 123 6.3.8 The Lee Valley Regional Park (LVRP) Plan (2000) acknowledged that the environmental and recreational role of the River Lee had yet to be fully recognised. Proposals in the LVRP Plan (2000) include a broad spectrum of recreational, leisure and nature conservation for the area. The New River forms another equally important green/river corridor (also flowing through the Lee Valley). The River Lee Navigation offers an important link between parts of the borough’s green spaces and other green spaces in North London including the Olympic Park. These environmental assets are important in that they promote linkages to the East London Green Grid and London’s Blue Ribbon Network. The Council will support the Lee Valley Regional Park Authority and other partners in their efforts to increase the range and access to Open Space for both borough residents and visitors. Green Belt 6.3.9 The Green Belt has a structural role to play in the borough and therefore requires the strongest level of protection. It is of national and regional importance and its aim is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open. Green Belt is protected in line with section 9 of the NPPF and the London Plan. Within Haringey an area of the Lee Valley Regional Park is strategically designated as Green Belt. It provides a range of sporting, nature conservation and recreational activities for both residents of the borough and visitors alike. The LVRP Plan (2000) sets out its vision for the park as a cohesive, sustainable and valued regional green lung, with emphasis on the biodiversity and water assets of the area. The Council will protect existing Green Belt land and strongly resist any inappropriate development there. 6.3.10 The Lee Valley Regional Park Authority is currently working to identify a new series of proposals for the future uses and management of the park - the Park Development Framework. Tottenham Marshes located in the Lee Valley Park, north of Tottenham Hale on the borders of Haringey and Waltham Forest, is an urban oasis and an area for informal recreation set within a waterside park. Large areas of the marshes are managed for nature conservation with wildflower meadows, woodlands, scrub and a new pond. Metropolitan Open Land (MOL) 6.3.11 Metropolitan Open Land (MOL) is defined as open land within a built-up area which has wider than borough significance. It receives the same presumption against development as Green Belt land. MOL is specific to London in that it contributes to the physical structure of London’s landscape and helps shape the pattern of development so that it occurs in suitable locations. There are 17 areas designated as MOL in Haringey, including Alexandra Park and Palace. Haringey’s MOL will be protected in accordance with the London Plan. The London Plan strongly supports the current extent of the Green Belt and Metropolitan Open Land, its extension in appropriate circumstances and its protection from development having an adverse impact on the openness of MOL. The Council will protect existing MOL and resist any inappropriate development. The Council will, through the appropriate channels, review and upgrade or remove, as appropriate, existing open land to or from MOL designation where there is evidence to support such a move. Further policy provision on MOL will be provided in the Development Management Policies. 124 Green Chains 6.3.12 Green chains provide a valuable connection between open spaces, and their protection will enable breaks in the built up environment to be maintained, securing a positive visual contribution and variety to the borough. They have structural significance to the borough as a whole and may have significance to the whole or part of London. The value of green chains includes nature conservation, public access, recreation, including footpath walks, breaks in the urban area, and delineation of separate communities. Allotments 6.3.13 The Council will seek to protect, and where possible, through development opportunities, increase the allotment space and promote and encourage sustainable food growing in the borough. Where allotments become surplus to demand, other open space uses will be considered first before allotment sites are developed, particularly where there is a deficiency in open space provision in the area. 6.3.14 There are 42 hectares of managed allotments in the borough providing a total of 1650 individual plots. This equates to 0.18 hectares of allotment space and 7.9 plots per 1,000 residents. The standard, as set out in Haringey’s Open Space and Recreational Standards SPD 2008, says that there should be 0.24 ha of allotment space per 1000, with all residents having access to an allotment within 800m of their home. The Council is in the process of bringing back to full use an additional two currently disused sites. In line with the findings of the Council’s Community Infrastructure Plan (2009), further thought must be given to increasing allotment provision in those wards where there is an identified shortage. These include Bounds Green, Bruce Grove, Crouch End, Fortis Green, Harringay, Hornsey, Northumberland Park, Seven Sisters, St. Ann’s, Tottenham Green and Tottenham Hale. 6.3.15 Allotments provide valuable cultivation space for residents who have no access to a private back garden, or to residents who require space additional to their back garden space in which to cultivate fruit, vegetables or flowers. Following a decline in the demand for allotments, their popularity has enjoyed a recent increase. They provide a valuable open space experience for local residents acting as a “lung” in a similar way to parkland. Both cultivated and untended plots contribute to maintaining biodiversity. They also provide an opportunity for exercise in the form of cultivating, and they play a very important role in sustainability, by allowing residents to grow their own produce. Finally, allotments also have a historical and cultural role. 6.3.16 In addition, A Sustainable Food Strategy for Haringey is being developed with the objectives of: - Improving health and reducing health inequalities; - Increasing resource efficiency; - Increasing individual and community food growing; - Supporting a vibrant food economy; and - Celebrating and promoting food culture and diversity. 125 126 6.3.17 Haringey’s communities have developed a number of innovative community food growing schemes such as Back 2 Earth in Broadwater Farm, Living Under One Sun community allotment in Tottenham, and Wolves Lane Nursery redevelopment. Figure 6.3 shows the sustainable food infrastructure in the borough and current gaps in provision. 6.3.18 Haringey is committed to developing additional growing spaces in the borough, working in partnership with Capital Growth. In addition to the 25 allotments Haringey currently has: - 12 community growing spaces ranging from large community allotments to smaller growing spaces; - Nine network hubs: these social networks enable residents to share knowledge and skills related to urban food growing; and - 12 school growing areas such as micro food farms, vegetable plots or roof gardens. An additional six schools have recently been awarded funding to create growing spaces. Please also see SP14 for the Council’s approach to health and well-being and healthy eating. Open space deficiency 6.3.19 Parks and Open Spaces are of great importance to Haringey in terms of sport, recreation and play, biodiversity, culture, regeneration, the economy and in breaking up built up areas. The Open Space and Sports Assessment study (Atkins 2004, as updated 2008) found that Haringey has overall provision for 1.7ha of open space per 1,000 population. The study details the open space hierarchy as well as the distribution of the amount and type of public open space in the borough. It identified areas deficient in public open space as those which are further than 280m and 400m from any form of public open space. Those areas of the borough deficient in public open space include, but is not limited to, Northumberland Park, parts of White Hart Lane ward, parts of Bounds Green ward, parts of Fortis Green and Alexandra wards, part of Highgate ward, parts of Crouch End ward, parts of St Ann’s, Harringay and Seven Sisters wards and the east of Seven Sisters ward (Figure 6.4). The Council’s Open Space Strategy notes that the study excluded green amenity areas which form part of housing estates and allotments in its definition of open spaces. In conclusion, the study sets out a series of recommendations with guidance to address both open space deficiencies and to improve the range and condition of facilities within existing open spaces. 6.3.20 According to the Council’s Infrastructure Delivery Plan, for Haringey to maintain its current level of public open space provision or to meet the goals set out in the Open Space and Recreational Standards SPD, an increase of between approximately 24 and 32 hectares of public open space would be required by 2016. However, there is a real difficulty in increasing the quantity of public open space in Haringey as it is an urban borough and the focus is therefore primarily on the function, quality, usage and accessibility of existing public open space. The Council will need to seek to create new open space where the opportunity to do so arises as well as seeking to improve the quality and usage and accessibility of existing public open space. An ongoing programme of improvements to existing parks has been identified in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan (Appendix 4). 127 128 6.3.21 For growth areas, as a focus for new housing in the borough, Haringey Heartlands will create demand for open space in Noel Park ward and part of Hornsey Ward. Part of Noel Park ward is considered to be deficient in access to public open space. Options for increasing access to Alexandra Palace Park from Haringey Heartlands should be considered. In either instance, S106 monies should be secured as part of the development to help towards the cost of increasing provision of or access to open space in the area. 6.3.22 Tottenham Hale covers the Tottenham Hale and Tottenham Green wards. Given the proximity of Tottenham Hale to Lee Valley Regional Park and other local parks, this growth area generally has good access to public open space. However, there is a pocket of Tottenham Green ward which suffers from poor access. As part of the development of Greater Ashley Road, there is commitment to improve accessibility to existing open space. Nature conservation 6.3.23 Haringey has a total of 60 areas designated as Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation Importance (SINCs). Of these; five are of Metropolitan Importance (i.e. important in a London-wide context), nine of Borough Grade 1 Importance, 13 Borough Grade II and 33 of Local Importance. Haringey is home to three Local Nature Reserves (LNRs); these are places with wildlife or geological features that are of special interest locally. They offer people special opportunities to study or learn about nature or simply to enjoy it. LNR’s are a statutory designation made under the National Parks and Access to Countryside Act 1949.The three sites are the Parkland Walk, Railway Fields and Queens Wood. SINCs within the borough include Bluebell Wood and Muswell Hill Golf Course, Tottenham Cemetery and Bruce Castle Park. 6.3.24 The Council will not permit development on SINCS and LNRs unless there are exceptional circumstances and where the importance of any development coming forward outweighs the nature conservation value of the site. In such circumstances, or where a site has more than one designation, appropriate mitigation measures must be taken and where practicable and reasonable, additional nature conservation space must be provided. Each case will be looked at on its merits, having regard to all material considerations. The Council and statutory undertakers, who own some of the designated sites, have a duty to have regard to conserving biodiversity. Although most SINCs in Haringey are not in the Council’s control, the Council will seek to protect species, habitats and areas from inappropriate and harmful development. 6.3.25 Other sites of ecological value include green chains and ecological corridors (of which there are seven in Haringey), which mainly comprise operational railway land. The Council will continue to protect all sites in the borough formally identified as being of nature conservation value (Figure 6.2) and seek to identify and protect any new corridors which meet the criteria for determining their ecological value. 6.3.26 The EC Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and Wild Flora and Fauna) establishes the requirement for Habitats Regulation Assessment. The ‘Habitats Directive’ provides legal protection for habitats and species of European Importance and the Directive requires an assessment of plans to prevent significant adverse effects on European sites i.e. sites of international importance. Haringey Habitats Regulation Assessment (HRA) identifies three European Sites within a 10km radius of the borough; The Lee Valley Ramsar Site; The Lee Valley Special Protection Area; and Epping Forest Special Area of Conservation. 129 6.3.27 The HRA screening report includes the Play facilities following recommendations; ‘No development will be permitted unless either it establishes 6.3.31 that it is not likely to have a significant effect on any Ramsar site or Natura 2000 site (including Special Protection Areas, potential Special Protection Areas, Special Areas of Conservation, candidate or possible Special Areas of Conservation), or it is ascertained, following Appropriate Assessment, that it will not adversely affect the integrity of any Ramsar site or Natura 2000 site’. 6.3.28 The Haringey Biodiversity Action Plan 2009 aims to conserve, enrich and improve biodiversity value and celebrate the wildlife in Haringey through informing local people and involving more people in its enjoyment and conservation and, where possible, increase the population of key species and habitats, such as woodland. 6.3.29 The Council’s Greenest Borough Strategy 2008-2018 ‘Going Green’, sets out the long term strategy and framework to secure a clean, safe and environmentally sustainable future for the borough. With regard to biodiversity and nature conservation in the borough, any new development and regeneration in general will have some potential to contribute towards nature conservation. 6.3.30 Trees play a significant role in improving environmental conditions and people’s quality of life. The Council is responsible for approximately 40,000 trees, located on streets and housing sites, in parks and open spaces, in woodlands and conservation sites, in schools and in the grounds of other public buildings. The Council’s Tree Strategy 2008-2011 aims to ensure trees within the borough are managed in a pro-active and systematic manner. 6.3.31 Haringey Council’s Children and Young People’s Strategic Plan 2009 - 2020 ‘Better Futures’ notes that the borough is home to approximately 55,000 children and young people and the approach to play is set out in the Council’s Play Strategy. The Council currently provides a range of play facilities in parks, open spaces and on housing estates, including 107 playgrounds (29 of which are located in parks), and 25 ball courts in parks and on housing estates in the borough. These facilities are available free of charge throughout the year. 6.3.32 Haringey’s Open Space Strategy undertook an audit of the quality of existing play provision in the borough; it identified a need for considerable further investment in play facilities. As a result of funding secured in 2009 from the government investment in children’s play, Playbuilder Project, the development of 22 new or existing play areas took place between 2009 - 2011. 6.3.33 Haringey’s population is growing and changing. The population in the borough is set to increase by 15% between 2011- 2026, an increase to over 260,000 people. The Council wants to ensure that the right tenures and sizes of housing will be available (see SP2 Housing for further details). The proposed mixture of housing tenure and type (i.e. family or flatted) will inform the precise nature and layout of each play space (and the proximity of existing play areas). The Council will ensure that adequate provision is made through the planning process. Details of developer contribution and provision requirement towards children’s play space are fully outlined in the Open Space and Recreational Standards SPD (2008) and SP17 Delivering and Monitoring. 130 6.3.34 In particular circumstances, where relevant and appropriate, the Council will allow the off-site provision of new facilities and/or the further development of already existing outdoor activities and facilities to meet the open space and recreational requirements of development arising from the planning application that is being considered. This offsite provision will frequently supplement the provision of new facilities/open space that have been proposed on the application site as part of the application, but where that provision is considered to be insufficient to meet the anticipated demand arising as a result of the development. Where additional demand for play space is created by new development, Haringey will expect the provision of play space on site, broadly in accordance with the London Plan and the Mayor’s SPG Providing for Children and Young People’s Play and Informal Recreation. *Bruce Castle Park* INDICATORS Monitoring 6.3.35 SP13 will be monitored regularly to ensure effective delivery of its aims and objectives over the life of the Local Plan. The Authority Monitoring Report will be used to assess the performance of the policy, measured using a list of indicators as set out in Appendix 3. The key infrastructure which will support the delivery of SP13 are set out in Appendix 4 (Infrastructure Delivery Plan). 131 Key evidence and references - Haringey Open Space and Recreational Standards Supplementary Planning Document, London Borough of Haringey 2008 - Haringey’s Greenest Borough Strategy, London Borough of Haringey 2008 - The London Plan, Mayor of London 2011 - National Planning Policy Framework, 2012 - Haringey Tree Strategy 2008 - 2011, London Borough of Haringey 2008 - Providing for Children and Young People’s Play and Informal Recreation Supplementary Planning Guidance, Mayor of London 2008 - Haringey Play Strategy 2006 - 2010, London Borough of Haringey 2006 - Haringey Open Space Strategy 2006 - 2016, London Borough of Haringey 2006 - Haringey Biodiversity Action Plan, London Borough of Haringey 2009 - Connecting with London’s nature: The Mayor’s Biodiversity Strategy, Greater London Authority 2002. 132",

A wider sense of well-being is influenced by a variety of factors such as opportunities for work and recreation, attractive historic environments, personal relationships and feelings of safety and community. 7.1.2 One of the key priorities of Haringey’s Sustainable Community Strategy is improving health and community well-being by providing better housing, meeting health and community needs and encouraging lifetime well-being at home, work, play and learning. 7.1.3 Strategic Policy 14 contributes towards the overall aim of the Local Plan to manage the impact of Haringey’s future growth by setting out the Council’s approach to improving health and well-being in the borough as well as providing access to medical services and treatments. It should be read alongside SP16 Community Facilities, and the Council’s Infrastructure Delivery Plan which sets out the future need for health care in the borough. SP14: HEALTH AND WELL-BEING The Council will seek to improve health and well-­ being in Haringey. The Council will: - Work with NHS Haringey in its goal to reduce health inequalities in the areas with poorest health; - Identify appropriate sites for new health infrastructure including those in Haringey’s growth areas based on a health service delivery plan agreed by the Council and its partners; - Protect existing facilities and support the provision of new or improved health facilities through land use planning area plans, development management decisions, improved service management plans and through planning contributions (see SP17); - Prioritise interventions and resources to those areas of the borough where health inequalities are greatest; and - Support the integration of community facilities and services, i.e. health, education, cultural and leisure in multi-purpose buildings. 134 7.1.4 Many measures set out in the Local Plan play a part in promoting good health and addressing health inequalities, for example: - Integrating housing types and tenures in developments, ensuring new housing is of a good standard, which are well designed, flexible and adaptable to residents’ changing and specific needs, with consideration of the ageing population and meeting the demands for specialised care, and supported housing (see SP2); - Encouraging physical activity and good mental health by providing, protecting and enhancing good quality open spaces, outdoor sports, recreation facilities and children’s play space (see SP13); - Encouraging physical activity by promoting walking and cycling (see SP7); - Improving road safety by implementing area-based traffic calming schemes and safe walking and cycling routes (see SP7); - Providing jobs and opportunities (see SP8 and 9); and - Lessening environmental impacts including air and noise pollution (see SP6). *Priory Park, Muswell Hill* Health needs in Haringey 7.1.5 Types and levels of health issues vary considerably across Haringey and spatial planning has a role in meeting health needs throughout the borough. The reasons for these variations are complex and are likely to include both disparities in health need and demand for health services. It is likely that these variations reflect the different capacity and capability in primary care services to prevent, identify and treat ill health. 7.1.6 Health inequalities in Haringey are apparent with the most deprived areas tending to experience the poorest health. All geographical locations, however, experience trends of specific health problems. In the east, there are high rates of hospital admissions for mental health needs, and the north east of the borough experiences the highest levels of chronic kidney disease, smoking, dementia and stroke. The central part of the borough has the highest levels of registered pulmonary heart disease, heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; while the west experiences the highest levels of cancer. 135 7.1.7 Haringey Council, Haringey NHS and Haringey’s Strategic Partnership work in partnership to identify the key priorities of the borough’s residents through Haringey’s Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA). The JSNA data highlights the health needs and current trends in the borough in order to further understand and address the existing inequalities. Overall, life expectancy rates in Haringey are increasing and are expected to improve further; although male life expectancy rates still remain below the national average. Within the borough male life expectancy in the west is higher than the east by 6.5 years. The east/west divide for women’s life expectancy is less evident and the borough average is equal to that of the UK. 7.1.8 The main health problems experienced in the borough are cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) which account for 60% of deaths in the under 75s population, and rates of stroke and diabetes are higher in Haringey than nationally. Further projections for health predict that by 2025 approximately 75% of the over 65s population in Haringey will be living with a limiting long term illness. 7.1.9 Key priorities and areas of unmet need identified by NHS Haringey and the JSNA include alcohol, improved management and earlier detection of long term conditions including diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Delivering health facilities and services 7.1.10 NHS Haringey and its partners recognise the challenges facing the borough in terms of addressing health inequalities and improving health outcomes. The NHS Haringey Strategic Plan 2009 – 2014 is the overarching plan for improving the quality of health care services and the health and well-being of the residents. The plan recognises the challenges and sets out goals to address them. These goals emphasise the importance of providing local and accessible care through neighbourhood health centres; delivering good quality, cost effective services; safeguarding children and adults; and partnership working with greater emphasis on joint commissioning of services and improving health and well-being. This plan is monitored and reviewed every six months and revised annually to ensure it reflects the needs and trends of health issues in the borough. 7.1.11 The focus of future land and facility requirements will be on ensuring there is adequate primary care provision in the borough to meet the objectives of Haringey NHS World Class Commissioning Strategy. At the heart of the primary care strategy is the establishment of the four Commissioning Collaboratives, Central, North East, South East and West. 7.1.12 The Central Neighbourhood has 18 GP practices and good access to these health services with the majority of households able to access the practices within ten minutes walking time. Residents of the neighbourhood can also access the Laurels NHC and Hornsey Central NHC. 7.1.13 The North East Neighbourhood has 14 GP practices for which over half of households can access within five minutes walking time and all households have access within 20 minutes walking time. Lordship Lane Health Centre situated in Tottenham is the NHC for this area and is accessible to over 50% of households within 20 minutes walking time. An increased requirement for health services has been identified in the north east of the borough as the area which experiences high levels of health inequalities. 136 7.1.14 The South East Neighbourhood has 15 existing GP practices and The Laurels NHC at St Ann’s Road is accessible to almost a 100% of households within 20minutes walking time. This centre works in tandem with Tynemouth Road Health Centre in which capacity has been released to provide women’s health care services closer to home and to meet the needs of the residents more efficiently. 7.1.15 The West Neighbourhood has 18 practices accessible to 94% of households within 15 minutes walking time and 100% of households in 20 minutes. Hornsey Central NHC is accessible to under half of households in less than 20 minutes walking time, though two thirds of households can access the centre in a 20 minutes public bus journey, and 96.2% of households in a 30 minutes bus journey. This low access can be attributed to the fact that this is geographically the largest area. 7.1.16 These centres are integral to the collaborative primary and community health care networks which respond to the specific health needs of each neighbourhood and deliver local health services by providing community based services including health visitors, district nurses, and information and support healthy lifestyles. Each NHC will be patient centred in their care, encouraging patients to participate in their health care and have greater autonomy. The centres are led by local clinicians and will be supported by emerging neighbourhood commissioning teams. Individual neighbourhood plans reflect the specific local health issues for each area and the priorities of the borough and the entire sector. This follows central government directives for future provision and the approach adopted across London for future facilities. 7.1.17 With no general hospital within Haringey’s boundaries, residents primarily use North Middlesex Hospital in Enfield to the north and the Whittington Hospital in Islington to the south. Other hospitals in the capital will also be used to provide specialist services for Haringey residents. Previous analysis has identified that over three quarters of Haringey’s households are able to access either the North Middlesex or the Whittington hospitals within a 30 minute bus journey, while 100% of households are able to access one of the hospitals within a 45 minute bus journey. 7.1.18 Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust provides a range of mental health services principally to people living in the boroughs of Barnet, Enfield and Haringey. The Trust also provides a number of specialist services to a wider population across North London and beyond. In Haringey, the Trust owns the St. Ann’s Hospital site and provides a range of mental health services on site. St. Ann’s Hospital site is a 29 acre site in the Seven Sisters area of the borough. The Trust occupies just half of the current buildings on the site, including the inpatient mental health unit for Haringey. The Trust also operates a set of smaller Mental Health centres located in the community, including Tynemouth Road centre in Tottenham and Canning Crescent centre in Wood Green. 7.1.19 The Council will support the provision of additional health facilities and will work with NHS Haringey and other service providers to ensure the borough has a necessary supply and distribution of premises to meet Haringey’s health care needs. Further information on health infrastructure is set out in Appendix 4 Infrastructure Delivery Plan. 137 138 7.1.20 Based on the most recent GLA population projections (2010), the primary care needs expressed as the number of GPs associated with the predicted population growth in Haringey is approximately 12 GPs between 2010 and 2026. Eight of these GPs will be required in the north east and south east collaborative areas. The population growth is highest in the north east and south east areas which are identified in SPs 1 and 2 for future housing growth such as Tottenham Hale, Northumberland Park, Tottenham High Road, and Seven Sisters. The GP numbers associated with growth in these areas equate to approximately eight GPs, two of which relate to the Tottenham Hale ward. Assessments based on actual numbers of GPs operating in the borough indicated that there is an oversupply of GPs in three of the collaboratives. However, there is a small deficit in GP numbers in the southeast of the borough. Based on GLA projections (2010), and assuming that the number of existing GPs stays the same; this deficit will increase to six GPs by 2021. Neither the local NHS nor the Council have powers to redistribute GPs from oversupply areas to less well-served ones. However, the imbalance in supply in the south east, the need to modernise some of the GP premises, age profile for GPs, emerging new health models, and predicted housing growth in areas identified in the Local Plan, requires the NHS to plan ahead for service provision, including encouraging growth in supply in relevant areas. The Council and the local NHS are committed to ensuring health provision (accessible services and buildings) that deliver good and improving quality standards and health outcomes that reduce health inequalities and meet the needs of the growing population in Haringey, especially in the identified growth areas, Tottenham Hale and Haringey Heartlands and in areas which are under-doctored, and where future growth is anticipated. 7.1.21 The NHS estate is facing a radical overhaul. New models of service delivery are still developing. Assessment of health needs and service delivery are currently being quantified by NHS North Central London. Options under development include the mix of re-developed and new primary care facilities and resource centre/s for local public health services and appropriate hospital and community care delivered closer to home. The NHS is planning continued expansion of general practice capacity and re-development of primary care premises especially in the eastern part of the borough for reasons mentioned above. The capacity increase will also consider the extension of the role of some practices that are procured to supply care in general practice settings previously provided in hospital settings due to changes in health technology and clinical practice. The most up-to-date primary care and community care related schemes which are being considered by the NHS are included in Appendix 4. The Council will work with the NHS to keep growth trends and the corresponding needs for health services under review as part of monitoring the Local Plan, the Infrastructure Delivery projects, and appropriate Health Plans, and will utilise the monitoring of outcomes in shaping future services in Haringey. 7.1.22 In light of current uncertainties related to health requirements, the Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) investigated the requirements associated solely with meeting the primary care needs of the net new population. Estimates from the IDP show potential requirements associated with high and low net population growth scenarios for the period 2006-2016 as equating to 6-8 new GPs by 2016/17. Impacts of the built and natural environment on physical and mental wellbeing 7.1.23 In addition to the provision of health services, the built and natural environment plays a key role in encouraging children, young people and adults to engage in more physical activity, play, recreation and sports. This could lead to improved physical and mental health, reduced segregation and isolation, and prevent long-­ term illness, such as obesity and associated diseases. Spatial planning can also reduce and mitigate adverse impacts on health, by managing noise and air pollution, and designing walking routes and cycle lanes. 139 7.1.24 As detailed in SP1 Managing Growth, a concentration of new homes will be built in Tottenham Hale and Haringey Heartlands and other sustainable locations throughout the borough. The rate and pattern of this development and population change will impact on the health and well-being of new and existing residents and on the demand for health services. The NHS will work in partnership with the Council to explore how spatial planning interventions might influence the wider determinants of health and result in positive health outcomes. 7.1.25 Housing quality and the environmental quality of neighbourhoods are significantly and independently related to people’s selfrated mental health. Poorly designed housing can have a considerable impact on physical and psychological health and well-being. Overcrowding, for example, is a particular problem in some parts of the borough and affects the health of both children and adults. Haringey’s Housing Needs Assessment 2007 identified that 8.9% (8,311 homes) of households in the borough are overcrowded. The wards which experience the highest occurrence of overcrowding include Seven Sisters and White Hart Lane, with nearly 20% of households. The wards least likely to experience overcrowding include Fortis Green and Muswell Hill. The highest proportion of overcrowding was more likely to occur in the social rented sector than in owner occupied households, with 15% of these social rented homes being overcrowded. Additionally, it was found that households with children were most likely to be overcrowded, particularly lone parent households (30.7%). Overcrowding contributes to the spread of infectious diseases and can adversely affect personal relationships and mental health. Damp housing exacerbates respiratory disease, while accidents are also more likely in poorly designed and poorly maintained homes. Homelessness and poor quality housing may lead to mental ill health and may increase the likelihood of substance misuse. 7.1.26 The needs of Haringey’s ageing population will be a major consideration in planning for the borough in the next 15 years. The fexible and appropriate design of housing, community facilities and public realm and improving accessibility, will allow older people to live healthier and independent lives. 7.1.27 An effcient transport network has positive effects on health by enabling access to recreational amenities, social networks, health services, education and employment. However, car use, in particular, can have a negative impact on health by contributing to air pollution, causing road traffic injuries, reducing physical activity levels, increasing noise pollution, contributing to community severance, and increasing levels of stress and anxiety. 7.1.28 Air pollution can have a detrimental impact on health, aggravating existing heart and lung illnesses. In addition, anticipated climate change in London will make air pollution worse as a result of hotter, drier weather. The whole borough is an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA), and has particularly high levels of pollution from nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. The dominant source of air pollution in Haringey is road transport, with a variety of other sources contributing to emissions. An Air Quality Action Plan has been produced, setting out measures to reduce air pollution emissions in the borough. SP7 Transport explains our approach to improving air quality through transport measures. The Development Management Policies will explain how we will expect developments to reduce their impact on air quality. Further guidance is also provided in the Sustainable Design and Construction SPD. 7.1.29 Access to open space, design of the public realm, access to employment, health and community facilities, and measures addressing deprivation and supporting community cohesion all have a signifcant impact on both physical and mental health. Accessible open and green spaces allow opportunities for physical exercise which can reduce stress, obesity and other cardio-­ vascular diseases. Lack of, and barriers to employment opportunities can affect people’s health and cause people to feel isolated. Employment programmes and mixed use development improves access to and opportunities for employment. 7.1.30 Health Impact Assessments (HIA) consider the potential impacts of planning policies and decisions on health and health inequalities. They identify actions that can enhance the positive effects and mitigate or eliminate the negative effects of developments. Health impacts should be considered at the very outset of developing planning proposals or strategies to ensure positive health outcomes. There are several tools available for assessing the impacts of a development. Health can be integrated into statutory assessments such as a sustainability appraisal, environmental impact assessment, or a separate health impact assessment can be undertaken. For further information please see the Mayor’s Best Practice Guidance on Health Issues in Planning. 140 141 *Haringey Markets* Healthy Eating and Physical Activity 7.1.31 Participation in physical activity and sports promotes health and well-being. It is vital in developing children’s play, exercise and social skills. Haringey’s close proximity to the Olympic Games site provides opportunities for increased participation, and access to high standard sports facilities, as well as regeneration benefits such as jobs and leisure facilities. 7.1.32 Obesity is a major risk factor for the future health of children as it can lead to complications such as heart disease, diabetes, joint problems and emotional problems. Data from 2008 shows high levels of obesity in children across the borough. Of those measured, 17.3% were classified obese and a further 13.2% were classified as overweight. These trends are higher in boys than in girls and there is a large variation across the borough with the highest in the east. 7.1.33 An assessment undertaken by the NHS in conjunction with University College London Institute of Child Health identified wards with the highest prevalence of child obesity broadly corresponded to those with a higher density of fast food outlets and a lower density of open spaces. The improvement of town centres in Haringey is addressed in SP10 and improved access to open space is dealt with in SP13. 7.1.34 Adult obesity is estimated at 17.9% in Haringey compared to 18.4% for London and 23.6% for England. The estimates vary considerably from less than 10% in Highgate to greater than 25% in Tottenham Hale, West Green, White Hart Lane, Bruce Grove and Northumberland Park. 7.1.35 Increased physical activity, including walking and cycling, is beneficial to health and protects against the risk of cardiovascular disease. Access to sport, recreation facilities, play facilities and open space all help to encourage active lifestyles. 7.1.36 Sport England identifies a correlation between adult obesity and participation in sport and recreation and the health benefits of improvements to open space. Figure 6.4 shows the deficiency in public open space and can identify targeted interventions. The 2006 Haringey Resident’s Survey reported on the numbers of residents undertaking at least 30 minutes of moderate to intense physical activity on three or more days per week. It found that approximately 40% of the population did not achieve the required level of physical activity. 142 INDICATORS Monitoring 7.1.37 SP14 will be monitored regularly to ensure effective delivery of its aims and objectives over the life of the Local Plan. The Authority Monitoring Report will be used to assess the performance of the policy, measured using a list of indicators as set out in Appendix 3. The key infrastructure which will support the delivery of SP14 are set out in Appendix 4 (Infrastructure Delivery Plan).

It is home to almost 230,000 people, with significant African, African-Caribbean, Greek and Turkish, Cypriot and Asian communities as well as people from a range of other minority and ethnic groups, including recent refugee and asylum seeker communities. Together they make Haringey one of the most diverse boroughs in London and the UK, with over 190 languages spoken locally. 7.2.2 As the objective in Section 1 sets out, the Council wishes to ensure that community, cultural and leisure facilities are provided to meet local needs. As such, SP15 sets out Haringey’s continued approach to protecting and fostering inclusive communities by supporting the borough’s cultural heritage. *Banksy, Tottenham* SP15: CULTURE AND LEISURE The Council will safeguard and foster the borough’s cultural heritage and promote cultural industries and activities through: 1. Protecting the established Cultural Quarter at Wood Green and the development of further cultural quarters, where appropriate, through Area Action Plans. 2. Supporting the provision of new work spaces and social and cultural venues in all areas of the borough that support all formal and informal cultural and leisure activities; 3. Protecting and enhancing, where feasible, existing cultural facilities and access to cultural heritage throughout the borough. The Council will safeguard and foster the borough’s existing recreational and sporting facilities through: - The protection and enhancement of sporting and leisure facilities in areas of deficiency; and - The dual use of the borough’s cultural assets, such as land and buildings to meet the needs of local communities, for example meeting space, arts and leisure activities, opportunities for recreation and sport. 144 Arts and cultural facilities 7.2.5 There are nine libraries located throughout the 145 7.2.3 Haringey is keen to develop and build on its visitor and cultural destinations within the borough, ensuring that they continue to attract visitors from within the borough and beyond. The Council’s Sustainable Community Strategy seeks to improve and create places of enjoyment, culture and interest. The borough boasts many cultural attractions such as Alexandra Palace, Bruce Castle Museum, Bernie Grant Arts Centre and Tottenham Hotspur Football Club at White Hart Lane. In 2011 the Time Out website listed Bruce Castle as one of the top 101 attractions in London. The predominance of retail in the borough ensures an attractive shopping and leisure experience for both residents and visitors alike. Haringey is home to a vibrant, attractive and accessible network of town centres and retail facilities (further reflected in SP10 Town Centres). These cater for people’s day to day needs as well as functioning as places to spend leisure time, for example, Muswell Hill and Crouch End have a multitude of boutiques and gift shops while Green Lanes has become a well known destination for Turkish and Mediterranean food. 7.2.4 The Lee Valley Park provides a range of cultural, leisure and recreational activities and opportunities for both residents and visitors, for example Tottenham Marshes serves as both a regional open space resource and a local open space for community events and festivals. The Waterside Centre at Stonebridge Lock on the River Lee provides opportunities for community recreation and water sports. Markfield Park and the Markfield Beam Engine and Museum are located in the Seven Sisters ward of the borough. The park is an underused resource and the listed Victorian pumping station has the potential to be developed into a significant visitor destination, with links to the River Lee offering leisure amenity links. The Council will work in partnership with the Lee Valley Regional Authority in relation to the leisure and recreation opportunities on offer for both residents of the borough and visitors. borough, in addition to a mobile library and a Housebound service catering for the numerous and diverse requirements of residents. The libraries offer a wide range of activities including author and music events. Most of the libraries have dedicated space in order to facilitate the exhibition of works of local artists. 7.2.6 Haringey’s first commercial art gallery - The Original Gallery - located in Hornsey Library, shows work from a mixture of established and emerging artists. Jacksons Lane (Arts Centre and Theatre) Community Centre in Highgate is in a converted red brick church on the corner of Archway Road and Jacksons Lane. It offers an extensive range of stage based activities for all age groups, for example dance, drama and music performances, cafe /bar facilities and the opportunity to hire both theatre and studio space. 7.2.7 A key priority included in the Council’s Regeneration Strategy People, Places & Prosperity (2008) is the redevelopment of Hornsey Town Hall as a cultural landmark in Crouch End. It is anticipated that the redevelopment will include community/ cultural/arts facilities in the main town hall with residential development at the rear of approximately 100 units. Cultural Quarters 7.2.8 In Shaping Places in London through Culture (GLA 2009), “culture” is defined as ‘... An engine for communities through recreation, celebration and stimulation, as well as the social glue which can bring people together, enhance people’s quality of life and health, provide education and training, and bring economic benefits such as tourism, to an area’. 7.2.9 The London Plan defines Cultural Quarters as areas where a critical mass of cultural activities and related uses are emerging, usually in historic or interesting environments. They can contribute to urban regeneration. There is considerable scope for growth in the leisure, cultural and visitor economy sectors, with scope for encouragement of cultural quarters in Outer London – particularly in town centres, the promotion, diversification and tighter management of the night time economy and possible potential for very large-scale commercial leisure facilities. *Bernie Grant Arts Centre, Tottenham* Wood Green Cultural Quarter 7.2.10 The cultural quarter at Wood Green is dominated by the Chocolate Factory, a former Barratt’s sweet factory, now a complex of 80 artist studios and small business units, with more than 100 creative individuals and organisations. It is north London’s largest creative enterprise centre. The Wood Green Cultural Quarter is expanding further with the potential for growth as Haringey Heartlands develops. Further detail will be provided on the development of this Cultural Quarter through the Wood Green Area Action Plan. 7.2.11 Over the life of the Local Plan and as subsequent Local Plan documents come forward, there may be the potential to promote the development of additional Cultural Quarters to accommodate new arts, cultural and leisure activities, enabling them to contribute more effectively to regeneration at the following areas: Tottenham Green Cultural Quarter 7.2.12 There are several important cultural destinations around Tottenham Green, including Bruce Castle Museum, the Bernie Grant Arts Centre and the Marcus Garvey Library, all providing strong links to both the culture and heritage of the borough. However, the connection between the public realm, the cultural buildings and their activities and service provision is currently not fully optimised, with little opportunity for the wider public to engage with the green space or adjoining buildings. 7.2.13 There is the potential to strengthen the identity of these assets, link up and enhance service provision and make significant improvements in public open space including its programming and management, streetscene and community safety. There is also the potential to establish a cultural quarter to provide a coordinated strategy for maintaining and enhancing the existing cultural and associated uses located in and around Tottenham Green. 7.2.14 The development of a cultural quarter could contribute to the aims and objectives of the wider regeneration of Tottenham providing an important link between the other regeneration strategies in the area such as the Seven Sisters Corridor within the former New Deal for Communities area. Harringay Green Lanes 7.2.15 Harringay Green Lanes District Centre provides for a rich diverse community with a thriving evening economy and good range of restaurants. Within the centre itself many of the shops are independently run by members of the Turkish and Kurdish communities. Over the life of the Local Plan there is the potential to create a cultural quarter around Harringay Green Lanes strengthening the identity of the area and building on its diverse community. Hornsey Town Hall 7.2.16 Hornsey Town Hall and its associated buildings are located in a prominent position with The Broadway (A103) adjacent to the prime retailing thoroughfare of the Crouch End District Centre. The site is also bounded by residential premises on Weston Park to the north, residential and garage accommodation to the east, Hornsey Library and Haringey Park to the south, residential premises in Hatherley Gardens to the south west and The Broadway’s commercial and retail premises to the west. The Town Hall and associated buildings fall within the Crouch End Conservation Area and the Town Hall is a Grade II* listed building. The Council and the local community place a high degree of significance upon the Town Hall and associated buildings. This is principally due to their architectural importance and the prominent position that they occupy within Crouch End District Centre. 146 7.2.17 The Council’s vision for Hornsey Town Hall, its associated buildings and surrounding area is the creation of an interesting, lively focal point for Crouch End through the creation of an integrated complex of buildings, which promote a viable and vibrant mix of community, cultural, arts, leisure, business and residential uses through appropriate refurbishment and further enabling development. Tottenham Hotspur Cultural Quarter 7.2.18 As part of the wider regeneration of Northumberland Park, there is the potential to create a cultural quarter around Tottenham Hotspur football stadium. Further details on how the Council sees this develop will be set out in the Northumberland Park Area Action Plan. Sports and leisure facilities 7.2.19 Haringey has the fifth highest population of people under the age of 24 years old in London, with 40 per cent within this age range in Seven Sisters alone. Haringey’s Strategic Partnership has placed a strong emphasis on youth, in particular on creating opportunities for young people to contribute to economic and social life and on actions to divert young people from crime. Involvement in arts, sports and formal and informal play can have a positive role in helping to address these issues through providing a sense of self worth, belonging and personal empowerment. Increasing participation in physical activity amongst school children has been identified as a specific priority in light of increasing levels of child obesity. In Haringey, 37% of year 6 children were considered to be overweight or obese compared to 31.3% nationally, with wards in the east of the borough showing higher proportions of overweight and obese children, e.g., 27.2% to 31.9% in Tottenham Green and White Hart Lane wards compared with 4.3% to 7.2% in Highgate, Muswell Hill, Fortis Green and Alexandra wards. *Park Road Leisure Centre, Hornsey* 7.2.20 Celebrating and supporting Haringey’s diversity is one of the key drivers for the Council’s Sports and Physical Activity Strategy 2005. Moreover, participation in sports has been accepted as an outcome for making communities healthier as identified in the Health White Paper: Choosing Health. The Council’s Sports Scholarship Programme aims to produce Olympic stars of the future providing funding, coaching advice and pastoral support to the most talented young athletes in the borough. The programme aims to ensure that at least two of the scholars will compete in the 2012 London Olympics and Paralympics and at least half of them represent their country in their chosen sport. 147 148 7.2.21 The Council operates four sports and leisure facilities at Tottenham Leisure Centre, Park Road Pools, White Hart Lane Community Sports Centre and Finsbury Park Track and Gym. There are six public swimming pools on two sites at Tottenham Green and Park Road Pools, with one other at Northumberland Park Community School which provides restricted access and four primary schools with swimming pools. 7.2.22 The Haringey Open Space and Sports Assessment (Atkins 2004, as updated 2008) identified 15 facilities with large sports halls operated through main leisure providers and secondary schools, with additional provision of 79 community venues or smaller sports facilities across the borough. There are also seven sports halls located outside the borough which are used by Haringey residents, including Sobell Sports Centre in Islington and the Ashmole Centre in Barnet. 7.2.23 In terms of outdoor sports provision, there are a total of 119 clubs identified as operating within the borough. Of these, football is the most popular sport. There are also three full AstroTurf pitches currently in use, all of which are floodlit. These are located at Northumberland Park Sports Centre, White Hart Lane Community Sports Centre and Hornsey School for Girls. AstroTurf pitches are also being developed at Fortismere, White Hart Lane and Highgate Wood. Some 21% of pitch sites are owned and managed by the voluntary sector within Haringey, in comparison with 6% for London as a whole. 7.2.24 However, the Haringey Open Space and Sports Assessment (Atkins 2004, as updated 2008) identified deficiencies and gaps in provision in relation to sports facilities across the borough and the quality of playing pitch provision is uneven within Haringey, for example a lack of accessible indoor football facilities, poor quality and lack of pitches, and ancillary facilities, and a shortage of indoor tennis facilities. Total provision in numerical terms is below the national and London averages per head of population. Some 22% of pitches do not have access to changing facilities and 60% of pitches do not have social facilities. A particular concern is that participation rates in Haringey for outdoor sports are below the national average, which is significant. 28% of football clubs, 30% of cricket club, and 20% of hockey clubs draw more than half their members from outside of the borough. Provision of leisure and sports facilities 7.2.25 Haringey is relatively well served by a range of community facilities and infrastructure. Deficiencies in community facilities are identified in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan from which initial findings show a need for a new district level combination swimming pool and leisure centre to meet the predicted population growth. A prime location for this pool would be the central part of the borough, possibly in Wood Green. Further details are set out in Appendix 4 Infrastructure Delivery Plan. 149 *Park View* INDICATORS Monitoring 7.2.26 SP15 will be monitored regularly to ensure effective delivery of its aims and objectives over the life of the Local Plan. The Authority Monitoring Report will be used to assess the performance of the policy, measured using a list of indicators as set out in Appendix3. The key infrastructure which will support the delivery of SP15 are set out in Appendix 4 (Infrastructure Delivery Plan).

A key part of the Council’s strategy for managing Haringey’s growth is making sure that the services, facilities and infrastructure to support the local community and visitors are provided in suitable locations to meet the increasing demand of our growing population. The provision of community facilities also plays a key role in meeting the Haringey Sustainable Community Strategy priority of improving health and community well-being. 8.1.2 Strategic Policy 16 sets out Haringey’s approach to ensuring a wide range of services and facilities to meet community needs are provided in the borough. For the purpose of this policy, community facilities include education and childcare, health facilities (also covered in SP14), community halls, post offices, places of worship and criminal justice facilities. Libraries, culture and art, pubs and sports facilities are covered in SP15 and parks and open spaces are covered in SP13. SP16: COMMUNITY FACILITIES The Council will work with its partners to ensure that appropriate improvement and enhancements, and where possible, protection of community facilities and services are provided for Haringey’s communities. This will be based on the programming, delivery, monitoring and updating of the Infrastructure Delivery Plan and Schedule which cover projects for: - Health (see also SP14); - Education; - Social care; - Libraries and Museums (see also SP15); - Open Spaces and environmental improvements (see also SP13); - Community and youth facilities; - Play facilities (see also SP13); - Leisure (see also SP15); - Emergency Services; - Transport (see also SP7); - Waste (see also SP6); - Water Supply and Sewerage (see also SP5); - Towards a low carbon borough (SP4); and - Energy and Telecommunication Services. The Council will: - Expect development that increases the demand for community facilities and services to make appropriate contributions towards providing new facilities or improving existing facilities; and - Promote the efficient use of community facilities and the provision of multi-purpose community facilities. 152 Community facilities and development 8.1.3 As Haringey continues to grow and diversify it is vital that we provide the right quantity and quality of infrastructure to ensure that facilities can be easily accessed by all groups in the borough, in line with the London Plan. Promoting cohesion will lie at the heart of our approach to supporting neighbourhoods and communities. To ensure that we continue to meet the demand for community facilities, developments will be expected to contribute to the provision for new facilities, or improvements to existing facilities. This will help to meet the needs of new residents and mitigate the impacts of the new development on the existing community. 8.1.4 Community facilities can provide a range of services in one location, e.g. a community hall can be used for meetings, exercise classes, performances, exhibitions and other uses. As such, grouping facilities together allows a greater number of services to be provided in a single place, makes best use of existing buildings, makes efficient use of land, and encourages links between the facilities and services. Haringey will support multi-purpose community facilities that can provide a range of services and facilities to the community at one location. The Council will also encourage the use of existing community facilities for more than one use, and support the use of other types of premises for community use, i.e. those buildings which already have some public use. The Council and other service providers must work closely together to ensure the services provided are accessible and that the buildings are well maintained. Further detail on provision of community facilities will be included in the Development Management Policies. Providing community facilities 8.1.5 Haringey has a good range of community facilities that are provided by the Council or the voluntary sector. Haringey’s voluntary and community sector consists of approximately 1,400 organisations which employs approximately 5,100 people, and relies on 3,100 volunteers to carry out the services. As well as the important economic impact, the Third Sector has extensive social impacts and benefits for Haringey. The protection of existing community facilities in the borough, the delivery of new infrastructure and assuring that there is no net loss of community facilities will address deficiencies and play a key role in improving the lives of residents in Haringey, in line with the London Plan. The Council will support the community and voluntary sector by enhancing and protecting, where possible, the facilities and premises required. Education and training facilities 8.1.6 Haringey aims to provide a high standard of education and training for everyone through the borough’s network of schools, youth centres and childcare providers (Figure 8.1). We will also work with our partners, such as the further education colleges, neighbouring boroughs and the community and voluntary sector, to ensure that suitable services and facilities for education and training are provided. *Alexandra Palace* *Bruce Castle* 153 *Eden Primary School* Primary Schools 8.1.7 Haringey has a mix of one and two tier primary schools. There are six infant and six junior schools operating with individual head teachers and governing bodies, four sets of infant and junior schools operating as a ‘hard federation’ (one head and one governing body), which is very similar to an ‘all through’ primary school. There are also 43 primary schools that combine and cover the age ranges represented by infant and junior schools. For 2009/10, there were 19,613 school places (reception to year 6). The Council’s Primary Strategy sets out the borough’s aspirations for primary aged children over the period of the National Children’s Plan to 2020. In line with DfE guidance, the Council’s Children and Young People’s Service will seek to provide, where possible, new primary schools of no less than two forms of entry, and will actively support the federation of schools where applicable to help give each school the capacity to meet the borough’s aspirations . Overall, the most urgent need for primary school places has been in Alexandra, Muswell Hill and Fortis Green wards, although this is now being addressed by a decision to expand Rhodes Avenue Primary School by one form of entry. The Council’s Children and Young People’s Service is also responding to the possible impact of emerging legislation on effective school place planning in the borough in the coming years. 8.1.8 It is anticipated that by September 2014 additional school capacity will be required at Tottenham Hale to respond to new housing developments. The child yield assessment for Hale Village concluded that there will be an increase in demand for an additional 60 reception places and 210 primary school places, despite some current surplus capacity across the six local primary schools. 8.1.9 There will be a need to either expand an existing school, or create an additional primary school to meet the demand from predicted new housing growth in Haringey Heartlands. One possibility is the expansion of a nearby school and to expand this school, additional land of approximately 1,500m [2] would be required. 8.1.10 While immediate demand can be addressed, scope for expansion in the north east of the borough is very limited within the schools in Northumberland Park. Redevelopment of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club to include a new stadium and 285 housing units will require the provision of additional school places. 8.1.11 Work is ongoing within Children and Young People’s Service to identify sites/schools that will be used to address the increased demand for school places in the Council’s growth areas. 8.1.12 It is recommended that sites for future primary school expansion or development be identified at these locations to meet demand arising from delivery of housing targets. As the London Plan provides housing growth figures, it is possible that the expansion and replacement thresholds will be reached earlier than anticipated. Secondary schools 8.1.13 The majority of Haringey’s 12 secondary schools range in size from six to ten forms of entry, although The John Loughborough Seventh Day Adventist School operates at two forms of entry. The borough also has a sixth form college, the Haringey Sixth Form Centre. 154 8.1.14 The expected rise in demand for secondary places has been addressed in part by the provision of a new six form of entry secondary school in the middle of the borough, Heartlands High School that opened in September 2010. In addition, Haringey’s Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme is seeing a roll out of more than £200 million on improving our secondary schools and ensuring that they are fit to meet the requirements of a 21st Century agenda. Haringey’s Strategic Business Case (SBC) for BSF sets out how and where we will spend our money. The BSF programme is already well underway, with some of the work completed. 8.1.15 The Infrastructure Delivery Plan in Appendix 4 provides more detail on planned education schemes. *Neighbourhood Resource Centre, Northumberland Park* *Risley Avenue Primary School, White Hart Lane* Higher and further education 8.1.16 In 2009, the College of North East London located in Tottenham Green merged with Enfield College to become the College of Haringey, Enfield and North East London (CHENEL). This is the only College in Haringey. At Tottenham there are over 2,000 full time 16-­ 19 year old students and 9,000 adult learners of which 2,800 are full time. The Enfield site is in the Ponders End area of eastern Enfield which is six miles north of the Tottenham site. The College also offers extensive training in the workplace for 4000 individuals, including apprenticeships, with 500 employers. The College employs over 700 (550 FTE) staff. The College Strategic Development Plan covering the period up to 2013 commits the College to the development of both its Tottenham and Enfield Centres. Haringey recognises the importance of the higher and further education sector and will seek to support its requirements by continuing to work with its partners across the sub-region. 155 156 Facilities for children and young people 8.1.17 Haringey will aim to make sure that children and young people receive the services and support they need by working with our partners, including schools, the voluntary and community sector, parents and carers, and the children and young people themselves. 8.1.18 Haringey’s Childcare Sufficiency Assessment (2008, updated 2009 and 2010) is a measure of the nature and extent of the need for and the supply of childcare within each local area. It helps the Council identify where there are gaps in the market and plan how to support the market to address those gaps. The supply of childcare varies across the borough, both in terms of the number of places available, and in the pattern and combination of types of care. The Council has 17 children’s centres which bring together a range of services for children under five, including family support, health and education. 8.1.19 Child care provision is critical in supporting parents and carers to pursue work, training and education opportunities. While the local authority is not responsible for the provision of childcare, they will provide at least a proportion of child care in the form of free nursery places for three and four year olds (up to 15 hours per week), and longer periods of childcare through the provision of children’s centres. They also have a duty to secure sufficient childcare to enable parents to work or take up education or training. Please see SP9 for more information on how the Local Plan supports schemes that encourage Haringey residents into training and jobs. Facilities for older people 8.1.20 In 2008, it was estimated there were 20,800 people aged 65+, making up approximately 9.2% of the total population (2006 Mid-Year Population Estimates, POPPI). The population of Haringey is expected to increase in age over the next 25 years, to 24,200 people aged 65 and over. By the same year, the number of residents aged 10-39 is projected to fall by 3.4% (3,600 residents), while the number of those aged 40 to 69 years will grow by 22.4% (15,200 residents). 8.1.21 There are a number of strategies and policies that help guide and inform the provision of facilities for older people including Haringey’s Older People’s Housing Strategy 2011-2021, the Assessment of Older People’s Needs in Haringey (phase 1 August 2009), the Older Persons Housing and Support Needs Analysis, the Housing Investment Plan 2009 - Priorities for Older People, and the Commissioning Plan for Services for Older People. The Council will work with its partners to continue to provide more informal services and facilities such as lunch clubs, learning opportunities, exercise classes, networking groups and meeting places. Meeting spaces and places of worship 8.1.22 Haringey has many meeting places, churches, synagogues, community facilities and prayer centres that cater for a range of community organisations and faith and belief groups. The Council will seek to support community organisations and religious groups to help them to meet their need for specific community facilities. 157 *Alexandra Palace* Policing and emergency services 8.1.23 Policing services in Haringey are managed by the Metropolitan Police at a London-wide level and by the Safer Neighbourhoods Team at a local level. There are five police stations in Haringey, with 807 police officers and 147 police staff. The Haringey Metropolitan Police Asset Management Plan (2007) sets out future trends and implications for asset management in Haringey. The new long term provision aims to separate functions which are currently delivered in multi function buildings, as well as a review of back office facilities for command, management and support functions. A potential building near Wood Green has been identified as suitable for these functions. This will accommodate staff currently located in Hornsey, Tottenham and Muswell Hill police stations. Haringey will work with the Police to help deliver their planned improvements once they have been agreed. 8.1.24 The London Fire Brigade (LFB) have no plans for restructuring existing facilities in Haringey as a result of population growth. The LFB will continue to work with boroughs on the need to make adequate provision through the planning system for the provision of suitable facilities for the fire service. The Infrastructure Delivery Plan in Appendix 4 provides more details on the planned policing and emergency services schemes. 158 159 *Home Zone, Linden Road, West Green* INDICATORS Monitoring 8.1.25 SP16 will be monitored regularly to ensure effective delivery of its aims and objectives over the life of the Local Plan. The Authority Monitoring Report will be used to assess the performance of the policy, measured using a list of indicators as set out in Appendix 3. The key infrastructure which will support the delivery of SP16 are set out in Appendix 4 (Infrastructure Delivery Plan).

The policies in the Local Plan and the Development Management Policies document, and for relevant locations, the designations in the Council’s Site Allocations document will provide the framework for these decisions. The Council will also take account of Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs), including planning briefs, frameworks and conservation area statements and appraisals, when determining planning applications. SP17: DELIVERING AND MONITORING The Council will work with Haringey’s Local Strategic Partnership and its sub regional and regional partners to deliver the vision, objectives and policies of this Local Plan. In particular the Council will use the following means: - Development management negotiations and decisions and planning enforcement; - Planning area and improvement plans, planning briefs and guidance; - Haringey Strategic Partnership programmes; - North London Strategic Alliance programme and cross borough working on joint projects; - Infrastructure Delivery Plan and S106 policy including the development S106 tariffs and community infrastructure levy; - The Council’s Capital programme and Service Management Improvement Plans; - Improvements through community involvement and working with the Third Sector via an agreed Compact. Support for neighbourhood and community engagement and empowerment and community behavioural change; - National, London and European Legislation; - London Plan programmes, National Area Growth Programmes, Utility Improvement programmes, European Structural Funds and Homes and Communities Agency Funds; - Private Sector partnership working; and - Monitor the implementation of the Local Plan against the monitoring framework set out in the Council’s Monitoring Framework and Authority Monitoring Report. 161 Working with our partners 8.2.6 In order to ensure the infrastructure is provided 8.2.3 The Council has secured the involvement and commitment of Haringey’s Local Strategic Partnership (LSP) and other key delivery partners to reflect their plans and spending programmes. The LSP recognises that it has an important role to play in relation to the delivery of the Local Plan, in particular in bringing forward the Infrastructure Delivery Plan set out in Appendix 4. 8.2.4 Involving local communities in developing our policies and services is essential to achieving the Local Plan’s vision, objectives and policies. Planning affects everyone - where you live, work, and how you spend your leisure time. As such, involving the community through engagement and consultation is an integral part of Planning. As part of Haringey’s Local Plan, the Council has published a Statement of Community Involvement (SCI) which sets out how the Council will involve all community members and stakeholders on planning applications and development plan production. In addition, the Haringey Strategic Partnership (HSP), including the Council, has produced a Community Engagement Framework which will take a step further, through a common approach that will raise the profile, improve the quality and achieve better co-ordination of community engagement across the agencies that make up the HSP. Community Infrastructure 8.2.5 It is vital that the transport facilities and services, and the social infrastructure needed to make development work and support local communities is provided, particularly in the parts of the borough that will experience the most growth up to 2026. As such, the Council has been working closely with infrastructure providers, delivery partners and other relevant organisations to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is planned, and will continue to do so to ensure that the infrastructure to support the planned growth is delivered. the Council has produced an Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) to provide information on infrastructure needs and provision in the borough. This document aims to identify the new infrastructure that will be required to meet the anticipated growth in demand for services. In the first instance, the Council is focusing on infrastructure requirements up to 2016 /2017 and has used 6,800 housing units by 2016/17 as a baseline for infrastructure needs. Two scenarios have been put forward showing how many additional people could be living in Haringey as a result of an additional 6,800 housing units. The study shows that there could be a population increase of between 4.5 and 6%. 8.2.7 This initial assessment will also provide a basis for estimating future requirements to 2026 given continuation of the initial rate of growth for the forward planning period. On the basis of a firmer foundation for requirements associated with 6,800 housing units to 2016/17 it will also be possible to roll requirements forward to 2026. 8.2.8 The Council’s Infrastructure Delivery Plan schedule (Appendix 4), sets out the infrastructure and services that are needed to deliver the Local Plan and other Local Development Plan documents. The schedule sets out who is responsible for delivery, funding and timescales, where these are known. It also includes a contingency plan where possible, should the amount of growth and locations in the borough vary, or if funding is not secured. The schedule also indicates how the identified infrastructure is linked to strategic policies. 162 8.2.9 While the schedule is detailed, it is not exhaustive of all infrastructure likely to be needed in the borough in the plan period. Other items may be required, as appropriate, in response to new development in the borough or new issues emerging. In many cases, the confirmation of funding for infrastructure is limited to the short term. However, details of medium to long term infrastructure priorities, even where funding has not yet been confirmed, are still necessary to include. To ensure that funding arrangements are fully identified and the proposed infrastructure to support growth are implemented in a timely fashion, the Council has identified a network of service providers to meet regularly to monitor the progress and keep under review the infrastructure needs and delivery of identified projects. This project list will be reviewed regularly to ensure infrastructure delivery meets Local Plan growth requirements and to accommodate any changes to the national and regional framework. *Muswell Hill* 8.2.10 The infrastructure findings will be crucial in this process by helping service providers and the Council to identify infrastructure investment bids, the possible need for financial contributions associated with individual planning applications, and to provide a platform for the development of a charging schedule. It will also provide an infrastructure context for future planning consent negotiations; create a corporate community of stakeholders within the borough to ensure consideration of community infrastructure in future development, planning and policy. In addition, the IDP indicates that all key service providers are interested in opportunities for sharing buildings and facilities. This fits in well with the Council’s own plans for reviewing existing assets and will be further explored through the IDP review and monitoring process. 8.2.11 The Council’s Site Allocations Document will contain further information about the infrastructure requirements of specific sites and areas in the borough that are expected to experience significant development. 163 Development management 8.2.12 Together with the London Plan, the Local Plan will be the main basis for decision making and managing development in the borough. The Local Development Scheme (LDS) is a three year plan, which sets out a programme for replacing the UDP policies with Local Development Documents (LDD). The current LDS sets out a timetable for the production of a number of Development Plan Documents, Supplementary Planning Documents and Area Action Plans (please see the current LDS for further detail). The Local Plan is the key document, to which all the other Local Plan documents relate. In order to manage development and make decisions on planning applications, it is supported by the Development Management Policies, Sites Allocation Document, and the Sustainable Design and Construction SPD. For the borough’s strategic growth area at Tottenham Hale and Areas of Change at Northumberland Park, Tottenham High Road Corridor and Wood Green Metropolitan Town Centre, Area Action Plans will provide more detailed guidance on sites, in order to guide and manage new development. The Council’s policies on waste will be implemented through the North London Joint Waste Plan being produced by Barnet, Camden, Enfield, Hackney, Haringey, Islington and Waltham Forest Councils. Planning obligations 8.2.13 The Council will expect developers to contribute to the reasonable costs of new infrastructure made necessary by their development proposals through the use of planning obligations and its replacements, such as the Community Infrastructure Levy. The Council will use planning obligations (sometimes known as legal agreements or S106 agreements) in appropriate circumstances and in accordance with Government policy and legislation, to influence the nature of a development or mitigate for its potential effects. A planning obligation can be used where it is: - Necessary to make the development acceptable in planning terms; - Directly related to the development; and - Fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the development. 8.2.14 The Council will assess each application individually and on its merits to determine if a planning obligation is needed and what matters it should address. This will include those relevant adverse impacts that might arise as a result of the development including those on the environment, transport, local economic conditions, social, recreational, health, educational, emergency services, and community facilities. 8.2.15 The Council will ensure that a section 106 agreement will only be entered into where planning conditions cannot be used to overcome problems associated with a development proposal. 8.2.16 For Planning Obligations the Council will prioritise its needs including the following: - Affordable Housing; - Transport; - Environmental and public realm improvements; - Community facilities and services including education, health and open space and policing facilities; and - Employment and skills training 8.2.17 Planning obligations can take different forms and can involve financial contributions or the provision of certain requirements ‘in kind’. In considering planning obligations, the Council will take into account economic viability, the full range of benefits provided by a development and the extent to which it contributes towards delivering the objectives of this Local Plan and other planning policies. Pooled contributions will be used when the combined impact of a number of schemes creates the need for related infrastructure or works. 164 Community Infrastructure Levy 8.2.18 Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL), which came into force through the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations in April 2010, is a new tariff which the Council will apply to qualifying development. The planning obligations under Section 106 will be scaled back from 2014 onwards only to be used for the mitigation of impacts which arise directly from the proposed development. Affordable housing obligations will continue to be covered by Section 106. 8.2.19 The Council adopted a Community Infrastructure Levy charging schedule in July 2014. CIL will be closely linked to the infrastructure provision as set out in Appendix 4 of the Local Plan. 8.2.20 In setting its rates, the Council has taken into account various factors, including the potential effect of CIL upon the economic viability of development.. The Mayor for London’s CIL for Crossrail came into effect on 1 April 2012 and the Council is a charging authority. The rate for Haringey is £35 per sq/m. 8.2.21 The Council monitors the Section 106 negotiations and agreements, and the outcomes are reported in the Authority Monitoring Report. The Council will develop a CIL monitoring system. The Council will also meet service providers regularly to monitor the progress of infrastructure projects and keep under review the infrastructure needs. The Council will also ensure that a process and timetable for delivery of infrastructure remains in place and contributions are monitored and distributed as developments are implemented. Greater London Authority (GLA) 8.2.22 In September 2010, the Council adopted the Borough Investment Plan (BIP), which set out its key spatial and thematic priorities for housing led regeneration in the borough. A key priority of the BIP is to build balanced communities through tackling the inequalities in tenure and deprivation between the east and west of the borough. It also supports the Council’s Housing Strategy and Sustainable Community Strategy by seeking to maximise housing supply, improve existing stock and ensure long term sustainability. 8.2.23 While the funding and investment opportunities highlighted in the BIP have changed and new delivery models introduced (e.g. Affordable Rent) the evidence and principles underlying the spatial and thematic priorities remain. Consequently the BIP remains a fundamental informative in terms of housing and regeneration in the borough. Cross boundary working 8.2.24 The Council is working with neighbouring boroughs and the wider north London sub-­ region to ensure that Haringey’s Local Plan takes accounts of their plans and programmes as well as the spending and delivery plans of regional bodies such as the LDA and TfL. 8.2.25 Haringey works closely with neighbouring boroughs to ensure a consistent approach is taken in relation to growth areas and town centres which straddle borough boundaries. As such, discussions have taken place with Hackney in relation to the redevelopment of Woodberry Down, and with Enfield and Waltham Forest in relation to Central Leeside. In addition, we jointly commissioned and prepared a sub-regional Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) with the seven boroughs in the north London housing sub region; and we are currently involved in the preparation of a joint Waste Plan with the six other boroughs in the north London Waste Authority (Barnet, Camden, Enfield, Hackney, Islington and Waltham Forest). Please see to SP2 and SP6 for further detail. 8.2.26 Haringey is also working with the GLA, LDA, TfL, NLSA and the London boroughs of Enfield and Waltham Forest to develop and implement solutions to cross boundary issues which affect the Upper Lee Valley growth corridor in the next 15 years. 165 Monitoring and Review 8.2.27 Monitoring is a key component of the new planning system. Local Plans must set out clear arrangements for monitoring the effectiveness of policies in meeting plan objectives. Under Section35 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, as amended by Section 113 of the Localism Act 2011, planning authorities are required to prepare an Authority Monitoring Report (AMR). Local Plans need to be reviewed regularly to assess how well their policies and proposals are being implemented and to ensure that they are up to date. Monitoring provides the objective basis necessary for such reviews. The monitoring targets and indicators set out in Appendix 3 will be used to monitor the delivery of each strategic policy. The indicators have been specifically selected to address every policy as far as possible. All indicators and targets will be subject to periodic review through the Annual Monitoring process. Each year the Council’s AMR will: - Assess the performance of the Local Plan policies and other policy documents, as set out in the Council’s Local Development Scheme; - Set out the Council’s housing trajectory; - Identify the need to reassess or review any policies or approaches; - Identify trends in the wider social, economic and environmental issues facing Haringey; and - Make sure the context and evidence behind our Local Plan is still relevant. - Monitor community infrastructure provision as set out in the Council’s Infrastructure Delivery Plan. 8.2.28 The process of annual monitoring will enable the Council to assess whether or not the objectives of the Local Plan are being met. If it is found that objectives are not being met, and the Council has explored the identified risk and contingency plans, then the Council may seek an early review of the relevant strategy policy. 8.2.29 The Council has a commitment to monitor the amount of growth in Haringey and identify any potential impact on services. We will continue to work with our partners to ensure the critical infrastructure and services to support new growth are provided. The progress in delivery of infrastructure projects will be reviewed together with the Authority Monitoring Report. The Council will meet service providers regularly to keep under review the infrastructure needs and monitor the progress of infrastructure projects. The schedule and its updated versions will also be considered as key evidence for future Development Plan Policies where the requirement for infrastructure, and priorities, will be reviewed in relation to the policies it supports. INDICATORS Monitoring 8.2.30 SP17 will be monitored regularly to ensure effective delivery of its aims and objectives over the life of the Local Plan. The Authority Monitoring Report will be used to assess the performance of the policy, measured using a list of indicators as set out in Appendix 3.

In addition to supporting proposals that intensify the use of existing employment sites, the Local Plan identifies a number of locations where employment-led, mixed use redevelopment is promoted to secure the renewal or reconfiguration of existing floorspace to provide higher quality modern employment floorspace better tailored to meeting local Table 3.2: Employment Trajectory needs. These sites are set out in the Table below. An indicative employment floorspace capacity for each site is also shown; however it is recognised that these figures are indicative and are gross floorspace. The actual amount of floorspace (gross and net) will depend on the floorspace to be retained and reconfigured, the achievement of the maximum employment floorspace on existing employment sites having regard to the proposed overall mix, site layout and constraints, and viability. |Development Plan Document|Site Allocation Reference|Site Allocation Address|Indicative Employment Floorspace|6-10 years (2016/17- 20/21)|11-15 years (2021/22- 2025/26)| ||||||| |Site Allocations DPD|SA5|LBH Civic Centre|2,156m2||2,156m2| ||SA6|Green Ridings House|1,855m2||1,855m2| ||SA8|Station Road Offces|4,823m2||4,823m2| ||SA17|North of Hornsey Rail Depot|980m2|980m2|| ||SA18|Wood Green Cultural Quarter (north)|3,061m2||3,061m2| ||SA19|Wood Green Cultural Quarter (south)|12,243m2|12,243m2|| ||SA20|Wood Green Cultural Quarter (east)|4,285m2||4,285m2| ||SA21|Clarendon Square Gateway|6,734m2|3,367m2|3,367m2| ||SA22|Clarendon Square|700m2|350m2|350m2| ||SA23|Clarendon Road South|5,390m2||5,390m2| ||SA24|NW of Clarendon Square|1,005m2||1,005m2| ||SA25|Land Adjacent to Coronation Sidings|3,015m2||3,015m2| ||SA27|Wightman Road|840m2||840m2| ||SA29|Arena Retail Park|5,390m2||5,390m2| ||SA30|Arena Design Centre|1,386m2|1,386m2|| ||SA31|Crusader Industrial Estate|2,218m2|2,218m2|| ||SA32|Omega Works|1,386m2|1,386m2|| ||SA33|Vale/Eade Road|3,465m2|3,465m2|| ||SA34|Overbury & Eade Roads|4,851m2|4,851m2|| ||SA35|L/b Seven Sisters & Tewkes- bury Roads|490m2||490m2| ||SA38|460-470 Archway Road|1,260m2||1,260m2| ||SA42|Highgate Bowl|616m2||616m2| ||SA43|Summersby Road|784m2||784m2| ||SA47|Cross Lane|1,386m2||1,386m2| ||SA49|Lynton & Park Road|718m2||718m2| ||SA57|Red House|332m2|332m2|| ||SA63|The Roundway|1,940m2||1,940m2| |||Sub-total|73,309m2|30,578m2|42,731m2| 178 |Development Plan Document|Site Allocation Reference|Site Allocation Address|Indicative Employment Floorspace|6-10 years (2016/17- 20/21)|11-15 years (2021/22- 2025/26)| ||||||| |Tottenham Area Action Plan|SS2|Lawrence Road|1,390m2|1,390m2|| ||SS4|Gourley Triangle|6,570m2||6,570m2| ||TG3|Tottenham Police Station and Reynardson Court|1,230m2|1,230m2|| ||BG2|Bruce Grove Station|100m2|100m2|| ||BG4|Tottenham Delivery Offce|370m2||370m2| ||NT3|Northumberland Park North|340m2||340m2| ||NT4|Northumberland Park Estate Renewal|1,550m2||1,550m2| ||NT5|High Road West|4,350m2|2,175m2|2,175m2| ||NT7|Tottenham Hotspur Stadium|730m2|730m2|| ||TH3|Tottenham Hale Retail Park|13,900m2||13,900m2| ||TH5|Station Square North|7,350m2|7,350m2|| ||TH6|Ashley Road South Employ- ment Area|15,300m2|7,650m2|7,650m2| ||TH8|Hale Village|4,000m2|4,000m2|| ||TH9|Hale Wharf|3,200m2|3,200m2|| ||TH11|Fountayne Road|3,900m2||3,900m2| ||TH12|Herbert Road|2,300m2||2,300m2| ||TH13|Constable Crescent|2,300m2||2,300m2| |||Sub-total|68,880m2|27,825m2|41,055m2| |||TOTAL|142,189m2|58,403m2|83,786m2| 179 9.2.2 Policy SP10 establishes a requirement for an increase in retail provision of 23,995m [2 ] Policy SP10 establishes a requirement for expansion of a leisure-oriented local centre an increase in retail provision of 23,995m [2 ] in North Tottenham, and further expansion of floorspace (13,800m [2] comparison goods and the retail offer in Wood Green Metropolitan 10,195m [2] convenience) up to 2026.

The targets and indicators may change over the lifetime of the plan, in response to changes in national, regional or local legislation and policy. The Authority Monitoring Report will use the targets and indicators to assess the performance of each policy. Where monitoring indicates that a strategic objective, elements of the spatial strategy, or specific plan targets are not being delivered, the Council will assess the reasons for any departure and may consider, as appropriate, one or more of the following interventions: - Produce Supplementary Planning Documents to assist in policy interpretation and implementation; - Allocating further land for a specific use or uses; - Releasing land for alternative uses; - Altering boundaries, frontages or designations; - Revising the policies of the plan; or - Re-assessing the planning requirements applicable to specific forms of development. 9.3.2 The key infrastructure which will support the delivery of the Local Plan is set out in Appendix 4.

The spatial plan for Haringey is sustainable in the long term and ensures that the housing and population growth is supported by social, physical and community infrastructure. 9.4.2 The Infrastructure Delivery Plan, which accompanies the Local Plan, identifies service areas where investment will be needed to meet the additional demand from population and housing growth over the next 15 years. It sets the basis for policies for developers’ contributions to meet future need, and highlights, where applicable, the gaps in existing provision and form a platform for funding bids to relevant agencies. The infrastructure plan: - supports the delivery of the outcomes envisaged in the Sustainable Community Strategy; - forms the basis of a tariff system for defining developers’ contribution to infrastructure needs which stem from housing growth; - helps identify the possible need for financial contributions associated with individual planning applications; - informs relevant partners of social infrastructure requirements associated with planned housing development and population growth; and - creates a corporate community of stakeholders within the borough to ensure consideration of community infrastructure in future development, planning and policy. 9.4.3 In Haringey we have collated information and carried out assessment where practical and relevant on the following community infrastructure areas: - Health; - Education; - Social Care; - Libraries and Museums; - Open Spaces; - Leisure Services; - Emergency Services; - Transport; - Waste, Water Supply and Sewerage; - Energy and Telecommunications Infrastructure; and - Community Facilities including youth facilities. (The Schedule below was examined in 2011, it is a ‘live’ document and will be subject to review with further consultationn and confirmation with Service providers.) 192 Key Messages 9.4.4 Our initial findings indicate that Haringey is relatively well served by a range of community infrastructure and facilities. We do not have any obvious major deficits in provision in key areas up to 2016. The Council has worked with key partners to inform the Infrastructure Delivery Plan and the resulting key infrastructure programmes and projects, which are identified in the following table. These ensure that the expectations which are set out are realistically deliverable, especially in this time of economic uncertainty. The Purpose of the Schedule 9.4.5 The Council will maintain an ‘infrastructure schedule’ identifying key infrastructure projects required to support the delivery of the Local Plan. The Council will continue to give appropriate consideration to the level of risk that some of the required infrastructure will not be forthcoming and ways that this might be mitigated or addressed. The implementation schedule identifies contingency planning where this may be required. The Council has consulted with and had regard to, the investment and operational plans of relevant infrastructure and public service providers, ensuring that these bodies recognise their contributions and that the resources required to deliver the infrastructure to support the delivery of the Local Plan have been given due consideration and have a realistic prospect of being provided in the life of the Local Plan. 193 |Contingency Planning Required?|HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE|Contingency plan based on identifying appropriate sites.

          "content": "Setting the Scene 2.1 The Council’s new Local Plan will set out policies and guidance for the development of the borough over the next 15 years, from the date of its adoption. 2.2 The Local Plan sets out the Council’s proposed vision, objectives and spatial strategy. It includes place-based strategies, site allocations and policies which support the delivery of the Plan’s vision and objectives and spatial strategy. It identifies where development is expected to take place and how places within the borough may change. 2.3 The role of the development plan is to guide decision making on planning applications and inform investment in social and physical infrastructure.The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 requires that “... for the purpose of making any determination under the planning Acts, the determination must be made in accordance with the plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise”. 2.4 This Local Plan is in accordance with national policy by applying a presumption in favour of sustainable development and the policies contained within it show how this is expressed locally. The Council will ensure that planning applications that accord with policies in the adopted Local Plan and the London Plan will be approved without delay, unless material considerations indicate otherwise. 2.5 The Local Plan has been prepared within the context of a hierarchical framework of planning legislation and policy for England. At the top of the hierarchy are a number of planning related Acts of Parliament and Statutory Instruments, the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 (NPPF) which sets out Government’s planning policies for England and how these should be applied, and the Planning Practice Guidance (PPG). Local authorities must take the NPPF into account when preparing Local Plans. This means in practical terms that the Council should follow national policy unless there is local evidence and circumstances that would justify a different approach. 2.6 Below national policy sits the London Plan, which is prepared by the Mayor of London. The Greater London Authority (GLA) Act 1999 requires the Local Plan to be in ‘general conformity’ with the London Plan.This means that the Local Plan should be in line with the [London Plan 2021, unless there is local](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/the_london_plan_2021.pdf) evidence and circumstances that would justify a different approach.The London Plan forms part of the development plan for the borough and provides the spatial development strategy for Greater London. 2.7 It is acknowledged that during the lifetime of this Plan, national policies, guidance and other legislation will be published. This may be able to be taken into account during the preparation of the Plan. Generally where this Plan refers to publications that are subsequently superseded by updated policies, guidance or changes to legislation, the updated context will be regarded as material considerations. 2.8 On adoption, this Local Plan supersedes the [existing Local Plan (2018) and the](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/planning/planning_policy/local_plan/local_plan_review) [Twickenham Area Action Plan (2013). The](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/planning/planning_policy/local_plan/neighbourhood_plans/twickenham_area_action_plan) [West London Waste Plan (2015) and the](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/planning/planning_policy/local_plan/west_london_waste_development_plan) [Ham & Petersham Neighbourhood Plan](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/planning/planning_policy/local_plan/neighbourhood_plans/ham_and_petersham_neighbourhood_planning) (2019) will not be superseded by the new Local Plan. Preparing the Local Plan 2.9 Although the Richmond Local Plan had only been adopted in July 2018, commencing a new Local Plan was agreed in 2019 in the context of changes in national and regional policy and guidance, including a revised National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (2019) and changes to the London Plan.The climate emergency and growing population were also identified as reasons why a new Local Plan was needed. 2.10 The ‘Direction of Travel’ public consultation was undertaken during February to April 2020. This was an additional early stage of consultation not prescribed in the Local Planning Regulations, providing the 5",

In addition, the draft Plan has been prepared during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic which caused dramatic changes in the short-term, and an uncertainty about how behavioural and societal change may alter in the medium to long term. A cost of living crisis has brought further pressures on resource and income. Our place in London 2.20 The borough covers an area of 5,095 hectares (14,591 acres) in southwest London. We are bordered by four London Boroughs (Kingston, Hounslow, Wandsworth and Hammersmith & Fulham) and share a boundary with Surrey (Elmbridge and Spelthorne Boroughs). Together with Croydon, Kingston, Merton and Sutton, we are part of the South London Partnership, which focuses on shaping sustainable growth across the sub-region. 2.21 We value our special and unique natural and historic environment. We play a significant role in providing opportunities for recreation, sport, culture and tourism for not only those who live and work in this borough, but also for those from neighbouring and other London boroughs. 2.22 We cannot act in isolation and therefore work hand in hand with communities and local partners. Our partner organisations and agencies include those within the public sector, business, community, voluntary and faith sectors. We also work closely together with neighbouring boroughs as well as the Mayor of London, the Greater London Authority (GLA) and Transport for London (TfL), particularly on issues which cross borough boundaries. The borough today, and what we know about a growing and changing population in the future 2.23 The borough is prosperous, safe and healthy. The borough’s population is expected to grow and change, with an ageing population. A strong driver of recent population growth is natural change (births minus deaths), along with net international migration, according to the boroughwide housing research, with a notable level of net internal out migration to other parts of the UK. The 2021 census revealed population growth had been lower than forecast, and the borough’s population had been growing at a slower rate than the London average, with a 4% increase in the number of residents since the 2011 census compared with an 8% increase across London. The latest GLA projections (2020-based) estimate much lower future population growth, to reach 196,714 8",

We expect that residents move outwards from London, related to life stage 2.27 (family formation due to parenthood, marriage, cohabitation) and affluence (greater wealth) from the private rented sector into owner occupation (first time buyers) and owner occupiers moving into larger family sized properties. Richmond has very high levels of home ownership in comparison to the London average, and has the highest house prices in Outer London. 2.25 A key challenge is to support an ageing 2.28 population and the impacts on adult health and social care provision, for example both paid and unpaid carers. There is a projected change in the age structure of those aged 65+ to increase by 50% by 2039. Understanding how we can support the health and wellbeing of people of all ages is also key.The 2021 census showed Richmond has the third highest levels of very good health in England and the second highest in London, although there are health inequalities between more deprived and less deprived areas such as life expectancy. 2.29 2.26 A large proportion of the borough’s workforce is employed in highly skilled jobs. The borough’s economy benefits traditionally from the presence of outside workers through their spend in the local economy. Although around half of those who work in the borough also live in the borough, there are also strong commuting flows in and out. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on different sectors, patterns of remote working and long-term 2.30 trends is unclear. The connectivity to Heathrow and central London by public and private transport is an asset, and supports those commuting in and out for work. Education attainment levels are the highest amongst the Outer London boroughs, as is gross weekly pay. While overall deprivation levels in the borough are low, there are also pockets of relative disadvantage around 2.31 Castelnau, Ham, Hampton Nursery Lands, Heathfield, Mortlake and Whitton. However, with such a highly skilled local workforce in professional and managerial jobs, a large 9 amount of self-employed, and one of the most entrepreneurial boroughs in the country, there is scope to adapt and face the post pandemic challenges with a strong local economic recovery. The borough’s unique characteristics are an asset, but also a constraint. Richmond is the only London Borough spanning both sides of the River Thames, and the area is interspersed with open space, linked by roads and interwoven by railways. This determines the character and connectivity of the area, as well as the nature of the population and workforce, with distinct variations across the borough. More than two thirds of the borough is protected by either open space or conservation area status. There are open spaces including historic landscapes such as Richmond and Bushy Parks and the Old Deer Park, the River Thames and the River Crane corridors, and other tributaries.The Arcadian Thames landscape running through the borough is the setting of a number of parks, palaces, towpaths, open spaces and places of cultural and historic importance. The area is also one of high archaeological importance. Approximately 4.5 million tourists visit the borough every year, generating an income of £200m. Visitors come to major attractions within the borough such as Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, Hampton Court Palace, the Wildfowl and Wetland Centre in Barnes, the Rugby Football Union at Twickenham and other sporting venues. The Royal Botanic Gardens Kew are one of only four World Heritage Sites in Greater London. The largest town centre is Richmond; there are also four large town centres at Twickenham, Teddington, East Sheen and Whitton and many smaller centres and local parades. The borough is primarily residential in character, interspersed with some locations for commercial and industrial uses, including riverside industries such as yards for building and repairing small crafts. The constraints mean that land values are high and opportunities for new development are limited. Finding space to accommodate needs is difficult, whether it be for jobs,",

The difficulties of finding new sites for affordable housing has exacerbated pressures over time, affecting residents on lower incomes and the most vulnerable in our communities, including rough sleepers and 2.35 older residents. Responding to a changing environment 2.32 In summer 2019, we declared a climate emergency and adopted our Climate Emergency Strategy in January 2020, forming one of the key drivers for change in this Local Plan. We are committed to taking robust action to tackle the local and global threat of climate change to the people and the borough, both internally and in partnership with local organisations and residents. We want to minimise our environmental impact 2.36 by cutting carbon and other emissions, waste and pollution. For Richmond’s long-term sustainability and prosperity, we need to ensure that the borough is prepared for the adverse impacts of climate change, particularly those resulting from extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts and flooding. 2.37 2.33 Official data from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) provides a reliable long term measurement of some of our emissions.The data collected covers fuel use such as gas, electricity, as well as petrol/diesel use in vehicles in the borough. Although it reports direct and energy indirect emissions for the borough, it does not provide a full picture as it does not include emissions linked to flying, or from waste, or from the products we buy and consume. 2.34 The BEIS data shows that carbon emissions from the borough have reduced from 1086.6 kilotons of CO2 (ktCO2) in 2005 to 567.7 ktCO2 in 2020, a reduction of 47.7%. When looking at per capita emissions (the amount of CO2 per person in the borough) we have gone from 6.0 tons per person in 2005 to 2.93 tons per person in 2020, a reduction of 51.6%. In the last 5 years, from 2014 to 2020, 10 total emissions have reduced by 20.4% and per capita emissions have reduced by 19.4%. The majority of these emission reductions have come from electricity usage (57.5% of total reductions since 2005), which is linked to the decarbonisation of the electricity grid and the shift to renewable energy generation nationally. Half of total borough emissions (50.5%) come from domestic sources, which means the electricity and gas use in homes, with 30.3% coming from transport and the rest from industry and commerce. Of domestic carbon emissions, nearly three quarters (76.3%) comes from gas use for heating and cooking, which highlights the importance in improving the energy efficiency of homes in the borough and moving from using gas to heat our homes and towards much wider use of heat pumps and other renewable heating technologies as a source of heating. The challenge to respond to climate change is therefore influenced by land uses and the type and location of new development, but also permeates into many aspects of sustainable place-making – for example through travel patterns, the importance of open spaces, biodiversity and trees, and managing water and waste resources. Biological diversity is the resource upon which families, communities, nations and future generations depend. It is the link between all organisms on earth, binding each into an interdependent ecosystem, in which all species have their role. It is the web of life. Tackling biodiversity loss and conserving biodiversity is now non-negotiable; investing in biodiversity is a strategic investment for our health, wellbeing and daily lives. Urban green spaces are critical habitats to support biodiversity. Although we can seek additional new on-site open space provision as part of larger developments to provide multi-functional benefits for biodiversity, climate change, health and recreation, additional residential development and population growth will likely bring more access pressure to the borough’s parks and open spaces, many of which provide important habitats for protected and other species.

There are four overarching objectives: *Making Richmond green* Campaign and advocate for action on the climate emergency Enhance our natural environment and protect against flooding Council operations to be carbon neutral by 2030 – reduce waste, increase recycling, and continue to improve energy efficiency *Making Richmond safe* Confront crime and antisocial behaviour (ASB) Be the safest London borough *Making Richmond fair* Bounce back from the pandemic Fairer, more accessible, and more inclusive Help young people get a great start in life Look after those who need our help Get active, run events, have fun Invest in the Borough *How we work* Make it easier to communicate with the Council and have your say Run the Council efficiently 2.41 The Plan also draws upon other key strategies produced by the Council. These include the Climate Emergency Strategy, Housing and Homelessness Strategy 2021-26, Active Travel Strategy 2020, Culture Richmond 2021 to 2031, the Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategy and the Prevention Framework 2021-2025. 2.42 We also work together with many organisations and local people in a range of partnerships.

As more of us stayed at home, many have realised the value of our neighbourhoods – places to get our essential goods and services, to relax and meet, to enjoy our leisure time and to appreciate our high quality open spaces. 4.3 Recognising the Council’s role of working in partnership with stakeholders to consider the future of our high streets and town centres amid the changing times, a Richmond Partnership Conference was held in 2021 to discuss unlocking the potential of our centres. The headline outcomes discussed included the need for town centres and high streets to be destinations beyond shopping to attract and retain visitors, as people centred places 4.7 that are appealing to pedestrians. The conference was followed by a series of virtual Community Conversations within each area of the borough. The results of those events have informed the preparation of this Local Plan. 4.4 The Mayor of London has set out a missions-based approach to meet the most challenging period in recent history in terms of restoring confidence in the city, minimising the impact on London’s most vulnerable 4.8 communities and rebuilding the city’s economy and society following the coronavirus pandemic. One of the nine missions is ‘High Streets for All’, which sets out a clear intent to work with London’s diverse communities to establish new, 4.9 exciting and experimental uses across London’s high streets and public spaces. 4.5 The mission seeks to stitch the essential uses of the city back together, following decades of dispersal and separation and invites us to rethink the way we live and move around the city. It also recognises that thanks to London’s pre-industrial roots 90% of all Londoners live within with 10 minutes of their local high street.‘High Streets for All’ focuses on the vital role that high streets and local neighbourhoods play in the economic and 20 social life of the city, complements the Council’s ‘living locally’ concept, a key feature of the borough’s Spatial Strategy. Unlike parts of central London, which rely heavily on commuters and visitors, Richmond borough needs to plan for and grasp the opportunities provided by more people living and working locally. There is potential to create a more participatory, inclusive and community-focused economy, with shared workspaces that enable collaboration, knowledge exchange and increased business productivity. To ensure we establish and maintain a 20-minute neighbourhood for all parts of the borough we need to build on the momentum of remote working by providing flexible and family friendly local work spaces, and this may also mean reimagining traditional workspaces as centres for collaboration, innovation and enterprise. It is essential that the mix of land uses in the borough are preserved, where the historic patterns of development that have resulted in a mix of uses, such as a small employment site tucked away at the end of a road or a community use right in the heart on a quiet residential corner. These need to be preserved, both within individual areas and on individual sites, to make efficient use of our limited land, enable successful places and reduce the need for journeys. The ‘living locally’ concept relies on inclusive and attractive high streets and public spaces, promoting and encouraging walking, cycling and accessibility for all; this complements the Mayor’s Healthy Streets approach as set out in TP2 of the London Plan. It is recognised that not all residents will be able to comfortably walk or cycle part of or the whole distance to meet their daily needs. People who experience reduced mobility such as older people, people with disabilities, and people with young children require more considered interventions such as an increased number of benches to provide respite, increased use of electric bikes and scooters, easier access to public transport, and supporting more covered bus shelters with seating.

Environmental improvements in the public realm, changing the way we access our high streets to sustainable modes of transport and using local services and shops will help us tackle the climate and ecological emergencies whilst improving air quality, creating green jobs and enabling us to transition to a low carbon society. 4.11 To facilitate the 20-minute neighbourhood concept, the Council will ensure, through planning and other interventions, that local assets, businesses and partnerships are provided that local people want to use and value. This could for example include meanwhile uses and/or temporary leases for premises awaiting longer-term redevelopment, which could provide a range of creative and flexible community uses. Other innovative approaches will be supported by the Council, such as cycle-based local distribution hubs. High streets and neighbourhood centres will therefore not just provide services to meet daily essential needs, but they will also play a greater community, cultural and creative role. 4.12 The map below depicts the borough’s centres, with different shaded buffers applied for 200, 400 and 800 metres. These buffers are applied ‘as the crow flies’ rather than actual walking distances. As a guide, 400 metres is an around 5-10 minute walk.

It shows that residents in Whitton, Hampton and East Sheen are less likely to achieve the active travel target than those living in Twickenham, St Margarets and Richmond. There is a correlation between areas with low active travel levels and areas with both lower levels of public transport accessibility and higher levels of health deprivation and disability.

The Council will also use initiatives outside of planning to target these areas for both infrastructure improvements and community schemes, designed in partnership with Transport and Public Health. Interventions will include improving local walking and cycling routes to schools, town centres, bus stops and local rail stations, as well as softer measures such as school travel planning and promotion of cycling training to local residents.

The Spatial Strategy also sets out how the main elements of the strategic vision and strategic objectives for the borough are to be delivered over the plan period. 4.18 The Local Plan aims to meet the needs of local communities and businesses through the provision of housing, employment, schools, community services, social infrastructure, leisure and other local services, in a sustainable way – following the ‘Living Locally’ concept as set out above in Policy 1 'Living Locally and the 20-minute neighbourhood (Strategic Policy)'. The policies in the Local Plan follow the approach of the NPPF’s presumption in favour of sustainable development.

It identifies for affordable rent a need for 1,123 affordable homes per annum across the borough, and a need for 552 affordable homes per annum for affordable home ownership; the unconstrained figures represent an acute affordable housing need. *Retail needs* : Richmond upon Thames Retail & Leisure Study (Phase 2) forecasts that up to 2034, there is an over-supply of 2,900 sqm gross of retail floorspace, and an undersupply of food/beverage floorspace of approximately 5,400 sqm. Therefore, by 2034 there is a combined under-supply of approximately 2,500 sqm gross. Put simply, the need for shopping space is forecast to decrease but the need to provide space for the food & beverage sector and potentially the wider leisure sector is increasing. There is currently no requirement to allocate sites for major retail development. In the short to medium term there is emphasis on repurposing existing floorspace, with the study finding the existing stock of premises can play a role in accommodating project growth, through vacant properties and growth in sales densities. *Employment needs* :The borough’s Employment Land & Premises Needs Assessment advises the Local Plan should seek to accommodate growth of 60,000 sqm industrial floorspace but recognises there are few options to address this deficit. For office floorspace there is a shortfall",

The *Urban Design Study* provides a boroughwide townscape character assessment, with a deep understanding of the values, character and sensitivity of the different parts of the borough, combined with the reality of future development pressures to assess capacity. It recognises a large proportion of the borough has high sensitivity to change, including the large open spaces and river corridors.There are few areas of lower sensitivity to change. The *Open Land Review* (Green Belt, MOL, LGS and OOLTI) examined the performance of designated open space against relevant national, regional and local purposes and criteria. Much of the borough is covered by these open space designations, which collectively play important roles including preventing the sprawl of Greater London and the coalescence of neighbourhoods, contributing to the character of neighbourhoods and providing green spaces for recreation, nature and associated health and wellbeing impacts. The open spaces also have an important role to play as part of the borough’s green infrastructure network, which is considered more widely as part of other evidence base studies. Land designated as Green Belt was assessed to meet the purposes strongly and all land was recommended for retention. The majority of the MOL has been assessed as performing strongly, with some areas scoring weakly against the MOL criteria. The study has also assessed existing OOLTI, the majority of which meet the criteria for designation.The Study also assessed a number of potential sites for LGS designation, some of which are taken forward as new designations, supported by the Local Green Space Assessment of Proposed Sites. Overall, there are changes to only a small number of existing or new sites as reflected in this Local Plan. 4.21 While we need to plan for more homes and jobs, and the supporting infrastructure, there are limited sites in the borough. We must focus on making the most of our limited land supply. The London Plan’s Good Growth policies seek to make the best use of land, to create successful mixed-use places. The borough’s historic environment and its protected open spaces significantly limit the opportunities for development within the borough. Only one site has been found where exceptional circumstances were considered justified to release from MOL for affordable housing. 4.22 With such limited sites in the borough, the overarching spatial strategy continues to direct major development into the five town centres (i.e. Richmond, Twickenham, Teddington, Whitton and East Sheen), and to support ‘Living Locally’ through the network of local centres, neighbourhood centres and parades spread across the borough, with incremental intensification of existing communities as envisaged by the London Plan. The London Plan directs incremental intensification to existing residential areas within high PTALs or close to stations or town centres. Most new developments are focused on small brownfield sites, with a small number of larger sites identified within the Local Plan and its Site Allocations. 4.23 The Urban Design Study identifies the capacity for growth in the borough using the findings of the characterisation study. The London Plan requires a borough-wide growth assessment (London Plan Policy D1) and sets the expectation for a design-led approach to determine the optimum development capacity of sites. The Urban Design Study sets out an overall development strategy, with the broad areas that form part of the strategy for tall and mid-rise buildings. There are only a few contained areas within the borough which have capacity for tall buildings, within town centres, and/or within previously developed sites, along with some capacity for mid-rise buildings.

The site has a complex planning history. In 2016 outline planning permission was granted for the redevelopment of the site to provide a new college campus, secondary school, special educational needs (SEN) school, Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) Centre, technical hub, replacements sports centre, upgrading of the playing fields and for residential development. The new main college building and two schools have been completed and are now in use. The STEM Centre is yet to be built. An application for detailed consent for the Technical Hub has been submitted, however there is no longer an intention to build this and it is expected that this application (ref. 19/2381/RES) is soon to be withdrawn. An affordable housing contribution secured via the S106 Agreement for the outline permission, should the Tech Hub not come forward, has now been paid. Further to this, a larger residential scheme has also been given resolution to grant planning permission from Richmond Planning Committee (subject to a S106 Agreement) which increases the affordable housing provision from 18% to 50% via 212 units (from 180). On-site parking spaces for 110 cars will also be provided. Detailed consent has been granted for the replacement sports centre, however resolution to grant planning permission from Richmond Planning Committee was recently given (subject to a S106 Agreement) for the retention and extension of the existing college sports hall (which is on the site of the previously intended Tech Hub), and for a new sports hall for the schools on the site of the originally approved larger sports hall, which would have been for used by both the schools, the college and local community. The sports hall will also be available for community use when not being used by the schools/college. Detailed consent has been granted for the upgrade to the sports fields to the south of Craneford Way and it is anticipated that this will be carried out in the near future. Existing building heights range up to five storeys (the main college building) and heights will also go up to five stories in the residential development zone.

The application has been subject to pre-application advice as part of a Planning Performance Agreement with the Local Planning Authority.||| |Description of Current Site Character|Formerly a private estate with a large house in the centre, the highly sensitive site was home to the Military School of Music for over 150 years until the Ministry of Defence released it in 2016. The site was sold to Dukes Education Group, who run a Twickenham-based public school and intend to make the Kneller Hall site the new home for their Radnor House School. There is a live planning application under consideration for their plans. The main building is Grade II Listed, largely dating from 1848 and neo-Jacobean in style. Some buildings were added in the grounds over the years in connection with the music school use, including the Band Room which is a BTM.The coach house, now a guard room, is curtilage Grade II listed and the boundary walls are listed in their own right. Kneller Hall has undergone many changes throughout its history, though whilst the interior has been much altered, the exterior has largely retained its 1848 appearance; the west wing is thought to be one of the building’s oldest surviving parts and has undergone some alteration to its east elevation. The imposing main front elevation faces Kneller Road and lends considerable character to this part of Whitton. The site includes extensive grounds designated as MOL, which include playing fields, with a significant number of protected trees. There are several vehicular access points: two entrances from Whitton Dene and Kneller Road to the west and an additional entrance from the south, also from Kneller Road. On-site parking is provided and has previously provided support for Twickenham Stadium and the Rugby World Cup. A Masterplan Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for the Kneller Hall site was adopted in 2020.||| ||||| 105",

These are managed by RHP, who is the freeholder. They are poorly constructed by modern standards, with poor insulation and damp; they fail to meet minimum space standards; and none of the units benefit from lifts or private amenity space. The estate also includes the Ham Youth Centre and large car park; Ham Clinic; a block of shops and flats on the corner of Ham Street/Ashburnham Street; and public open space Ham Village Green. The buildings are spaced well apart on the site with a significant amount of grassed areas, lending the estate good permeability. There is also on-site parking, including garages, areas of hard standing and two vehicular routes through the estate (Ham Close). The Hill Group has been working in partnership with RHP for regeneration of the estate and submitted a planning application in June 2022 for demolition of the existing flats and creation of 452 new homes (affordable and private); two new community buildings which will replace the youth centre; and reprovision of open space. In September 2022 the Council approved use of Compulsory Purchase Powers to secure the regeneration. The Council is working in cooperation with RHP including through funding support.

Richmond Station lies in the heart of the town centre and is a busy interchange which acts as the gateway into Richmond. Its 1930 Art Deco façade and entrance/booking hall make it worthy of its BTM status, though the side and rear of the building is unattractive and is not considered to contribute to the setting. Late 19th century canopies cover the tracks close to the station. The station building is 2-3 storeys with retail units occupying the ground floor and office space in upper floors. The Urban Design Study identifies the underwhelming sense of arrival at the station and a negative feature. Westminster House is a 5-storey office block with basement gym which is included in the Primary Shopping Area fronting Kew Road. Gateway House adjoins the station to the south, which is a 4 storey office block rising to 6 storeys to the rear where land levels are lower. The site is a Key Office Area and there is an Article 4 Direction which removed permitted development rights for change of use from Class E to residential. The whole of the site is within the Central Richmond Conservation Area.||| 127",

Vehicular access is via Bessant Drive to the west with a servicing along the eastern side, and there is also pedestrian access via a small park off West Hall Road to the south. The site’s boundary treatment cuts it off from the surrounding area, creating almost an island effect. JTP Architects have been consulting the public on a new mixed-use residential proposal for the site.||| |Neighbour Context|The surrounding area is a mix of residential and other uses. To the east the site directly bounds Kew Riverside, a recent mixed-use residential-led development of townhouses and apartments up to 5 storeys. Richmond Medical Group occupies the ground floor of Rose House. Further east is the former Stag Brewery site which is designated in the Local Plan as a Site Allocation suitable for residential development. Planning permission was granted in 2020 for a 4-6 storey specialist extra care facility for the elderly comprising 88 units. Kew Meadows Path bounds the site to the west, beyond which are interwar 2-storey houses and also the Marlborough Trading Estate. 2-storey houses front the residential streets to the north within the CA74. The South Circular Road runs close to the site to the west. Further north is The National Archives.||| 150",

This was emphasised when Richmond Council declared a Climate Change Emergency in July 2019.The Council has prepared a Net Zero Carbon Study to support several policies in this Plan which set out ambitious targets for Richmond. Multiple typologies of residential and nonresidential developments, specific to Richmond, were prepared and assessed to understand what net zero carbon standards could be achieved 16.5 and justifies the policies in the Plan are feasible and deliverable. Planning has a significant role to play in minimising the borough’s contribution to climate change and ensuring that the impacts of climate change can be effectively mitigated. Climate change impacts are increasingly affecting the day-to-day lives of people who live in, work in and visit Richmond borough. The urban heat island effect, flooding events, and extreme weather will 16.6 threaten both our health and wellbeing and the physical fabric of the borough. The Council’s Climate Emergency Strategy sets out five priority areas (air, waste, water, nature and energy efficiency). The strategy outlines how the Council will reduce emissions and the organisation's carbon footprint, including a commitment for the 16.7 Council to become carbon neutral by the year 2030 and zero carbon by the year 2050. This has since been updated by a commitment, with partners across London, to reach net zero carbon by 2043. The strategy also highlights that we will need to provide community leadership so that residents and businesses are able to get involved in preventing and preparing for climate change. Developers, local businesses and residents bringing forward all types and all sizes of development schemes within the borough as part of planning applications, all have a fundamental role to play in helping to meet this target. Therefore, all new development proposals coming forward within the borough should be zero carbon. 185 To achieve this ambitious target, we will need to decarbonise activities across all sectors. This will require a transition to a low carbon and circular economy which promotes the effective use of resources and minimises waste, ensure all journeys are no longer made by petrol and diesel vehicles but instead by zero carbon alternatives such as cycling and walking as well as zero carbon public transport. In addition, emissions from all existing and new buildings will need to be net-zero carbon by minimising energy demand and meeting all our energy needs using renewable and low carbon energy To support the transition to a low carbon future in a changing climate, the Council will shape places in ways that contribute to radical reductions in greenhouse gas emissions; minimise vulnerability and improve resilience; encourage the reuse of existing resources, including the reuse and conversion of existing buildings; support renewable and low carbon energy and associated infrastructure; and take full account of flood risks. Extensive retrofit will be required to decarbonise Richmond’s existing building stock given that low carbon heat solutions require high levels of energy efficiency. The costs of achieving higher standards via retrofit are three to five times higher than for new buildings and the carbon impact of delayed action is significant. Policy 2 Spatial Strategy: Managing change in the borough sets out a presumption in favour of refurbishment. Whilst there will be circumstances where demolition may be more appropriate, in general, because of the substantial embodied energy savings made in repurposing existing buildings, compared with the ultra-high embodied energy costs of demolition and rebuild, the reuse and/or refurbishment of existing buildings is preferred. Using the existing capacity of buildings is economically, environmentally and socially responsible.The reuse or retrofit of existing buildings is also generally more cost-effective and less controversial because it conserves and enhances existing places and neighbourhoods.",

Therefore, all development proposals should apply the Energy Hierarchy, as set out in the London Plan. The priority is to minimise energy demand, and then address how energy will be supplied and renewable technologies incorporated. An important aspect of managing demand will be to reduce peak energy loadings. 16.11 All development (residential and non-residential) should be net-zero, which means that a certain percentage of regulation carbon emissions has to be achieved on-site (see Table 16.1 above), with the remaining emissions (up to 100%) to be offset through a contribution to the Council’s Carbon Offset Fund.The targets are expressed as minimum improvement over the Target Emission Rate (TER) outlined in the national Building Regulations (2021). 16.12 While the London Plan only requires ‘major’ developments to be zero carbon, the majority of developments in Richmond borough are minor schemes for which the London Plan policy would not apply. In order to achieve our carbon reduction target as cost effectively as possible, all new development must therefore be fit for the future (i.e. be ultra-energy efficient and climate resilient, and maximise low carbon and renewable energy). The cumulative impact of all minor developments represents a large source of carbon emissions, and they will play a significant role in becoming a net-zero carbon borough by 2043 at the latest. Development that takes place now will become part of the existing built stock, and if the borough is not moving towards a net-zero requirement for all developments as part of this Local Plan, it would be inevitable for these developments to be retrofitted at a significant cost in the future. Therefore, all development will need to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to near zero on site and become net-zero carbon or net-positive buildings. In addition, given that a significant proportion of non-residential schemes in Richmond are less than 1,000sqm GIA, the threshold of 100sqm has been applied to non-residential schemes to ensure that minor developments also achieve the required emission reductions 16.13 The Council will require an Energy Strategy, setting out an assessment of energy demand and carbon emissions from a proposed development, which should demonstrate the expected energy and emissions savings from energy efficiency and renewable energy measures incorporated into the development. Renewable technologies such as photovoltaic (PV) cells, solar thermal panels, ground and air source heat pumps and other forms of renewable energy are likely to be appropriate in many parts of the borough, subject to other policies within this Plan. There could also be opportunities for other and/or more advanced renewable technologies, such as tidal microgeneration on the River Thames. It should be noted that ground or air source heat pumps are powered by electricity, so unless this comes from a renewable source, they still generate carbon emissions, though less than those associated with conventional types of heating, and with no on-site emissions. Ideally solar PV should be used for the heat pumps to be considered renewable energy. 188",

It must demonstrate how the energy requirements will be met in line with the London Plan’s Energy Hierarchy. The onus will be on developers to pay for the cost of any independent assessment on behalf of the Council. 16.15 The Council recognises that there may be exceptional circumstances where it is not technically feasible for a development to achieve the required on-site carbon emissions reductions. In such cases, the applicant will have to demonstrate in the Energy Strategy the reasons why the target cannot be met on-site. As part of this exercise, applicants should thoroughly explore all measures and potential options because many renewable energy technologies can still be delivered within constrained development sites where there is very limited outdoor space; for example, roof mounted solar technologies and air source heat pumps; air source heat pumps can be delivered within sites where there is only very limited outdoor space. The renewable energy sector is a rapidly growing sector with continuous scientific technological advancements, meaning that the technology is gradually becoming cheaper, more advanced, more efficient, more space saving, and renewable energy solutions can now be delivered within a range of different development types and sites. Any justifiable shortfall in on-site reductions will need to be met through a cash-in-lieu contribution to the Council's Carbon Offset Fund, agreed through a Section 106 legal agreement in line with the Planning Obligations SPD. 16.16 Developments in conservation areas, or those which could affect other heritage assets including their settings, need to provide careful consideration of how sustainable energy measures may be incorporated without adversely impacting on the character, function and preservation of a specific area or asset, in accordance with other policies set out in this Local Plan. There is no one-size-fits-all approach or solution to accommodating sustainable energy measures in the historic environment; however, applicants should not presume that a viable and sustainable solution cannot be found or be provided, especially as technologies are constantly improving (including their visual impact). Ultimately, the merits of a proposal and any potential harm to a heritage asset will need to be considered and assessed on a case-by case basis, as it will depend on site specific circumstances, such as the details of any proposed sustainable energy measure and the significance of the heritage asset. The Council is considering producing further guidance on energy efficiency in historic buildings. 16.17 Future changes to energy efficiency standards will be kept under review and policy requirements will be updated with the prevailing standards if required. The Government’s 2019 Spring Statement includes a commitment to introducing a Future Homes Standard in 2025. This will require new build homes to be future proofed with low carbon heating and much higher levels of energy efficiency. As an achievable steppingstone to the Future Homes Standard, the Government has increased the energy efficiency requirements in Part L of the Building Regulations for new homes. Development proposals will be expected to meet these new standards which are set out in the most current version of the Building Regulations (2021), including transitional arrangements. Whilst Building Regulations have been updated recently and are expected to be updated again in 2025, current proposals for the Future Homes Standard 2025 are not ambitious enough to deliver the savings required to achieve our carbon reduction targets. Therefore, London Plan and in particular Local Plan policy standards will apply until they are superseded by higher national standards 16.18 In line with the current Building Regulations, overheating and ventilation have become important considerations for the Council and accordingly ambitious requirements have been set. Both new build and change of use developments are going to have to consider 189",

The Heat Network Priority Areas and clusters with opportunities for DEN are set out in London Plan Policy SI 3 Energy infrastructure and in the boroughwide Heat Mapping Study respectively. 16.23 Any proposals to develop or connect to a site-wide or district heat network will need to demonstrate compliance with all of Richmond’s climate change policies, be future-proofed and demonstrate that heat losses have been minimised. New development will be expected to demonstrate through its Energy Strategy that the most sustainable heating and cooling systems have been selected. This should include consideration of the proposed system as a whole, including the impact of its component materials on greenhouse gas emissions. 16.24 Minor new-build developments should be designed to be able to connect to a local DEN wherever reasonably possible.

National sustainable design and construction standards, such as BREEAM, ensure that a development’s full impact on the environment, including water use, transport, land use, ecology, as well as energy use and waste are considered and addressed. Using these standards, or any subsequently adopted set of national sustainable construction standards, will assist in the delivery of a number of the policies covered in the Local Plan including in relation to green infrastructure and sustainable transport. 16.26 BREEAM Domestic Refurbishment applies to alterations to existing dwellings, including domestic conversions, change of use projects and extensions; it allows both the extension and the existing dwelling to be included as part of the assessment as necessary. A post-refurbishment stage assessment or review is required in order to confirm the final 'as refurbished' performance of the building; this must be certified after practical completion of the refurbishment works. If a scheme cannot be assessed under BREEAM Domestic Refurbishment (such as where the proposal only relates to minor internal re-modelling work), written confirmation will have to be provided as part of the planning application by an accredited assessor. 16.27 Achieving a rating under the BRE Home Quality Mark is one way of demonstrating the standard of a new residential dwelling. The Home Quality Mark has been designed to ensure the construction of high quality sustainable homes that will meet the long-term needs of occupants, including measures for carbon emissions, sustainable materials, air quality and natural daylight.This scheme allows the sustainability credentials of new homes to be compared more easily, and, where adhered to alongside Fabric Energy Efficiency Standard (FEES) requirements, will help developers to demonstrate compliance with the relevant policies. 16.28 The BREEAM New Construction Standards 2022 scheme (covered by Part C of this policy) can be used to assess the environmental life cycle impacts of new non-residential buildings at the design and construction stages. ‘New construction’ is defined as development that results in a new standalone structure, or a new-build extension to an existing structure. A threshold of 500sqm has been applied to ensure that larger minor developments achieve this requirement. 16.29 A fully fitted assessment will ensure that the fit-out of the development meets the sustainable design policy requirements, including those relating to energy efficiency, water efficiency, and sustainable materials. Fully fitted developments assessed under BREEAM New Construction 2022 must achieve a ‘verification stage’ certification at post occupancy stage, unless it can be demonstrated that this is not feasible. The New Build Verification Stage incentivises project teams to close the gap between the design intent and actual inuse performance of buildings. 16.30 The BREEAM Non-Domestic Refurbishment and Fit-out scheme assesses the environmental life cycle impacts of existing non-domestic buildings at the refurbishment and fit-out stages. The scope of works being assessed must include a full fit-out unless it can be demonstrated to the Council’s satisfaction that the end occupier of the development has particular requirements which necessitate a shell only or shell and core building. The subsequent fitout of the building must upgrade the project to a BREEAM New Construction fully fitted rating and certification; this will be secured via legal agreement or planning condition, as appropriate. It is important to note that the requirement for the final BREEAM rating needs to also be applied to the shell and core or core only developer and not just the final developer as once the final fit out has taken place many of the necessary credits to achieve the required BREEAM rating are no longer available. 16.31 For any BREEAM scheme, if the ‘Outstanding’ rating is deemed not to be feasible, details must be provided to justify this.

A Fabric First approach 16.32 The need to ensure that a building’s energy demand is reduced before seeking to use low carbon energy is widely accepted as one of the key principles of good environmental design. Despite this, there is still considerable progress which can be made to deliver buildings with a truly energy efficient building fabric. This is due to design and compliance methodology issues, as well as construction quality. Material choices are one of the most important considerations for seeking to achieve sustainable homes. The aim is to take a fabric first approach. Essentially, fabric first is about maximising the performance of the building’s structure. This will optimise a home’s energy efficiency and reduce its dependence on mechanical heating and ventilation systems. It is important therefore, to try to source products with strong sustainable credentials, including those made from recycled or reclaimed materials, and consider those which can help deliver the best thermal performance. 16.33 The Fabric Energy Efficiency Standard (FEES) will be applied to new-build residential developments in order to reduce carbon emissions through fabric energy efficiency. 16.34 The FEES have the potential to assist scheme viability because designers will be able to achieve greater energy efficiency by improving building form, in addition to specification, which is likely to be cost neutral or potentially cost positive. Compliance with the FEES levels recommended by the Zero Carbon Hub not only supports carbon reduction, but also long-term energy security and the reduction of fuel poverty for future residents. 16.35 The FEES does not apply to residential developments involving refurbishment and extension; however, these developments are encouraged to maximise energy efficiency through a focus on building form (e.g. for a proposed new extension) in addition to specification, in accordance with the FEES. 16.36 In addition to compliance with the FEES, all developments are encouraged to adopt recognised and successful fabric first approaches such as Passivhaus and AECB Building Standard (previously known as Silver Standard), which go beyond the policy levels, in order to promote best practice fabric energy efficiency. 16.37 It is evident that greener homes are much cheaper for tenants; lower running costs of homes built to today’s environmental standards have the potential to cut bills for occupiers. A family moving from an old, poorly insulated and fossil-fuel heated home into a modern home could save up to £500 per year. Water efficiency 16.38 According to Waterwise, the UK has less available water per person than most other European countries. London is drier than Istanbul, and the south-east of England has less water available per person than the Sudan and Syria. London has lower rainfall than the national average while having an extremely high population density. 16.39 This combination of limited water resources and high demand has resulted in the Environment Agency designating the Thames Water region to be 'seriously' water stressed, meaning that more water is taken from the environment than the environment can sustain in the long term. London's water supply and demand are finely balanced, and climate change as well as population growth will increase the risk of drought and impacts on the environment. Predicted higher temperatures due to climate change and a growing population mean that the borough’s estimated water supply availability (in a dry year) is shown to be in significant deficit. Therefore, high standards of water efficiency will be required in new developments. New developments, in their design, landscaping, construction and operation, should incorporate measures to avoid water wastage. 16.40 The Council has adopted the 'optional' higher national technical standard for water consumption of 110 litres per person per day (including an allowance of 5 litres or less per 194",

All new residential developments including conversions, reversions, change of use and extensions that create one or more new dwellings must meet this target. Development must be designed to be water efficient and reduce water consumption. Refurbishments and other non-domestic development will be expected to meet BREEAM water-efficiency credits. Planning conditions will be applied to new residential development to ensure that the water efficiency standards are met. 16.41 All minor non-residential new build developments and minor non-residential extensions of between 100sqm and 500sqm are required to demonstrate how all credits for Water consumption (Wat 01) would be achieved under the relevant BREEAM scheme. A minimum of 3 credits must be achieved where rainwater and/or greywater recycling is demonstrated not to be feasible, in order to achieve water credits equivalent to an ‘Outstanding’ standard. 16.42 Where a BREEAM assessment is not technically feasible, this will have to be confirmed in writing by an accredited BREEAM assessor; applicants should incorporate best practice water saving and recycling measures as outlined in the Sustainable Construction Checklist SPD. 16.43 A number of water saving measures and equipment may be incorporated into developments to comply with the maximum water consumption levels set out in this policy: There should be full use of water saving devices, water efficient fixtures and fittings. Rainwater and grey water recycling (water butts or more complex collection and treatment systems) can significantly reduce water consumption. Grey water recycling will need to be energy efficient. Landscaping and gardens should be designed to lower water demand. Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), including rainwater harvesting and storage from roofs and other surfaces should be used as they can significantly reduce demand for water.

The WLWP is due for review by 2031. 16.45 This policy seeks to minimise the amount of waste going to landfill and contributes towards the borough being more self-sufficient in dealing with its waste. For example, logistics hubs that support last mile deliveries by electric vans or cargo bikes as set out in Policy 22 could be used to distribute surplus food waste. In addition, the Council considers the layout, siting, function and design of recycling and refuse storage facilities to be an integral part of the development process. As set out in more detail in our Refuse and Recycling: Storage and Access Requirements SPD, proposals for new developments should integrate refuse and recycling within the scheme without causing undue noise and odour nuisance or other impacts on amenity and living conditions. Construction Environment Management Plans are required where development is proposed that uses the river to transport construction materials and waste, in addition to site waste management plans. 16.46 Waste sites should only be released to other land uses where waste processing capacity is re-provided elsewhere within London, based on the maximum achievable throughput of the intended site over the last five years. 16.47 The Council will apply the policies of the WLWP over the lifetime of the Local Plan when dealing with applications affecting existing waste sites, such as the Central Depot in Twickenham, the Civic Amenity site in Townmead Road or any other sites with waste management or treatment facilities as identified in the WLWP. In addition, the policies of the WLWP and the London Plan will be used for assessing proposals for new or additional waste management facilities in the borough. Circular economy 16.48 The aim of a circular economy is to address the problems of resource use by rejecting the take-make-dispose model of production and consumption that has persisted in the past. Instead, waste is “designed out” and materials are kept at a high value for longer through reuse, repair and recycling. 16.49 A more circular economy will: 1. reduce waste, 2. drive greater resource productivity, 3. deliver a more competitive economy, 4. position the UK to better address emerging resource security/scarcity issues in the future, and 5. help reduce the environmental impacts of production and consumption. 16.50 The construction of a development uses energy and resources, which represent its embodied carbon emissions. As buildings become more energy efficient and energy generation is decarbonised, the proportion of operational emissions will significantly reduce and embodied carbon will represent a higher proportion of whole life-cycle carbon emissions. Addressing these carbon emissions are key to achieving UK, London and Richmond Borough targets on net zero. All new build development will be expected to endeavour to minimise embodied carbon in line with best practice targets contained [within the Mayor’s Whole Life-Cycle Carbon](https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/planning/implementing-london-plan/london-plan-guidance/whole-life-cycle-carbon-assessments-guidance) [Assessments London Plan Guidance(2022)](https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/planning/implementing-london-plan/london-plan-guidance/whole-life-cycle-carbon-assessments-guidance) and other latest industry guidance. 16.51 Circular economy opportunities in developments might include using materials with a lower embodied carbon (e.g. timber rather than concrete frame), using more recycled content in the materials and finding other ways to enhance recovery and recyclability (e.g. reinforcement free concrete).

A Circular Economy Statement should demonstrate: 1. how all materials arising from demolition and remediation works will be re-used and/or recycled 2. how the proposal’s design and construction will reduce material demands and enable building materials, components and products to be disassembled and re-used at the end of their useful life 3. opportunities for managing as much waste as possible on site 4. adequate and easily accessible storage space and collection systems to support recycling and re-use 5. how much waste the development is expected to generate, and how and where the waste will be managed in accordance with the waste hierarchy 6. how performance will be monitored and reported. 16.53 The Mayor has published guidance on the [production of Circular Economy Statements.](https://www.london.gov.uk/publications/circular-economy-statement-guidance) 200",

It is strongly recommended that applicants satisfy themselves that their proposals are capable of passing both the Sequential and Exception Tests prior to the submission of an application. 16.58 The Council has adopted its own Sequential Test approach and development requirements for town centres and local centres in the borough. Many of the borough’s properties are located in and around town and local centres. Some centres are located in Flood Zones 2 and 3; however, relocating development away from these centres and their immediate surrounding vicinity is not always a realistic option due to the community role these areas play in the borough. In order to sustain the continuing role of these centres, development can be used as a way to help manage and reduce flood risk in these areas. Therefore, the Council – in liaison with the Environment Agency – has developed a local Sequential Test approach. The local Sequential Test approach is applicable for town centres, local centres, and areas that fall within the 800m buffer boundary for each centre. An 800m buffer was selected as it is considered a community sustaining walking distance for a person not living with/having a physical disability. 16.59 The Sequential Test will not be required if the development proposal meets at least one of the following: It is within a town centre or local centre boundary; It is for residential development or a mixed-use scheme and within the 800m buffer area identified within the town centre or local centre. 16.60 The local Sequential Test approach is also applicable for certain development proposals outside of the requirements above. The Sequential Test will not be required if the proposed development: Is a site allocation in the Local Plan that has already been sequentially tested, unless the use of the site being proposed is not in accordance with the allocations in the Local Plan. Is for the redevelopment of an existing single residential property. Is for a conversion or change of use. 16.61 The Sequential Test will be required in all other cases. 16.62 The onus is on the applicant to demonstrate that the Sequential Test can be passed, and therefore the necessary relevant information needs to be submitted as part of the planning application. It is for the Council to consider the extent to which the Sequential Test considerations have been satisfied. In line with the NPPF and PPG, the Council will refuse applications that fail the Sequential Test even where the Exception Test has been passed. Further guidance and advice can be found in the Council’s SFRA, NPPF and PPG. 16.63 In addition, the Council requires the application of a sequential approach to the layout of sites, whereby it is necessary for the applicant to demonstrate how development and more vulnerable uses have been located in areas at lowest risk from flooding on a specific development site. 206",

Net flood risk reduction includes both on- and off-site measures, including reducing the land use vulnerability by not proposing additional built development within undeveloped functional floodplain, raising of floor levels, reduction in run-off, increasing flood storage capacity, reduced impedance to flood water flow and the incorporation of flood resilient and/or resistant measures. Finished floor levels are to be raised to a minimum of 300mm above the 1 in 100 fluvial or 1 in 200 tidal flood level (whichever is greater), including an allowance for climate change, as recommended in the Council's SFRA in Table 6-1, or to the maximum acceptable height possible below this, should sufficient justification be provided. Opportunities to restore the functional floodplain to its original state / condition are encouraged and will be supported. 16.66 The borough contains a number of islands in the River Thames. Where the access and egress to and from the island begins within the functional floodplain, for the purposes of new development, such islands will be considered and treated as functional floodplain (Zone 3b), even if parts of the islands may be within an area of lower probability of flooding. In line with the guidance set out in the Council’s SFRA, new developments are restricted to ‘Water Compatible’ and ‘Essential Infrastructure’ (subject to an Exception Test) as per the guidance in the Flood Risk and Coastal Change PPG. Flood Risk Assessments 16.67 Flood risk assessments (FRA) will be required in line with national policy and guidance. National policy and guidance, as well as the BSI Code of Practice on Assessing and managing flood risk in development (BS 8533:2011), provide detailed information on the requirements for assessing and managing flood risk in development and how to produce site-specific Flood Risk Assessments. All new development needs to take account of the latest climate change allowances.This should be included as part of the Flood Risk Assessment process. This will help minimise vulnerability and provide resilience to flooding in the future. 16.68 Flood Risk Assessments need to consider flood risk from all sources. In addition to fluvial and tidal flooding, properties and infrastructure within the borough are also at risk of flooding from other, more localised sources, such as surface / groundwater / sewer flooding due to surcharging of sewers and drains or due to the failure of infrastructure. Flooding can also occur away from the floodplain as a result of development where off-site infrastructure is not in place ahead of development (also see Policy 9 ‘Water Resources and Infrastructure’). In addition, a Flood Risk Assessment is also required for smaller development proposals in Flood Zone 1, where there is evidence of a risk from other sources of flooding identified in the SFRA, sources that need to be assessed and mitigated. Flood Risk Mitigation and Resilience 16.69 For fluvial flooding, the finished floor levels for all developments of all vulnerability classifications must be set a minimum of 300mm above the 1 in 100 plus appropriate climate change allowance flood level. For developments impacted by defended tidal flooding, as a minimum all sleeping accommodation must be located on finished floor levels above the Thames Tidal Breach 2100 flood level. This is to ensure development is safe for its lifetime for future occupants and users. Further information on flood risk mitigation and resilience is set out in the SFRA at Table 6-1. 16.70 In relation to flood storage compensation, all relevant development proposals must ensure appropriate flood storage compensation is provided for the fluvial and undefended tidal floodplain (which is riverward of the flood defences).

For the undefended tidal floodplain, to ensure there is no loss of flood storage there should be no increase in built footprint or raising of ground levels as level-for-level and volume-for-volume flood storage compensation is not achievable in this location. If water compatible structures, such as pontoons or slipways, are proposed, they should be designed to minimise the loss of flood storage i.e. by being floodable, hollow structures rather than concrete, solid structures. Sustainable drainage 16.71 These mimic natural drainage patterns to manage rainfall and surface water runoff close to the source. They manage the transport of water and the speed that it runs off hard surfaces before it enters watercourses.They can be designed to store water and control its infiltration into the ground to allow for evaporation and transpiration. 16.72 Developments should reduce surface water discharge in line with the Sustainable Drainage Hierarchy set out in Policy SI13 of the London Plan, and the actions should also be taken in line with the London Sustainable Drainage Action Plan (LSDAP). 16.73 The borough is very susceptible to surface water flooding. Surface water flooding happens when the ground and rivers cannot absorb heavy rainfall and when man-made drainage systems have insufficient capacity to deal with the volume of rainfall. Typically, this type of flooding is localised and happens very quickly, making it very difficult to predict and give warnings. With climate change predicting more frequent short-duration, high intensity rainfall and more frequent periods of long-duration rainfall, coupled with an ageing Victorian sewer system and increasing pressure from growing populations, surface water flooding is likely to be an increasing problem. 16.74 Therefore, to reduce the risk of surface water and sewer flooding, all development proposals in the borough that could lead to changes to, and have impacts on, surface water run-off are required to follow the London Plan drainage hierarchy: 1. Store rainwater for later use as a resource (for example rainwater harvesting, blue roofs for irrigation) 2. Use infiltration techniques, such as porous surfaces in non-clay areas rainwater infiltration to ground at or close to source 3. Rainwater attenuation in green infrastructure features for gradual release (for example green roofs, rain gardens) 4. Rainwater discharge direct to a watercourse (unless not appropriate) 5. Controlled rainwater discharge to a surface water sewer or drain 6. Controlled rainwater discharge to a combined sewer. 16.75 If discharging surface water to a public sewer, developers are required to provide evidence that capacity exists in the public sewerage network to serve their development in the form of written confirmation. See also Policy 9 Water Resources and Infrastructure. 16.76 The Council’s SFRA identified reducing the rate of discharge from development sites to greenfield runoff rates as one of the most effective ways of reducing and managing flood risk within the borough. Greenfield run-off is the surface water drainage regime from a site prior to development. To maintain the natural equilibrium of a site, the surface water discharge from a developed site should not exceed the natural greenfield run-off rate. Where greenfield run-off rates are not technically feasible, applicants will be expected to clearly demonstrate how all opportunities to minimise final site runoff, as close to greenfield rate as practical, have been taken. In such instances, the minimum requirement is to achieve at least a runoff rate of 2 l/s or below, or a 50% attenuation of the site's surface water runoff at peak times, based on the site's performance prior to development. 16.77 Applicants and developers will need to submit evidence, as part of Flood Risk Assessments and/or requirements set out in the Council’s 208",

Therefore, applicants have to submit drainage and surface water management designs as part of the planning process. The satisfactory performance of SuDS depends not only on good design but also adequate maintenance, and provision for adoption and maintenance must be made from the outset. The Council will use planning conditions or obligations to make sure that arrangements are in place for ongoing maintenance over the lifetime of the development. Borough-specific guidance on SuDS can be found within the Council's SuDS Guidance Document as well as in the Council's SFRA. Flood defences 16.79 Development proposals adjacent to flood defences will be required to protect the integrity of flood defences and allow access for future maintenance and upgrading. Development should be set back from flood defences to allow for any foreseeable future maintenance and upgrades in a sustainable and cost-effective way. 16.80 Natural flood management methods, such as those included in the Thames Landscape Strategy’s ‘Rewilding Arcadia’ project, should be employed in development proposals due to their multiple benefits including increasing flood storage and creating leisure areas and habitat. There is the potential to achieve significant improvements when undertaking flood defence work, including improved public spaces, access to the river and the Thames Path, and the creation of new habitats. Development should where possible seek to implement those measures set out in Policy 40 Rivers and Corridors when mitigating flood risk. 16.81 The protection of people, properties and infrastructure from the risk of fluvial and tidal flooding is essential in this borough and the integrity of the flood defence infrastructure must therefore be maintained. Flood defence infrastructure includes formal and informal flood defences and such defences may not always be recognisable and can include mounds, buildings and walls. The Council encourages the return of currently engineered riverbanks to a more natural state where this is possible. The majority of formal flood defences are privately owned, and it is the flood defence owner’s responsibility for maintaining those formal flood defence structures as outlined in the Metropolis Management (Thames River Prevention of Flood) Act 1879 to 1962. 16.82 There is a statutory requirement for the Council to consult the Environment Agency for any development that could affect flood defence infrastructure; as a guide, this requirement applies to proposals within an area of 20 metres from the top of the bank of a main river. There are also parts of the borough, where the formal flood defence is further than 20 metres away from the top of the bank of the river, particularly in relation to the River Thames, and this needs to be taken account of in any development proposal that could affect the defences. 16.83 Proposals for redevelopment should seek opportunities to set back the development from existing flood defences. The Council, in conjunction with the Environment Agency, will require a buffer zone of at least 8 metres on the borough's rivers (including the fluvial Thames and culverted main rivers) and 16 metres for the tidal Thames. For some sites, where they are specifically defended by embankments, development may need to provide more than 16 metres set back to allow for future raisings. In addition, an Environment Agency Flood Risk Activity Permit (FRAP) is required for certain activities that take place within either 8 metres or 16 metres from the main river, flood defence and/or a culvert. Development must be set back to allow for the maintenance and future upgrading of the flood defences as well as for improvements to flood flow and flood storage capabilities.There may be situations where it is not feasible to set back development by the above amounts.

Applicants are strongly encouraged to liaise with the Environment Agency for any development that could affect flood defence infrastructure as their consent will be required for any works that could affect the flood defences. Basements and subterranean developments in flood affected areas 16.84 While Policy 54 Basements and subterranean developments applies to basement proposals in the whole borough, the focus of this policy is on basements within flood affected areas of the borough, where they represent a particularly high risk to life, and it is essential that careful consideration is given to their design and use. If proposing a basement in flood affected areas, this policy in addition to Policy 54 applies. 16.85 Basements may be subject to very rapid inundation of floodwater and it is essential that the minimum design requirements as set out in this policy as well as in the Council's SFRA are rigorously adhered to.The Council [has produced a Basement Assessment User](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/media/20818/user_guide_basement_assessment.pdf) [Guide (2021), which provides advice where](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/media/20818/user_guide_basement_assessment.pdf) proposals include a basement, cellar, or other subsurface structure. It is designed to guide users through the basement assessment process and ensure that the correct supporting information is submitted with a planning application. In addition, the Council has produced Guidance on Basement developments, which provides advice on both planning as well as non-planning matters for all basement construction in the borough. It covers permits and requirements and local amenity, construction and design issues. 16.86 This policy restricts basement developments in areas of Extreme, Significant and Moderate Breach Hazard, as set out in the Council's SFRA and ‘More Vulnerable’ (such as residential) uses will only be considered if a site-specific Flood Risk Assessment can demonstrate that the risk to life can be managed. As the SFRA is updated regularly, the applicant will need to confirm with the Council whether a development proposal is located within a breach hazard area. This includes throughflow and groundwater policy zones (see SFRA), wherein a Screening Assessment must be carried out as part of the planning application submission for all basement and cellar proposals. 16.87 No essential services or storage space for key provisions and equipment should be located at basement level where they need to remain operational during a flood event. By virtue of the low lying nature of basements, they are vulnerable to many types of flooding and in particular sewer flooding. Therefore, all new basements with a waste outlet (such as toilets, bathrooms, utility rooms) will need to be protected from sewer flooding through the installation of a suitable (positively) pumped device, which will need to be shown in drawings submitted with a planning application. 16.88 The Council's SFRA sets out further guidance on basements, including how to assess ground floor level and internal access level requirements for basements.The SFRA also sets out the locations of through-flow and ground-water policy zones. Subsurface structure development proposals within these zones need to fulfil site-specific requirements to demonstrate that basements, cellars, and other subsurface structures can be safely developed without increasing throughflow and groundwater related flood risk. 16.89 A Screening Assessment is required as part of the planning application submission for all basement and cellar proposals within the throughflow and groundwater policy zones. The Screening Assessment should address the impacts of the proposed subsurface development on the area’s subterranean characteristics, land stability, and flood risk and drainage. If the Screening Assessment determines that the proposed subsurface development may have an impact on the local environment, or if it determines that further investigation work is required, then a Basement Impact Assessment is required. 16.90 The Basement Impact Assessment, undertaken by an appropriate chartered professional or specialist, must include, but is not limited to, the following details: 1.

Development can have significant detrimental impacts on water resources. This may be by placing additional strain on existing water supplies, or by affecting flood patterns through increasing the amount of impermeable land in areas at risk of flooding.The existing sewer system may not have capacity for increases in wastewater and from increases in heavy rainfall events due to climate change. 16.93 The Council seeks to protect and improve water quality to ensure that the Blue Ribbon Network is healthy, attractive and offers a valuable series of habitats. Proposals that have the potential to lead to a reduction in water quality will be resisted. 16.94 The pollution of water resources through development may also cause significant harmful impacts on the health and wellbeing of sensitive receptors, both directly and indirectly, along with the degradation of the natural environment and local amenity. 16.95 Under the Water Framework Directive (WFD), there are four river water-bodies in this borough, all of which fail to achieve ‘good’ ecological status. The Beverley Brook, the Thames (upstream of Teddington) and the Crane water-bodies have been classified as having ‘poor’ ecological status and the Longford River has ‘moderate’ ecological status. Under the WFD, any deterioration of water bodies (groundwater and surface waters) needs to be prevented; ‘good status’ or ‘good ecological potential’ should be achieved by 2027. Therefore, developments adjacent to, or with the potential to affect, these rivers are encouraged to include measures such as managing the run-off or improving surface water outfalls, in order to improve their water quality. A flood risk activity permit may need to be submitted to the Environment Agency (see Policy 8 and Policy 40 of this Plan). 16.96 Some local surface water and groundwater bodies in the gravel aquifer are hydraulically connected. Potentially contaminative uses will be directed away from locations that are sensitive in terms of groundwater and surface water receptors, in order to protect the surface water courses and groundwater quality in the borough’s aquifers. So that contamination of local surface water and groundwater bodies does not occur, development proposals may require an environmental permit if construction sites are dealing with the discharge of liquid or wastewater (also see Policy 53 in relation to Construction Management Plans). Water and sewage provision 16.97 Many existing water mains, sewerage systems and treatment works are becoming overloaded.Water companies are responsible for ensuring that water supply, drainage and wastewater infrastructure is in place in advance of new development coming forward. A statutory duty is placed on the water industry to meet such infrastructure needs, and it is essential to ensure that such infrastructure is in place ahead of development to avoid unacceptable impacts on the environment such as sewage flooding of residential and commercial property, pollution of land and watercourses plus water shortages with associated low-pressure water supply problems. Consequently, development should only take place where the new demand upon existing infrastructure is taken into account. 212",

This is to cover the period 2019/20 -2028/29 although it was finally confirmed on publication of the London Plan in March 2021, and can be rolled forward for future years beyond 2029. The indicative target beyond 2029 is 3,639 homes for net housing completions, or 306 homes per annum, based on rolling forward in accordance with the London Plan identified capacity for large sites and the small sites figure, until it is replaced by a revised target in a new London Plan. 17.2 In accordance with London Plan Policy H1 this target is expected to be achieved, 17.4 through optimising the potential for housing delivery on all suitable and available brownfield sites. The Local Housing Needs Assessment 2021 analysis considers demographic trends and a scenario to understand the potential population growth associated with the delivery of 411 homes per annum. The Government has set out the importance of building the homes that communities need and putting in place measures to supply housing delivery.There is a standard method for assessing local housing need which provides a starting point in determining the number of homes needed in an area, and Government guidance is clear that the responsibility for the overall distribution of housing need in London lies with the Mayor. In December 2020 the Government published a revised methodology with a 35% uplift applied to London, however the Government is clear this will only be applicable once the next London Plan is being developed. A housing trajectory is published and annually updated, in the Council’s Authority Monitoring Report (AMR). This is required by the NPPF and identifies a supply of specific deliverable sites sufficient to provide five years supply of housing.This is assessed against the housing requirements together with an additional buffer of 5% (moved forward from later in the plan period) to ensure choice and competition in the market for land. 1 [New ward boundaries come into effect in Richmond at the Council elections in May 2022.](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/council/elections_voting_and_registration/electoral_boundaries/review_of_polling_districts_and_polling_places) 2 The Ham, Petersham and Richmond Riverside ward boundary extends further than the neighbourhood area including Richmond Hill. 214",

This is considered relevant to the borough, given the shortfall in delivery in 2021/22 and the initial future years, balanced against the considerable increase expected in small sites delivery whereby there will be a time lag for the change in the policy context towards incremental intensification to result in proposals coming forward, and given some identified large sites are expected to deliver in years five to ten. Government has also acknowledged the disruption to housing delivery and monitoring caused by restrictions in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The latest housing Authority Monitoring Report (reviewed annually) sets out that the borough is on course to meet and exceed the strategic dwelling requirement over a ten year period.This is reflected in the broad expected pattern of future housing land supply set out in Policy 10 part B, which sets out indicative ranges for the broad areas and are not to be regarded as any lower or upper limit, as the overall target is to be exceeded. The site allocations as set out within this Plan will contribute to this delivery. The rationale from Government and the Mayor of London for driving a step change increase in housing delivery is clear. Meeting the higher housing target in the London Plan 17.8 17.9 will be a challenge, given the constraints in the borough and meeting other plan priorities. The borough is characterised by large areas of protected open land and constraints such as flood risk, and the remaining area is built up, much of it being within designated Conservation Areas. As such there are few large potential housing sites available and there is pressure on land for other key uses including schools and employment to support the achievement of sustainable communities. The Urban Design Study has identified capacity for growth in the borough. The Council will encourage higher density development in more sustainable locations, such as main centres and areas better served by public transport, subject to compatibility with established character. Development should optimise site capacity through the design-led approach. This, along with local factors, such as proximity to facilities and to public transport routes, and the character of the surrounding area, will be taken into account in reaching the appropriate density for a particular site; see Policy 28 Local Character and Design Quality, Policy 44 Design Process, and Policy 45 Tall and Mid-Rise Building Zones. Some additional housing will also be provided through conversions and through change of use to housing from other uses where this would not conflict with other policies. A significant increase is expected in delivery from small sites, as set out in Policy 16 Small Sites.

However, due to a change in the GLA methodology for monitoring, a revised housing flow return was submitted by the GLA which confirmed 877 homes delivery in this period, a measurement of 108%, and therefore no action required. 17.10 Proposals should optimise the potential of sites. The majority of housing delivery in the borough is expected to be on previously [developed land. An updated Brownfield Land](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/planning/planning_policy/brownfield_land_register) [Register of sites appropriate for residential](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/planning/planning_policy/brownfield_land_register) development is published each year. Even some cleared sites within the borough generally have a former use, while the majority of open land within the borough that would be regarded as greenfield is covered by protective designations based on an up to date evidence base, and thus other policies in this Plan would prevent building on greenfield sites. 17.11 The Government’s Housing Delivery Test (HDT) is an annual measurement of housing delivery: Results of the 2018 HDT showed 1,332 homes delivery 2015/16 to 2017/18 against 945 homes required, a measurement of 141% and therefore no action required. Results of the 2019 HDT showed 1,147 homes delivery 2016/17 to 2019/20 against 945 homes requirement, a measurement of 121% and therefore no action required. 17.12 For the 2020 measurement, a reduction in the period for measuring total homes required was applied, using an 11-month period for the 2019/20 monitoring year, to account for disruption to housing delivery and monitoring linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the 2021 measurement, Government applied a four-month reduction to account for continued fluctuations due to COVID-19 disruptions. In accordance with the Government thresholds, if future delivery falls below 95% of the housing requirement, then an action plan will be produced to assess the causes of under-delivery and identify actions to increase delivery in future years. The stepped requirement set out above will be used in future Housing Delivery Tests. See also Policy 55 Delivery and Monitoring. 216",

The following requirements apply: 1. On all former employment sites at least 50% on-site provision.

This results in people from not just London but all over the world wanting to make Richmond their home. However, due to the scarcity of land in the borough and other factors it is now experiencing an acute affordable housing crisis. Not enough affordable housing is being built to help alleviate the ever-growing need. Therefore, the Council will do everything in its power to make sure over the plan period we hit the 50% target. 17.14 Affordable housing does not just benefit the people who reside in these properties. To have a truly mixed and balanced community we need to provide homes that our teachers, firefighters, police officers, nurses, carers, trades people, mechanics, and retail workers can afford. This is not an exhaustive list but without these workers the borough would be simply worse off. Providing genuinely affordable homes for local key workers will also help towards Policy 1 Living Locally and the 20-minute neighbourhood, meaning key workers are able to live and work locally reducing in-commuting and making a more resilient community in the longer term. In addition having genuinely affordable properties to rent or buy means that residents can have more income to spend in the local economy which benefits local businesses. 17.15 The borough of Richmond has some of the highest house prices in the United Kingdom. To put the values into perspective below is a table of average house prices across all housing types in Richmond compared with London, outer London and the UK (Land Registry HPI June 2021).

This study looks at the current need in the borough, need from newly-forming households and existing households falling into need, minus the supply of affordable housing which is equal to the net need per annum of affordable housing. The LHNA estimates a net annual need of 1,123 affordable rented and 552 affordable home ownership products to be provided between 2021-2039. These unconstrained figures do not take account of capacity and land availability and are therefore significantly higher than Richmond’s overall annual housing target of 411 homes per annum during the current London Plan period (2019-2041), which takes account of the borough's constraints. 17.17 Richmond has a finite amount of large-scale developable sites due to various constraints, including the Thames and the various parks and open spaces. Small sites make a significant contribution to housing supply.The London Plan Policy H2 has set a minimum target of delivering 234 homes per year from small sites in the borough of Richmond, 57% of the overall annual housing target. The cumulative impact of these sites should contribute to affordable housing provision, justified by the evidence base and local circumstances. Without these contributions it would be a significant challenge to deliver the amount of affordable housing this borough needs. 17.18 Contributions from small sites will be secured via a Planning Obligation. Financial contributions made to the ringfenced Affordable Housing Fund are allocated to the Council's Housing Capital Programme and used to help fund new affordable housing, or to fund acquisition of land and private properties for this purpose, or for enhanced provision through re-modelling existing affordable units or supported schemes, in pursuance of housing and planning objectives. The financial contribution will not be converted into the actual delivery of units on an identified linked site, unless suitable, as it is vital that affordable housing is delivered in the most effective way. 17.19 The affordable housing policy applies to all new housing development, including changes of use for wholly residential and mixed-use sites incorporating residential use, where planning permission is required. The affordable housing provision (on-site or off-site) or any financial contribution should be calculated in relation to gross rather than net development. In London the majority of development is brownfield and does not need to be incentivised, as in many cases the building will only have been made vacant for the sole purpose of re-development, therefore the Vacant Building Credit will not apply. A flowchart outlining the policy requirements and the mechanism for assessing the contributions from individual sites is set out in the Affordable Housing SPD; including how each proposal is assessed to make an adequate contribution towards affordable housing which is directly, fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the development proposed. It is considered necessary to make it acceptable in planning terms, and the absence of an obligation will be considered as undermining the Council’s housing strategy and harm the provision of affordable housing in the area. 17.20 In the context of the Local Plan, genuinely affordable housing is primarily considered to be homes rented at either social rent or London Affordable Rent levels. The Council priority is social rented homes, as this is most affordable product available. Any schemes built through the GLA’s current Affordable Homes Programme are expected to be for social rent. London Affordable Rent will be acceptable if evidence is provided that it will be affordable to the majority of residents living in the borough. Intermediate housing (such as Shared Ownership, London Living Rent) on site will only be considered genuinely affordable when delivered in compliance with the Council’s Intermediate Housing Policy 219",

          "content": "Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) - June 2023 Statement 2019 (and any further updates to this).The Council’s latest affordability criteria and priority allocation for Intermediate Housing includes key workers. At application stage the affordability of the affordable housing products provided will be assessed on the total cost of the home, including service charges. First Homes and Starter Homes are not considered to be affordable in the context of Richmond due to the borough’s high house prices.There are areas of the borough where even a 50% discount on open market value would not reduce the price under the £420,000 cap set by National Government for First Homes. These extremely large reductions have the ability to impact the viability of schemes which in turn could jeopardise the provision of affordable rented homes, which is the priority need in the borough. 17.21 The threshold (10 units or above) is expressed in terms of the capability of the site, in order to overcome attempts to evade thresholds. For example, these could be by lowering densities, providing unit sizes significantly above the Nationally Described Space Standards, failing to provide the required mix of units, phasing development, submitting subsequent applications on the same site or adjoining sites, or by incremental acquisition of sites. In these circumstances the Council would apply the affordable housing policy requirements. 17.22 London Plan Policy H5 has set out a threshold approach where if a site meets 35% affordable housing or 50% in the case of public sector or industrial land, then they will not need to submit a viability assessment at the application stage. This policy is aimed at fast tracking applications through the system that provide the threshold level without being held up by potentially protracted discussions regarding viability. Richmond’s affordable housing need is so great and the borough has such a limited supply of major sites, using the threshold approach would have a detrimental impact on the Council achieving its goal of providing 50% affordable housing across the borough. 17.23 The percentage of affordable housing on a scheme should be measured in habitable rooms to ensure that a range of sizes of affordable homes can be delivered, including family-sized homes. Figures should be presented as a percentage of total residential provision in habitable rooms, units and floorspace to enable comparison. The Council’s Affordable Housing Enabling Officers will provide guidance and should be involved in the discussions with Registered Providers at an early stage, to determine the appropriate housing mix, including bedsize, to reflect local needs as set out in Policy 13 Housing Mix and Standards, taking into account the site-specifics of the location. 17.24 In the Local Plan 2018, the tenure split is 80/20 in favour of affordable rent over intermediate products. The need for affordable rent has not changed in the borough but there has been a change in policy within the London Plan. London Plan Policy H6 prescribes the affordable housing tenure split that London Boroughs should be applying in their policies.This is 30% low cost rent (social or London Affordable Rent), 30% intermediate (i.e London Living rent or Shared Ownership) and 40% to be determined by the borough. As the overriding need as evidenced by the LHNA in Richmond is for low cost rented homes the whole of the 40% will be towards that product. This is the reasoning for the policy’s 70/30 split in favour of affordable rented products. The Council will still support (potentially through grant) any development, especially on public sector land, that provides a tenure split of 80/20. 17.25 The Council has rigorously tested their affordable housing targets to make sure that they are viable through what is called a Whole Plan Viability Study. It is confirmed that the policy compliant level of affordable housing required on sites is viable so the Council will not accept anything less. Applications submitted that provide less affordable housing than set out in policy will be rejected. The Council will in extraordinary circumstances and on a case-by case basis, accept viability arguments if it can be demonstrated that the site has abnormal costs that could not be foreseen. For example, infrastructure provision that could not have been foreseen at The Whole Plan Viability stage and need to be considered on a site-specific basis taking into account variations between private 220",

The Council will only accept viability arguments once it has been confirmed that the applicant has explored with the relevant Council officers the availability and application of grant to increase or provide a better tenure of affordable housing. 17.26 Where viability evidence is required this will need to follow the guidance set out in RICS Assessing Viability in Planning under the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 for England (2021), National Planning Policy Guidance, the Council’s Affordable Housing SPD and the GLA’s Affordable Housing and Viability SPG. The Council will expect all developers to ensure that they identify and get the Council’s approval of a Registered Provider to support the delivery of affordable housing on site at the time of submission of a planning application. To confirm on-site deliverability and/or establish notional values of affordable units which reflect local housing market conditions, evidence should be provided of discussions with a number of Registered Providers (Not for Profit and demonstrating a high standard of management). The onus will be on developers to pay for any viability assessment if the proposal is not policy compliant and any cost of independent assessment. If build costs need to be assessed, then developers will also need to pay for these to be reviewed by an independent Quantity Surveyor. 17.27 As evidenced by the LHNA the Council has a substantial need for affordable housing. As small sites which are not in employment use (less than 10 units and/or 1000sqm) aren’t required to provide on-site affordable housing, this requires schemes above the threshold to deliver 50% to help achieve our target. Therefore, payments in lieu will be strongly resisted where the policy requirement is for on-site provision.The Council only has a finite number of deliverable sites due to the various constraints in the borough. Offsite delivery or a payment in lieu would mean an opportunity to deliver actual affordable housing would be missed. If in the extraordinary circumstance that off-site provision is acceptable, then the Council will expect that the affordable housing is maximised on both sites. The Council will only accept this arrangement if the total number of affordable habitable rooms over both sites equal 50% of the total number of habitable rooms. 17.28 Affordable housing will be secured on site by way of a legal agreement. To incentivise developers to build out their permissions in a timely manner, an early stage review will be inserted into all legal agreements securing affordable housing with a trigger date of 18 months after the date of the decision. The Council will be resisting any development which provides less than 50% affordable housing on site. If in the extraordinary circumstance that an application is approved providing less than 50% affordable housing, an advanced stage review mechanism will be used to make sure that the scheme provides a policy compliant level (50%) of affordable housing if viability improves over the life cycle of the development. Review mechanisms in line with national policy guidance cannot be used to try and reduce the amount of affordable housing being provided. 17.29 The Council expects all new developments in the borough to be tenure blind. The schemes should be designed and managed so that all residents have equal access to the common areas, open space and not restricted on the use of the site based on the value of their home. The Council will strongly resist the use of gates which separate areas within a development. If this is required due to safety reasons, then evidence will need to be provided which shows all residents will have access to the gated area. Affordable Housing schemes should be designed with the same ethos and attention to detail as a market housing scheme. Policy 44 sets out the design process the Council expects developers to follow where it is open market housing or affordable housing. 221",

Existing accommodation needs to be protected given the constraints of land supply and new accommodation encouraged recognising affordability issues in the borough. The limited land supply means that new developments must be directed at identified priority local needs. 17.31 The range of housing to meet specific community needs can include sheltered housing with care support, staffed hostels, residential care homes/nursing homes, almshouses, extra-care housing, provision by local colleges, hotels and other institutions for their students and/or staff. These include supported housing provision for children, older persons and other client groups. This list is not exhaustive. These can be provided in all types of new housing development, change of use for wholly residential schemes, and mixed use sites incorporating residential use, where planning permission is required. 17.32 Local need should be identified on the basis of up to date evidence and related to the Council’s housing and associated strategies, including specific reviews concerning supported housing for specific client groups, or other relevant strategies. Strategies produced by third parties demonstrating local need should have been subject to consultation with appropriate bodies or verification to demonstrate the robustness of the evidence to the Council. The type of accommodation proposed for any site must be kept under regular review and not assumed to have stayed the same, as communities needs can change within a short time period. Evidence will be considered in relation to the Council's research and strategic priorities. If there is no evidential need arising within the borough, other priorities should be addressed and the capacity for conventional housing should not be compromised. Limited land means that development to accommodate needs arising from outside the borough will not generally be supported. 17.33 The Local Housing Needs Assessment is a boroughwide assessment providing updated evidence on housing need and detailing the need for different forms of specialist housing. Housing Learning and Improvement Network (LIN) have undertaken an assessment of need for specialised housing and accommodation for older people in Richmond. 17.34 The Richmond Housing and Homelessness Strategy 2021-26 sets out the Council’s commitment to supporting the needs of vulnerable residents and how through partnership working there will be appropriate support so that people can access suitable housing. This includes ensuring that appropriate housing and support is available to enable older people and people with disabilities to maintain their independence. It recognises the need for accommodation pathways that meet the needs of people with learning disabilities and mental ill health, and ensuring that care leavers have access to appropriate housing that meets their need. 223",

The Council’s Market Position Statement 2018/19 contained information on the adult social care and support market, setting out details on supply and demand, planned changes and emerging trends for services. This has been updated and supplementary information on the projected need for accommodation-based care is set out in the Richmond Accommodation-based Care Commissioning Statement 2022. 17.36 It is recognised that Richmond has an ageing population with increasing levels of disability and frailty. As set out in the LHNA, population growth is projected to be concentrated in older age groups (those aged 65 and over), with this age group being projected to increase by 50% from 2021 to 2039. There is a significant increase to 2039 in the projected over-75 population and the increasing number of older people with dementia related needs. Although some households will seek to downsize, barriers can include financial inequalities, suitability of housing, and social factors, which form a complex picture and a cautious view should be taken about the willingness of households to move to smaller homes. The Housing LIN analysis sets out current anticipated likely need (prevalence rate) and the associated estimated need (units/bedspaces) for each type of specialised housing and accommodation for older people, but assumed that up to 50% of this estimated need could be met through the provision of mainstream housing. It may be possible through minor layout changes or improvements, or enabling works such as ground floor extensions, to enable people to stay in their own homes, or to take-up housing in new development built to higher inclusive access standards.This reduces the indicative London Plan benchmark to circa 75 units per year for specialist older persons housing. 17.37 Government guidance emphasises self-build or custom build to diversify the housing market and increase consumer choice. Since 2016 the Council has been required to keep and have regard to a register of people who are interested in a self-build or custom-build home in the borough. The Council has been granted an exemption by Government from the duty to permit enough serviced plots of land to meet the demand for self-build and custom housebuilding. The reason for this is the demand for self-build and custom housebuilding is greater than 20% of the land identified by the Council as being available for future housing.This calculation is run each year to see if the threshold is still exceeded and if so, the exemption remains. 17.38 Student housing will only be supported where it meets demonstrable local need and does not compromise capacity for conventional homes or undermine policies to secure mixed and balanced communities. It must not prejudice the supply of affordable housing and other priority supported housing. It should be brought forward in conjunction with an existing local institution and demonstrate that the proposed design will meet their needs, including details on affordability. The LHNA does not identify any current need for additional student accommodation.The future strategy for St Mary's University proposes growth in student accommodation will be delivered through a combination of improvements and development on-site alongside the ongoing relationships with external partners. 17.39 The Private Rented Sector (PRS) can assist in meeting a range of needs and be particularly suitable for certain locations.The LHNA modelled the distribution of PRS dwellings in the borough at 24%. Purpose built schemes are referred to as ‘Build to Rent’ and it is recognised these are operated on a different model to build for sale. It can for example offer longer term tenancies/more certainty over long term availability and ensure effective management through single ownership.

Wholly PRS proposals are unlikely to be supported where they do not contribute to the borough’s highest priority need for affordable housing. 17.40 Large-scale purpose-built shared living schemes, often called co-living, are a relatively new form of housing, which can provide a housing option for households who cannot or choose not to live in self-contained homes or HMOs; often targeted at transient younger, high skilled professional households and individuals. The LHNA did not identify a particular need for co-living in the borough, given the borough has a higher proportion of families and older persons. However, there is an opportunity for creating mixed communities in which some people with additional needs (e.g. learning disabilities or physical disabilities) live alongside others from the younger, high-skilled group who provide some support as a condition of their tenancy. This may be a way to secure supported housing on a larger site, to meet a range of needs within a development. 17.41 All proposals for the provision (or loss) of housing to meet specific community needs will be assessed having regard to the Council’s Housing and Homelessness Strategy, Commissioning evidence and strategies including those for associated client group(s). This will be considered along with the advice of the Council in its housing and commissioning roles, including adult health and social care; the advice of Achieving for Children, where relevant; and the South West London Integrated Care System or any other relevant NHS or health body. Proposals for the development of any specialist housing should demonstrate that there is a local need for such accommodation. Given the scarcity of land, there may be additional benefits that can be recognised where it can be demonstrated proposals will provide pathways through different types of needs that may provide wider opportunities, such as to step down a level of care and support or for transitional move-on accommodation, or enabling in-borough provision. 17.42 Provision is encouraged in accessible locations and integrated within communities, particularly to ensure that provision supports access to existing personal and community networks and can reduce the need for formal care and support. High quality design standards will be required, relevant to client needs and their expected behaviours, including inclusive design and provision of internal and external space. For example, older people’s accommodation should address specific needs such as storage of electric buggies in dry locations, increasing wheelchair housing and turning circles for day centre buses. For example, any proposed shared living must provide adequate space to address inclusive access - designing co-living to ADM Volume 2/BS 8300 and taking note of some aspects of ADM Volume 1 M4(3) for the wheelchair adaptable/accessible rooms. The Council’s Specialist Housing Occupational Therapist may be able to offer guidance at an early stage to ensure inclusive access is maximised in any housing to meet the needs of different groups. To assist the delivery of supported housing, the Council's informal Specification: Supported Housing Accommodation; as referred to in the supporting text to Policy 13, sets out expectations and requirements for all types of supported housing development for different people groups.The Mayor of London has published a Practice Note on Wheelchair Accessible and Adaptable Student Accommodation (2022). 17.43 Innovative modern methods of construction, such as modular housing partly constructed off-site, are also encouraged where it can assist housing delivery in terms of construction and sustainability. To innovatively address future supported housing needs, the use of flexible layouts and adaptable space that can make use of digital technology and could be altered to meet different needs over time is encouraged. For example there could be flexibility whether providing support for mental health or people with learning disabilities, providing the design allows for the complexity of needs and the care and support that will be needed, and the potential impacts and infrastructure needs can be assessed.There are opportunities for inter-generational and integrated developments, as suggested in paragraph 17.40 above.

A cascade will be sought to ensure the units will be first offered to eligible persons residing within the borough, for example for a minimum period of 3 or 6 months. 17.44 The Council’s identified priorities for new specialist housing development, at the time of writing, include: Extra care and supported living provision including developing more specialist provision for service users with complex, high-level needs and challenging behaviour, and accommodation options for move-on pathway; Innovative and sustainable dementia friendly accommodation; Specialist ‘core and cluster’ schemes of self-contained flats with 24 hours staffing and communal areas for adults with a learning disability; Ensuite scheme with high support for adults with mental health needs, including to assist with moving towards independent living; Specialist supported housing for adults with physical and sensory needs; Supported housing of trainee flats for care leavers to act as a pathway into permanent tenancies; Remodelling of older peoples sheltered accommodation for modernisation or replacement to provide self contained units. 17.45 However, as identified in the LHNA, the need for affordable homes remains substantial and is therefore a higher priority to those identified above. Where proposed residential provision does not itself meet the NPPF definition of affordable housing, affordable housing policy requirements as set out in Policy 11 Affordable Housing will be applicable to all site proposals for accommodation considered under this policy and it is expected that schemes will be designed to accommodate the priority needs for affordable housing alongside other types of housing for specific groups. As set out In Policy 11 Affordable Housing the threshold approach to fast track applications providing lower levels of affordable provision in proposals to meet the needs of different groups, such as affordable student accommodation or specialist older persons housing, is not considered appropriate in the borough context given the significant land constraints and high level of general affordable housing need. 17.46 The Council's research on Gypsies and Travellers in 2013 and 2015 (report published in 2016) suggested that there is no demonstrated need for additional pitches; although there is a need to protect the existing site. There may be opportunities for other innovative solutions to improve support to address needs such as providing floating support to those in bricks and mortar to address issues of isolation, managing a home and maintaining a tenancy. The Council’s research has been updated with new surveys in 2022, and the overall position remains similar, even taking into account some recent unauthorised encampments. The London Plan also sets out in the supporting text to Policy H14 that the Mayor will initiate and lead a London-wide gypsy and traveller accommodation needs assessment, with a report due to be published in 2023, and will work to support boroughs in finding ways to make provision for gypsy and traveller accommodation. 226",

It is an important issue in the borough given the scarcity of housing land supply and particularly to prevent sub-standard accommodation in small units. It is important to make efficient use of land and cater for changing lifestyles, including home working, and accord with requirements for inclusive access.The pandemic has further highlighted the importance of having access to outdoor and indoor space, particularly with the potential for future working patterns in some sectors to retain a high proportion of home working. 17.50 The Council has therefore adopted the Nationally Described Space Standard and the optional higher Building Regulations Part M for inclusive access. The Government has since April 2021 required all new homes created through permitted development rights to comply with the Nationally Described Space Standard. 17.51 The space standards are minimum requirements which applicants are encouraged to exceed. Although as set out in London Plan paragraph 3.6.2 and of particular relevance in the borough due to limited land supply, dwellings with floor areas significantly above the Nationally Described Space Standard will be resisted - due to the level of housing need and the need to make efficient use of land. If oversized units are proposed, their impact should be assessed assuming greater occupancy as to the potential infrastructure impacts. 17.52 The Nationally Described Space Standard sets a minimum ceiling height of 2.3 metres for at least 75% of the gross internal area of the dwelling. Following the approach set in the London Plan Policy D6 and paragraph 3.6.3 to address the impacts of the unique urban heat island effect and the fact that the majority of housing developments in London are made up of flats, a minimum ceiling height of 2.5m for at least 75% of the gross internal area is required to ensure that new housing is of adequate quality, especially in terms of daylight penetration, ventilation and cooling, and sense of space. The risk of overheating is a particular concern. The provision of dual aspect dwellings should be maximised, in accordance with London Plan Policy D6 and paragraphs 3.6.4 and 3.6.5. 17.53 Private outside space is desirable in all circumstances. For external amenity space, London Plan Policy D6 states a minimum of 5 sqm of private outdoor space should be provided for 1-2 person dwellings and an extra 1 sqm should be provided for each additional occupant, and it must achieve a minimum depth and width of 1.5 metres. Proposals should demonstrate their capability, to accommodate furniture, access and activities, based on the number of future occupants. 17.54 Unlike the other standards in this policy, part E should apply to all dwellings created via works to which Approved Document M (ADM) Volume 1 applies which at the time of writing generally limits the application to new build dwellings. The London Plan supporting text to Policy D7 sets out guidance including for shared approach routes, application to all tenures, step-free access into dwellings and where there may be flexibility around provision of a lift to all dwelling entrances. There may be the opportunity even where step-free access is not possible, for dwellings at entrance level to meet other requirements for M4(2) and M4(3) to maximise inclusive access. It is acknowledged that homes to M4(3) may need larger floorspace elements than the minimum standard, to deliver compliant wheelchair adaptable / accessible homes. 17.55 Guidance should be sought from the Council’s Specialist Housing Occupational Therapist at an early stage in designing wheelchair accessible dwellings and guidance can be provided on meeting requirements (an informal Accessible and Inclusive Housing overview note and guidance applicable to a site proposal is available, which has been approved by the Council). The Council will negotiate through site-specific discussions the most effective way to maximise provision 228",

All new build housing to M4(3) that is affordable housing to which the Council has nomination rights must be built out as fully wheelchair ‘accessible’ i.e. a home readily useable by a wheelchair user at the point of completion. All new build housing to M4(3) that is for shared ownership or market housing must be easily ‘adaptable’ to wheelchair housing. The Council’s informal Specification: Supported Housing Accommodation sets out expectations and requirements for all types of supported housing development for different people groups, as relevant to proposals considered against Policy 12. 17.56 The Government announced in 2022 they will mandate the M4 (2) requirement in Building Regulations as a minimum standard for all new homes and M4 (1) will apply by exception only where M4 (2) is impractical and unachievable, as part of their commitment to raising accessibility standards for new homes.

The London Plan housing target for the Council will be challenging to achieve and any loss of existing units exacerbates this. To preserve the supply of housing need, any net loss of housing units will be resisted. The London Plan places an emphasis on optimising use of land, including at Policy H8 that any loss of existing housing should be replaced by new housing at existing or higher densities. 17.62 This policy is aimed at individual smaller sites, rather than large scale remodelling. 17.63 Houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) can provide a valued source of cheaper accommodation, particularly for young and transient groups in the population, who have not reached a stage where they can or want to buy, for people who are unable to gain access to other forms of housing and for people who would otherwise be homeless. HMOs can reduce pressure on other elements of the housing stock. Their quality can, however, give rise to concern. The Council maintain a register of licensed HMOs which need to comply with management regulations and local minimum amenity standards, although it is emphasised the Council’s local Minimum Amenity Standards are not the ideal state and amenities should not be deliberately reduced to reach only the minimum standard. Where they are of a reasonable standard they should generally be protected, to accord with London Plan Policy H9. This applies to larger HMOs (for more than six people) which are defined as being a ‘sui generis’ use. 17.64 It is unlawful for homes in Greater London to be used as short-term holiday rented accommodation for a cumulative period of more than 90 days a year without seeking planning permission.The use of dwellings as short-term holiday rentals can have a detrimental impact on neighbours’ residential amenity and community cohesion, especially when concentrated in a particular location. This use also reduces the supply of homes available for people to live in, and given the pressures on housing supply in the borough, the permanent loss of housing stock is therefore resisted. 17.65 There is a presumption for the applicant to first assess the potential for retaining and refurbishing existing buildings. This reflects the climate change emergency and the need to consider the whole life cycle of development, including the existing buildings embodied carbon, given the support for upgrading and reusing existing buildings as set out in Policy 4 Minimising Greenhouse gas emissions and promoting energy efficiency and Policy 28 Local Character and Design Quality. There should be full consideration as to whether existing housing can be improved or converted to a satisfactory standard. Proposals for redevelopment will be assessed for benefits on the balance of the quality of housing provision, particularly in respect of design and amenity considerations and the impact on character and the streetscene, informed by the Urban Design Study and the Council's Village Planning Guidance SPDs. 230",

Given the housing needs and emphasis on optimising capacity on sites, proposals should generally not involve the net loss of more than one unit, due to the impact on housing supply. 17.67 It is recognised that Registered Providers are subject to complex financial regulations and have to address specific needs. Therefore, exceptions to policy will be considered in cases where conversions, reversions or redevelopment will result in affordable units being retained and managed as affordable housing by a Registered Provider or similar body, in furtherance of the Council’s Housing and related Strategies. Any proposals replacing existing affordable housing and for estate redevelopment will need to accord with Policy 11 Affordable Housing and London Plan Policy H8. 17.68 Reversions of houses converted into flats back into a single-family dwelling house will only be considered acceptable if the property was originally built as a single-family dwelling house, and it can be demonstrated the loss of a unit will be outweighed by environmental, streetscene, transport or parking benefits which could not be easily achieved without the reversion. Evidence of tangible benefits is required from an applicant to justify an exception on this basis. This can include assessments of sustainability or the poor standards of existing units. Reversions should not involve the combining of more than two units due to the borough’s housing needs. A stronger justification for an exception needs to be made if there is a greater loss of existing units, given reversions will be generally resisted due to the loss of existing stock. 17.69 The conversion of larger types of houses to flats can make a contribution to meeting certain housing needs and provides the opportunity to meet the need for small units. However, it must be recognised that only certain types of property are suitable for conversion, and that there are some areas where conversions would be incompatible with the existing character of the area, or lead to unacceptable parking conditions. In considering in principle the suitability of a property for conversion the Council will take into account: 1. the size of the property and its physical characteristics, including layout and size of rooms; 2. on-street parking conditions and on-street parking restrictions; the adequacy of public transport and access to local services and facilities to accord with Policy 1 Living Locally; 3. the amount of off-street parking which would be appropriate and its location, which must not unduly affect the amenities of adjoining premises or the character of the area; 4. the location of the property and the need to have regard to the character of existing residential areas, including that of specific roads, as identified in the Urban Design Study and the Council's Village Planning Guidance SPDs, to accord with Policy 28 Local Character and design quality; 5. the effect on the amenities of adjoining premises; 6. the extent to which the property contributes to meeting specific community needs in accordance with Policy 12 Housing Needs of Different Groups. 17.70 In cases where the Council accepts that in principle a property may be suitable for conversion, the design of the conversion will be required to provide a satisfactory standard of accommodation and contribute positively to its surroundings. If a property is considered suitable for conversion, the Council will take account of the following design considerations in assessing the proposal: 1. number of units in relation to size of property and layout in accordance with Policy 13 Housing Mix and Standards; 2. level of daylighting and sunlight and avoidance of overlooking in accordance with Policy 46 Amenity and Living Conditions; 231",

This policy could apply to a separate unit or units or an extension to an existing unit or outbuildings, including upward extensions, and could include side garden plots. Each site will be assessed as to whether it is considered suitable for development. 17.72 The London Plan expects a fundamental transformation in how new homes are delivered. Infill sites may be small-scale. Further details are set out under Policy 16 Small Sites, in support of London Plan Policy H2 on Small Sites which expects boroughs to pro-actively support new homes on small sites, and the specific nature of proposals on small sites. The London Plan expects incremental intensification to play an important role in contribution towards the housing targets for small sites, and the Areas for Intensification are mapped under that policy. 17.73 It is important that infill development reinforces the character of streets by reflecting the scale, mass, height, form, fenestration and architectural details of its neighbours. 17.74 The character of streets has often been weakened by infilling space between dwellings. In considering new infill development, the width of the remaining and the new plot should be similar to that prevailing in the immediate area and the established spacing between dwellings, building line and height should be maintained. 17.75 Character is also determined by materials and architectural details and these should reflect existing materials and predominant styles, in accordance with Policy 28 Local Character and Design Quality; the Design Quality SPD; Conservation Area Appraisals; the Urban Design Study; and the Council's Village Planning Guidance SPDs. As noted in the supporting text to Policy 11, modern methods of construction can assist in housing delivery, particularly off-site modular construction for smaller or awkward sites, provided it achieves the same high-quality design and standards. 17.76 The London Plan Guidance being prepared by the Mayor includes a number of documents that provide guidance on ensuring land is used in the best way to deliver the right quantity of new housing, at the right quality, in the right place, embedding high-quality design at the centre of housing delivery, including ’Optimising site capacity: A design-led approach’ (consultation draft February 2022) and 'Small Site Design Codes’ (consultation draft February 2022). 17.77 Land in built-up areas such as private residential gardens, parks and allotments are excluded from the definition of previously developed land in the NPPF and the London Plan. Most backland development in the borough involves loss of garden land. The NPPF recognises Plans should consider the case for setting policies to resist inappropriate development of residential gardens; and that the desirability of maintaining an area’s prevailing character and setting (including residential gardens) forms part of the consideration of making efficient use of land. There are direct and indirect values of gardens associated with contributing to local character, providing safe and secure amenity and play space, supporting biodiversity, helping to reduce flood risk and mitigating the effects of climate change including the heat island effect. 17.78 In the borough, residential gardens are particularly valued as part of an area’s prevailing character and setting, and for the ecological, climate change and general amenity value, and are therefore protected.

They are also recognised in the Design Quality SPD, in various Conservation Area Appraisals, and the Council's Village Planning Guidance SPDs. Policy 42 Trees, Woodlands and Landscape’ recognises the value of trees in the borough, including for example for wildlife habitats and providing shading. They also contribute to reducing surface water run-off. Some of these qualities may be measurable, some may not be perceived by the visual appearance and upkeep of a site. There could be an opportunity through mitigation to avoid a net loss of garden land and consider whether the proposal brings a net gain in housing units. Overall consideration will need to be made on a case-by-case basis.These factors mean that developments that involve a significant loss of garden land will normally be unacceptable.

There are often concerns raised by existing local communities regarding the impact of new development, such as the detrimental impact on character and amenity and the cumulative impacts on local infrastructure, such as transport, health, education and other community facilities. 17.80 However, the London Plan sets a strategic priority to increase the rate of housing delivery from small sites, particularly in Outer London. It sets small sites targets for each borough, as a component of the overall housing target, based on trends in housing completions on sites of this size and the estimated capacity for net additional housing supply from intensification in existing residential areas, taking into account PTAL, proximity to stations and town centres, and heritage constraints. For Richmond, it expects 2,340 net housing completions on small sites (below 0.25 hectares in size) over the 10 year period from 2019/20 to 2028/29. 17.81 The supply of large sites fluctuates and in some years completions from large sites have fallen as low as 7%, while in other years have risen to 70%. Average net completions on small sites 2013/14 to 2021/22 have already been averaging 156 homes per annum. The relative contribution from large and small sites in each borough may fluctuate across the target period, as recognised in the London Plan.The London Plan supports boroughs in using windfall assumptions in their five-year housing trajectories based on the small sites targets because, in contrast with recent annual trends on small sites, the figures are considered to better reflect a minimum 235",

This currently covers approximately 54% of the borough (see Map 17.1 below). Within these areas incremental intensification is actively encouraged; beyond these areas proposals may still be found acceptable provided no unacceptable impact(s) are identified when assessed against policies in this Plan. This type of intensification can take a number of forms, such as: new build, infill development, residential conversions, redevelopment or extension of existing buildings, including non-residential buildings and residential garages, where this results in net additional housing provision.

All are defined with a local centre boundary. 18.5 Local and neighbourhood centres as well as Important Local Parades provide a focus for local communities and opportunities to meet, shop, work, spend leisure time and access services.These have become more important for their contribution to enabling Living Locally, and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have often thrived as residents rediscovered their local areas. This trend is partly due to their higher proportion of independent, locally based businesses, benefitting from increased numbers of people working from home and from everyone being restricted in their movements during lockdowns. The successful function of the smaller centres of the borough is of special importance as the benefits for residents and local communities are significant; they are both quantifiable but can also be more intangible. A successful local centre provides goods and services which are convenient and result in a reduced need to travel. They are easier to access through active travel with a short journey by walking or cycling.This trend also supports local business and retains spending in the local area, which in turn benefits the wider community. Local centres in particular can create or foster a sense of community and inclusiveness that adds to the cohesiveness of the surrounding community so important for wellbeing. 18.6 The size and function of these centres vary considerably, ranging from larger local centres, such as Barnes and Hampton Hill with a good range of food and comparison shops, independent and specialist shops, community and cultural facilities, through to parades with a small number of shops meeting very local but valued needs. 18.7 The size of a proposed development should reflect the size and function of the relevant centre (as set out in the table above). For example, a large retail store should not be added to a small parade so that it effectively operates as a stand-alone store. Larger centres (often local centres in the hierarchy) will have a diverse role, in some cases significant leisure offers and have, or are developing, niche roles. Such centres should be able to develop their cultural and tourism potential or specialist shopping offer. The Council will seek to support businesses that are successful and expanding. Adapting our high streets to future retail needs 18.8 Historically, evidence has identified a need for modest additional retail floorspace, driven primarily by the borough’s rising population. Structural changes to the retail sector were already underway and will have been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including shifts in customer behaviour and growth in online shopping. However, a significant contraction in terms of commercial floorspace needs is not expected. The Richmond upon Thames Retail & Leisure Study (Phase 2) 2023 forecasts that up to 2034, there an over-supply of 2,900 sqm gross of retail floorspace, and an undersupply of food/beverage floorspace of approximately 5,400 sqm. Therefore, by 2034 there is a combined under-supply of approximately 2,500 sqm gross. Put simply, the need for shopping space is forecast to decrease but the need to provide space for the food & beverage sector and potentially the wider leisure sector is increasing. 18.9 Together with a borough-wide centre vacancy rate of 7.8% in all frontages (Town Centre Land Use Retail Survey 2022), the priority in the short to medium term will be the reoccupation of vacant shop units, potentially for non-retail uses including food/beverage outlets, leisure, entertainment and cultural uses. Based on a reasonable reduction in shop vacancy rates, reoccupied space could in theory accommodate most of the projected need. 18.10 The capacity projections suggest there is currently no pressing requirement to allocate sites for major retail development. Not all 241",

However, policies provide enough scope to respond to new investment that cannot be accommodated in vacant units. Some redevelopment, refurbishment and expansion may be required in addition to the reoccupation of vacant units, ideally within town centres to accommodate future investment opportunities. 18.11 The Local Plan no longer includes designated shopping frontages. Instead, Primary Shopping Areas have been defined in the town centres only. Policy also protects specified essential shops and services which are crucial to facilitate Living Locally – a key theme of the Local Plan. 18.12 Even though the evidence base suggests there is a need to re-purpose vacant shops generally, it is also vital to ensure that the borough’s Town Centres, which provide food shopping but also a range of comparison shops, continue to be viable and attractive in this role. Part of the formula for success for these larger centres is to ensure there is a sufficient quantum of comparison shopping floorspace in each town centre. Primary Shopping Areas (PSAs) have been defined, as required by paragraph 86 of the NPPF, for the five town centres only. Resisting the loss of retail floorspace in PSAs supports these centres’ comparison shopping role & fosters a compact retail core which makes browsing easier. New retail development is encouraged to locate within the PSA where one has been defined, in order to consolidate the retail offer within. However, it is recognised that the PSAs are tightly drawn and the Council will apply the sequential test when considering proposals, as set out in the NPPF. 18.13 Each centre in the hierarchy has been individually assessed in the Council’s research report “Assessment of Borough Centres 2023”. The report draws together research and data from numerous sources and took into account the views of the community, in order to review the centre hierarchy, assist in defining PSAs and review and designate new boundaries. 18.14 A Richmond Partnership Conference in 2021 and a series of virtual Community Conversations within each area of the borough, have supported the Council’s approach to unlock the potential of our centres, as becoming destinations beyond shopping to attract and retain visitors, as people-centred places which are appealing to pedestrians, and by using digitalisation creatively. To adapt to meet future needs, it is vital that our centres capitalise on their locally distinctive features, such as the cultural and leisure offer and riverside settings, to provide a sense of place, as set out in relevant place-based strategy in section 5 of this Plan. In particular, Cultural Quarters and clusters are identified in Policy 18 'Development in Centres'. As well as the provision of goods, services and attractions, the public realm within our centres and connections between uses need to encourage people to dwell, with walkable environments. This can be achieved through increased greening, street furniture, public art, event and performance spaces including for temporary and meanwhile uses, as well as infrastructure for visitors such as public toilets and wayfinding. Spaces should be repurposed at different times to serve both the day and night-time economies. As set out in the place-based strategies in section 5 of this Plan, some of these other initiatives may be undertaken by partners that the Council works with to support our centres, including the current Business Improvement Districts and business associations. New Permitted Development Rights 18.15 The Council made a non-immediate Article 4 Direction to remove permitted development rights for a change of use from Class E to residential, which was confirmed in June 2022. Subsequently, the Direction was modified by the Secretary of State and came into force on 29 July 2022. This covers the extent of the borough’s designated centre hierarchy, identified for their contribution to the overall vitality and viability of our centres and recognising the importance of having access to local shops and services to enable Living Locally.

The types of development appropriate in the five town centres comprise retail development (including warehouse clubs, factory outlet centres and markets); leisure, entertainment facilities the more intensive sport and recreation uses (including cinemas, restaurants, drive-through restaurants, bars and pubs, night-clubs, health and fitness centres, indoor bowling centres, and bingo halls); offices; and arts, culture and tourism development (including theatres, museums, galleries and concert halls, hotels and conference facilities). 18.17 Focusing development in the town centres will result in sustainability benefits, including a reduction in the need to travel by car. Therefore, major commercial development should be located within the defined town centre boundaries (with the exception of retail uses which are encouraged to locate within Primary Shopping Areas). 18.18 Several centres are designated wholly or in part as Conservation Areas.The place-based strategies in section 5, and Policy 45 Tall and Mid-Rise Building Zones identify where there is potential for growth.

Adapting to change 18.20 To ensure their long-term stability, it is important that town centres and high streets can adapt to changing consumer demands and behaviours and the challenges posed by the growth in online retail. 18.21 There has been a long established policy approach of limiting the change of use away from retail. The Government introduced a significant change to the Use Classes Order in 2020, which combined several different town centre uses including shops, cafés and restaurants, offices, gyms and health centres into one use class- Class E (commercial, business and service) uses.There is a Class F for community and learning uses. Permission is not required to change between any of the uses within the new Class E. The introduction of Use Class E, in removing the distinction between retail and other non-retail commercial, business and services uses, makes the implementation of this approach challenging in practice; this policy will apply where planning permission is required for a change of use. Notwithstanding this, the Local Plan recognises the benefit of maintaining a concentrated retail core, and therefore has designated Primary Shopping Areas in the larger centres which are the preferred locations for shops on the ground floor of units, and where new retail development is encouraged to locate. 18.22 The NPPF states that, when assessing applications for retail and leisure development outside of town centres which are not in accordance with an up-to-date local plan, local planning authorities should require an impact assessment if the development is over a proportionate locally set threshold. Class E includes a broad range of uses, some of which could have significant detrimental impacts on town centres’ vitality, vibrancy and viability. It is therefore necessary to require impact assessments to assess and mitigate potential impacts where appropriate. All retail and leisure developments over 500 sq.m gross (combined) proposed outside or on the edge of designated town, local and neighbourhood centres are required to prepare an impact assessment, including retail and leisure uses which are part of mixed use proposals. 18.23 Applicants will be expected to comply with the sequential test as set out in national and regional guidance. The NPPF states that a sequential test should be applied to planning applications for main town centre uses which are not in an existing centre nor in accordance with an up-to-date plan. In line with the glossary in the NPPF, Important Local Parades in the centre hierarchy are not considered as a centre in relation to the application of this test. For clarity, extensions for retail and leisure developments (which includes mezzanine floors) of more than 200m2 gross should also comply with the test.The locally-set thresholds relating to the impact and sequential tests set out in the policy reflect the type of generally small scale retail applications that come forward in the borough.

To this end, the Plan seeks to protect a small number of specific shops which are needed for essential top-up shopping or are businesses providing services which generally need to be visited in person, unless there is genuine alternative provision as detailed in Policy 20. Diversifying our centres 18.27 It is recognised that for our centres to continue to thrive, there is a need for diversification and adaptation, including new innovative forms of retailing, accommodating new space where there is identified demand and managing new development and the transition of any surplus retail floorspace to other uses, such as cultural and business. The Council supports the enhancement of quality leisure and cultural uses that contribute to activities during the day and night and appropriately manage the impacts of such uses, in accordance with Policy 19 Managing impacts. 18.28 The spaces within and around our centres can have an important public function, with high streets, public squares, parks, gardens and other open spaces providing opportunities for people to meet and socialise. When considering the quality of place, key factors to be considered are design of shopfronts, accessibility regardless of ability and safe places. The Council will work with partners to promote a quality urban realm by promoting a Healthy Streets approach in developments, as set out in Policy 1 Living Locally. 18.29 The borough has a rich cultural offer, linked with its heritage assets and opportunities for leisure and recreation, providing for residents and visitors, and attracting tourists. The Council’s Culture Richmond 2021 to 2031 sets out the vision for an innovative and sustainable cultural offer, with our arts, library, parks, sport and fitness services more closely aligned to broader culture priorities. Many venues and facilities identified in the place-based strategies in section 5 of this Plan, and on the London Cultural Infrastructure Map. London’s Arcadia including Kew Gardens, parks, historic buildings and landscapes between Hampton Court and Kew along the River Thames are referred to in paragraph 7.5.12 in the London Plan. 18.30 The London Plan Policy HC5 sets out that development plans should identify and promote new, or enhance existing, locally-distinct clusters of cultural facilities, venues and related uses defined as Cultural Quarters; especially where they can provide an anchor for town centre renewal, and identify, protect, and enhance strategic clusters of cultural attractions. Although dispersed across the borough, there are clusters of existing facilities in the town centres. In particular, Richmond and Twickenham have been identified in this Plan as Cultural Quarters, and other centres have existing clusters of cultural facilities and creative industries.These create an attractive and vibrant area for residents, workers and visitors, as well as reflecting the local character and distinctiveness of our places.

Therefore, commercial or community uses will be expected to front the street. There is a growing trend to convert the rear of premises to residential use. Where conversion is acceptable, the access to any residential unit should be from the front rather than the rear where practicable. Any residential proposed will need to address the requirements of other policies in the Plan including Policy 13 Housing Mix and Standards, Policy 46 Amenity and living conditions. 18.32 Residential development contributes to the overall health of centres and to meeting the Borough’s housing target.

Evening economy uses can include food and drink uses, night clubs, live music and/or dance venues and other entertainment activities. Overconcentration of similar uses can have a negative effect on amenity and the general environment, including parking, congestion and safety, and/or affect the vitality and function of a centre. The London Plan encourages boroughs to consider appropriate management strategies and mitigation measures. 18.35 The flexibility introduced by Government through Use Class E (commercial, business and service uses) allows for many changes of use to occur without the need for planning permission. However, some specific uses are classed as Sui Generis, including theatres, pubs and bars, hot food takeaways, cinemas, live music venues, and nightclubs which will require planning permission for new uses or to change to another use. In addition, changes of use to Class E will need to be assessed for the range of potential uses within that class. 18.36 During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government also introduced temporary measures to boost high streets and hospitality which included flexibility to encourage use of outdoor spaces and markets. The Government has made these freedoms permanent, meaning that hospitality businesses no longer need planning permission to put up marquees and other moveable structures on their land and councils will no longer need planning permission to hold an outdoor market. 18.37 Where necessary and justified, the Council will use conditions and/or planning obligations to limit uses consented within Class E in order to achieve the objectives of this policy, to manage the impact of food and drink uses on amenity and the centre, and to avoid the proliferation of main town centre uses outside of town centres; in line with the NPPF and PPG to ensure assessment of impact on the vitality and viability of town centres. 18.38 The London Plan’s Town Centre Network recognises Richmond’s Night-time Economy as NT2, an area of regional/sub-regional significance, with Twickenham and Teddington classed as of more than local significance (NT3).

Over-concentration of uses and amenity impacts 18.39 The impacts of food, drink and entertainment uses on the surrounding area need to be carefully managed as such the main location for food and drink and entertainment uses will be the main town centres. Too many similar uses and concentrations can have a negative effect on amenity and/or the vitality and function of centres. These impacts will also be felt more strongly within smaller commercial areas, given their role and function, as well as the concentration of uses in proximity. 18.40 Such uses can sometimes cause problems to nearby residents and businesses because of noise, fumes, traffic and other disturbances, especially at night.The Council will therefore seek to control the size and location of such premises, particularly where there is residential accommodation adjacent, close to, or above premises. In addition, these amenity problems are exaggerated when groups of these facilities are located close together and their cumulative and combined impact becomes significant. However, there are opportunities with new development to include measures to manage potential amenity impacts, for example through natural surveillance and inclusive access, and to provide an enhanced mix of uses that will contribute to our centres becoming vibrant at different times of the day. 18.41 The Council’s Licensing Policy may also be taken into account, in particular the Special Policy on Cumulative Impact. A revised Statement of Licencing Policy came into effect on 3 January 2022 [(4)] which retains Cumulative Impact Areas in Richmond and Twickenham, for all types of licence. A full review of the special policy was carried out in 2021 to take into account the changes brought about by the Policing and Crime Act 2017 which concluded that there was strong evidence to retain such a policy. The highest concentrations of licensed premises lie within Richmond and Twickenham commercial centres. In adopting the special policy, the authority has set down a strong statement of approach to considering applications for the grant or variation of premises licences in both centres. The Statement of Licencing Policy also considers a range of data from various sources including assaults and anti-social behaviour reported to the police, numbers of alcohol-related ambulance callouts and complaints related to licensed premises. 18.42 Where appropriate, conditions and legal agreements will be applied to protect amenity, such as conditions to control the hours of opening, or crime prevention and safety measures. Agent of Change 18.43 Proposals will be assessed against the ‘agent of change’ principle, as detailed in Policy D13 in the London Plan. For example, if a town centre use is in place before a residential development, as the ‘agent of change’, the residential development is responsible for mitigating the impacts of the existing use. Such impacts can include noise within the premises, smells, light pollution and the impact of those going to and from the facility, such as traffic, car parking and anti-social behaviour. The agent of change principle works both ways. For example, if a new noise-generating use is proposed close to existing noise-sensitive uses the onus is on the new use to ensure it is designed to protect existing users or residents from noise and other impacts. Extensions to existing uses 18.44 This policy applies to significant extensions of floorspace as well as changes of use applications, whether an extension is considered significant will depend upon the total amount proposed and the proportionate increase in floorspace compared to the size of the existing unit.

Some communities may be dependent on one or two businesses to meet essential needs which makes them vulnerable, should those shops or services close. 18.48 There are many services which are vital to wellbeing and functioning of the community including social infrastructure uses such as doctors and medical centres, indoor sport including gyms, pilates and yoga studios and educational facilities which are protected by other policies in the plan, particularly by Policies 49, 50 and 51.The essential services to which this policy relates are those which cannot usually be delivered on-line as they require an in-person visit.These services are very much valued by the community and for many need to be local and convenient. Many of these services are supplied by local, independent businesses. 18.49 The availability of local provision of essential shops and services has a significant role to play in realising a key aim of this Plan – the ability to live locally (Policy 1) and facilitating shorter, regular trips by walking or cycling. The pandemic and associated lockdowns have accelerated changes in the way we shop. However, it has also brought the value of the borough’s centres, parades and isolated shops sharply into focus whose strength is, amongst other things, their convenience. As more people spend more time at home and in their local areas, particularly during the working week, local businesses can capitalise on this additional footfall and spending. 18.50 The evidence suggests that there will be less retail floorspace needed in the future. Previously, policies protected shopping floorspace regardless of what the shop sold. The preferred approach is more focused, resisting the loss of specific types of shops and services which are considered particularly important (and only where there is no genuine alternative within walking distance (400 metres)). This more targeted policy is intended to be applied everywhere in the borough. Where essential shops and services are located within centre boundaries, they add to overall vibrancy and provide a reason for visiting which facilitates linked trips and thus spending in other businesses. Where they are located outside of centres they are equally, if not more important, and may well be vital to meeting need. 18.51 Essential shops and services are defined in the definitions box at the beginning of this chapter. This policy will apply to businesses with a significant proportion of floorspace selling goods which can be found in defined essential shops or provides an essential service. In considering if there is genuine alternative provision available, the Council will take into account whether a similar range of provision and/or type of service is provided elsewhere as per the policy. In implementing this policy the Council will be mindful that the closure of some facilities such as Post Offices and banks may be part of a wider programme of closures. The onus is on the applicant to provide the evidence needed to support an application, including demonstrating that there is no longer any demand for such facilities through a period of robust marketing. 18.52 It is noted that changes of use between uses within Class E of the Use Classes Order do not require planning permission, which limits the scope of this policy’s application. Where planning permission is required the Council may impose conditions to restrict further change of use in the future, for example, to uses that could compromise the viability and vitality of the borough’s centres. Other uses falling outside of Class E, such as community halls or a pub or bar, may also provide enhanced amenities for the local community, and changes to these uses may be supported, where the scale of the provision is justified and appropriate to meet a local need, and it can be demonstrated through a sequential test that the proposal would not harm the vitality and viability of the borough’s centre hierarchy, and subject to appropriate mitigation of any negative amenity impacts (e.g. noise disturbance from a pub or bar). 252 Public houses and bars and drinking establishments",

Public houses (including bars and other drinking establishments for the purposes of this policy) play an important role and social function in the local community, and they add to the local character of an area, and can often be buildings of historical or architectural interest. Many pubs provide a hub for social interaction, cultural identity, heritage and character of an area. Therefore, the Council will resist the loss of public houses. In the supporting text to London Plan Policy HC7, there is guidance on the broad range of characteristics that will be taken into account in assessing whether a pub has heritage, cultural, economic or social value.The listing of a pub as an Asset of Community Value will also be a material planning consideration. Whether there is another within 400 metres; whether the use is inappropriate in terms of access or amenity or living conditions; and whether the proposed new use would provide a social or community service or function which outweighs the loss of the facility, meeting evidence of a local need.The criteria of Policy LP 49 Social and Community Infrastructure will be applied when assessing the loss of a pub. 18.55 Applicants should also have regard to the Campaign for Real Ale’s (CAMRA) Public House Viability Test.",

The continued loss of office stock and industrial land from the borough at past rates is unsustainable. The policy approach in this Plan therefore provides protection against the loss of existing office floorspace and industrial land, encourages its renewal and modernisation, and seeks additional provision, which is vital in terms of local economic and environmental sustainability objectives to create and maintain a sustainable economy. This approach is supported by the Borough Employment Land & Premises Needs Assessment. 19.2 We want to move towards creating a more self-sustaining borough, where education, training and job opportunities are available and all residents have access to those opportunities and other services without the need to travel far, or which are accessible by sustainable forms of transport. Therefore, it is important that employment land is retained close to residential areas to provide a choice of employment opportunities within the borough now and in the future. 19.3 The Council is required to plan positively for employment land by providing support for existing and new employment sectors. This policy seeks to protect existing employment land within our designated employment areas. In the borough context it is common for employment to be within mixed use areas, because of historic development patterns, resulting in it being dispersed across the borough in a fragmented way. However, this does not provide justification for a change of use, as mitigation can address impacts and constraints such as narrow access, which have been managed by existing occupiers, and therefore do not prevent any future or continued employment use. This is also supported by the Agent of Change principle set out in the London Plan Policy D13 and Policy 53 'Local Environmental Impacts'. In addition, changes to ways of working, servicing and delivery do mean the ways businesses operate are changing.The policy approach is to make efficient use of land by encouraging employment-led intensification. Changing work styles 19.4 Structural changes in the way offices are viewed in many growth sectors as places for interaction and collaboration, rather than places to go and work at a fixed desk has resulted in a rise in agile working practices such as working from home, hot desking, and shared workspace models – all of which enable the more efficient use of space.

A new generation of industrial and workshop style provision could also meet future industrial needs but also work for office uses, and be used flexibly as businesses grow and adapt. Richmond is an enterprising borough; with one fifth of the working age population self-employed and more businesses surviving three years compared to elsewhere in London. Overall, the borough has been relatively resilient to the economic pressures of recent years; however, there are some economic challenges, particularly as a result of limited land availability for employment purposes, and a shortage of office space across the borough leads to increases in rental values and costs for local businesses. The promotion of flexible and affordable workspaces allows us to respond to changing business needs and create robust, future-proofed places, including successful town centres and the promotion of local supply chains and local employment hubs which support the spatial strategy and the living locally concept.The Council will support provision of small units to accommodate a variety of local businesses and small firms at existing employment locations and to provide the opportunity for residents to set up their own enterprise, enabling them to work closer to home. 19.5 Proposals for intensification and re-purposing of existing employment land should consider the location and its character. Site proposals should be well designed, readily available and adaptable to meet changing business needs and should have regard to operational requirements (including servicing) and mitigate impacts on the transport network where necessary.

The identified shortfall in the amount of office space in the borough has reduced since the pandemic however there is a positive demand for the Plan period and a limited pipeline of supply. 19.16 London Plan Policy E1 supports diverse office markets in outer London and increases in the current stock of offices in locations such as existing business parks and town centre locations with locally-oriented provision to meet local needs. It also goes on to state that existing viable office floorspace capacity in locations outside these areas should be retained. 19.17 Given the need for office floorspace identified within the borough Employment Land & Premises Needs Assessment, the policy approach to protecting existing office stock will apply where planning permission is required for a change of use, or to extensions and new development. 19.18 The Council will apply this policy to consider the loss of office use, for applications seeking a change of use or redevelopment that requires planning permission (such as to Class F or Class C), if a building has been in an office use (as evidenced in the Town Centre Land Use Survey, business rates or other available evidence). 19.19 Where a proposal involves a change of use not supported by policy, the Council will require satisfactory marketing evidence. An application is expected to set out why it is not suitable for continued commercial, business or service uses, and the site should be marketed both for its existing office use and alternative employment generating uses including as flexible, start-up or co-working space. Prices should be based on the local office market and on the existing quality of the accommodation. A full and proper marketing exercise can be submitted in accordance with the marketing requirements in Appendix 2. Such evidence will be a material consideration, however provision of marketing in itself does not justify an exception to policy. Article 4 Directions 19.20 Offices are now within Use Class E, rather than the former B1(a), to meet government objectives of increasing flexibility for a wider range of uses. It is recognised that this could potentially compromise the ability of the Council to protect existing office space in line with this policy, as well as with the requirements of paragraphs 80 and 81 of the NPPF. Changes of use within Class E are not considered to be development and therefore do not require planning permission. 19.21 The flexibility of Class E should improve the prospects of finding an alternative employment generating use when commercial units become vacant. Class E provides applicants with scope to consider if former offices are able to accommodate light industrial uses, which is encouraged given the continuing shortfall in industrial land in the borough identified in Policy 24 'Industrial Land'. Where necessary and justified, the Council will use conditions and/or planning obligations to limit uses consented within Classes E to (g)(i) or (g)(ii) in order to achieve the objectives of this policy and in line with the NPPF and accompanying PPG to support economic growth and to mitigate the impacts of development given the range of uses that need to be fully assessed. 19.22 In March 2021 government published legislation in England to introduce a new and much broader permitted development right (PDR), Class MA which came into effect on 1 August 2021 for the change of use of properties in the Commercial, Business and Service use class (Class E) to residential (C3), subject to a range of conditions and limitations. 19.23 A modified Article 4 Direction (Class E to C3) came into force on 31 July 2022.

Provision of affordable, flexible and managed workspace is necessary to support small and new businesses including those operating on a not-for-profit basis. The redevelopment and intensification of the borough’s employment sites can offer opportunities for the provision of affordable workspace as part of mixed-use schemes. Affordable workspace 19.40 London Plan policy E3 defines “affordable workspace” as workspace that is provided at rents maintained below the market rate for that space for a specific social, cultural, or economic development purpose. It can be provided and/or managed directly by a dedicated workspace provider, a public, private, charitable or other supporting body; through grant and management arrangements; and/or secured in perpetuity or for a period of at least 15 years by planning or other agreements. 19.41 It is important to note that the increasing focus of the Richmond Borough’s economy lies within activities that are set to drive growth of the London economy such as activities that cut across creative endeavour, digital technology, software, product and content design and small batch production and professional services. Creative industries are an area of specialisation for the borough’s economy. Within this sector the borough stands out in a number of activities: software consultancy, architectural and engineering activities, and advertising. Retail in specialised stores is also significant as are publishing activities, reproduction of video and sound recording and computer media. 19.42 The Borough’s economy is characterised by the large proportion of micro-business units both, as a result of businesses employing <10 employees and of the large proportion of self-employed residents. The current split by business size across the borough identifies that most businesses fall within the SMEs category. There are 13,535 businesses in Richmond of which 93.1% employ fewer than 10 people. This proportion of micro businesses is slightly higher than the London average of 90.8%, with 14.6% of Richmond’s population being self-employed, which is slightly higher than the London average of 11.1%. 19.43 The limited availability of stock in Richmond has hindered the growth aspirations of the workspace market. The Employment Land & Premises Needs Assessment has found that there are few existing providers of workspace in the borough and that these tend to be clustered around Teddington and Richmond town centres. Within the existing provision, most workspaces offer the format of sub-divided office property and co-working space targeted at professional and business services sectors – these may provide flexible terms and other features that appeal to small firms but are still essentially offices.They are located in serviced office buildings like Spaces Teddington, or within institutional buildings like The Bridge Workspace operating out of Richmond and Hillcroft Adult Community College. Although based on limited data, it was found that the rent levels for co-working spaces in the borough were quite high, as can be the case with serviced offices, with levels more equivalent to co-working markets on the fringe of central London, than those of the outer boroughs. The result of this may be that there is a segment of users who are priced out of this market in the borough. 265",

Demand has been identified for a greater diversity of workspaces beyond the standard office format to support a range of sectors across business stages. 19.45 The following priority sectors for the borough have been identified in the evidence: Support micro businesses and small businesses through the provision of flexible office spaces that can accommodate small teams (micro-small businesses), to grow-on premises, and expand to a sizable business within 2-3-5 years.

These workspaces can be designed and managed to support SMEs and will vary depending on the end occupier or sector but must be desirable and support typologies that allow for shared facilities and/or low-cost or managed workspaces, ensuring that they can cater for a range of business needs. Often these include workspace with flexible and/or low-cost rental terms, co-working spaces, incubator spaces, accelerator spaces, creative/artist spaces and makerspaces. Shared facilities could help create workspaces which are more space efficient and more viable as costs can be shared which will promote the collective and efficient use of resources. 19.47 Managed workspaces offer benefits generated by the clustering of a number and range of businesses in one location, as well as the opportunity to incorporate support features that benefit small and new businesses. Features of managed workspaces can vary depending on the provider and sector, but can include business support, networking opportunities, access to financial support, shared spaces and facilities, flexible rent and leasing arrangements and flexible layouts that can be modified as businesses grow. Where managed workspace is being proposed, the details will be secured through a Workspace Management Plan. The Council will expect that a managed workspace provider should be identified at the application stage in order to ensure that it is deliverable, and there should be a long-term commitment to maintaining the managed workspace provision in the development. If an applicant proposes to manage the workspace themselves, they will need to demonstrate how this provision will meet the requirements of the policy through the Workspace Management Plan. Affordable workspace within major developments 19.48 The Council will require the provision of affordable workspace within major developments, where over 1,000sqm of employment floorspace is proposed. Affordable workspace should constitute at least 10% of the proposed employment 266",

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on travel, particularly overseas visitors, and uncertainty has affected the sector. However in the short-term there has been growth in a stronger staycation market, with the Mayor’s recovery plans including a ‘Let’s Do London’ campaign in 2021. There could be a flexible approach to enable temporary uses in exceptional circumstances; however the protection of the existing stock of visitor accommodation is considered vital given the borough’s rich visitor and cultural infrastructure. The Council’s vision for our arts, libraries, parks and sport and fitness services set out in Culture Richmond 2021 – 2031 aims to support the growth of culture and creativity in the borough, while adapting to be resilient. A refreshed Visit Richmond Strategy to support local centres and the visitor economy was agreed to be undertaken by the Council in February 2022, including to invest in a new Visit Richmond marketing campaign. 19.52 The borough is a popular destination for visitors to traditional attractions such as the historic houses and gardens, the River Thames as well as the rugby-related attractions and associated facilities such as restaurants and shops. Parts of both Richmond and Twickenham town centres have existing cultural areas with clusters of existing uses, defined as Cultural Quarters in the theme ‘Shaping and supporting our town and local centres’ that can be a focus for improving the offer to visitors, bringing opportunities to stimulate vibrancy and viability and promote diversity, through linked trips and providing additional public uses (with access secured through a legal agreement) that form a destination as well as providing local job opportunities.The London Plan sets out that the diversity of cultural infrastructure in all parts of London should be conserved, enhanced and promoted, in Policies E10 and HC5. The Council will expect the major attractions including Twickenham Stadium and the Stoop (Harlequins) to be developed in accordance with the Site Allocations set out in this plan. 19.53 The Council will encourage the provision of accommodation to enable visitors to stay longer and spend more. Major new hotel development will be expected to be located within town centres in the first instance as in Policy 18 Development in Centres, which also sets out guidance on the appropriate location and scale of hotel development. London Plan Policy E1 seeks an additional 58,000 bedrooms of serviced accommodation by 2041, with boroughs in outer London expected to plan proactively for new accommodation and the London-wide evidence base reflects boroughs take a share of the London supply projection. The GLA published a Technical Note in 2022 [(5)] which updates hotel accommodation projections. It was recognised that although forecasting was difficult, it was nevertheless expected that tourism would return to its pre-crisis levels by the middle of the decade. Therefore, proposals which increase the number of bedspaces will be supported, subject to other Local Plan policies, where they contribute to meeting the London Plan target. 19.54 The London Plan also requires visitor infrastructure to contribute to improving the availability of accessible serviced accommodation, as vital to ensure that as many visitors as possible can stay in London and experience its visitor attractions and business offer.

It will be taken into account whether any ancillary facilities within the hotel, such as a gym, are open for public use. 19.56 The Council will work with its partners to promote the borough as a tourist destination. It is also recognised that major events held within the borough attract very large numbers of people, and the Council will continue to work with partners, including public transport operators and event organisers, to promote sustainable travel choices and minimise disruption to residents and local businesses where possible. 19.57 In addition, proposals will be assessed in the context of maximising housing delivery, including affordable housing. In existing residential areas, there will need to be consideration whether a proposal for visitor accommodation would compromise capacity to meet the need for conventional dwellings. As set out under Policy 14 Loss of Housing, short-term holiday rented accommodation can be beneficial in providing for short-stays in sustainable locations, such as town centres and areas better served by public transport, however using for more than 90 days a year will be resisted where there is a detrimental impact on the existing housing stock. 19.58 National policy sets out guidance on the provision of high quality communications infrastructure, which is essential for sustainable economic growth.

Therefore, the Council supports telecommunications infrastructure and high speed broadband that ensures the continued economic and social success of the borough, particularly as businesses and local communities rely on access to modern technology. This policy seeks to ensure that new telecommunications infrastructure is sited appropriately and that the number of sites used is minimised where possible. 19.61 It is important to keep the number of masts and sites to a minimum as an over-concentration of equipment and installations can have harmful impacts on the borough's unique and distinctive character. Therefore, there is an expectation that existing masts, buildings and other structures are used wherever possible, which includes sharing facilities with other operators, unless the need for a new site has been justified and accepted by the Council. Where new sites or structures are required, equipment should be sympathetically designed and camouflaged where possible. In addition, the Council supports the removal of redundant telecommunications infrastructure. 19.62 Applications for telecommunications development (including for prior approval under Part 24 of the General permitted Development Order) should have the necessary evidence to justify the proposed development. This includes: The outcome of consultation with organisations with an interest in the proposed development (e.g. if a mast is to be installed near a school); For an addition to an existing mast or base station, a statement that self-certifies that the cumulative exposure of the development will not exceed International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection guidelines; For a new mast or base station, evidence the applicant has examined erecting antennas on an existing building, mast or other structure and a statement that self-certifies that, when operational, International Commission guidelines will be met.",

The Urban Design Study divides the borough into high-level ‘Places’ and lower level ‘Character Areas’, each with its own distinctive character, evolution and series of neighbourhoods. The identification of places has been informed by a comprehensive process involving the analysis of existing planning designations, built form characteristics and historical evolution of areas. The process has also been informed by the existing Village Planning Guidance SPDs. 20.2 The borough-wide characterisation work in the Urban Design Study considers what makes one area distinctive from another, what qualities are significant and critical to local character, and why is a particular townscape or landscape important, and to whom. The characterisation work creates a background against which new development can be balanced with protecting and enhancing what makes Richmond as a borough so special in line with guidance on delivering good design through the planning process in Local Plan Policy 44. It is expected that applicants and developers follow the guidance and advice set out in the Urban Design Study and the Village Planning Guidance SPDs when considering the designand character-led approach to development. Village Planning Guidance SPDs and Conservation Area Appraisals 20.3 Village Planning Guidance SPDs were developed for all areas of the borough, (with the exception of Ham and Petersham, where there is an adopted Neighbourhood Plan for the area).The SPDs identify the key features and characteristics of the village areas that are valued by local communities. Within the SPDs, each area has been subdivided into Conservation Areas and Character Areas, and for each area the context, character and local features have been analysed and assessed. 272",

These focus on protecting and improving the quality of the local built environment and provide the necessary detail to assess context, local character and design quality.The Council will consider producing further supplementary planning document(s) or toolkits to inform small site design expectations on residential-led projects, along with updates to the Design Quality SPD (2006) and Small and Medium Housing Sites SPD (2006). Design quality and character 20.6 This policy requires developers and applicants to take a sensitive approach to the architectural design of new buildings, extensions and modifications to existing buildings, as well as landscape proposals. The Council does not wish to encourage a particular architectural style or approach but expects each scheme to be to a high-quality standard, with very high quality expected within Conservation Areas. Schemes should be based on a sound understanding of the site and its context, following the locally specific guidance set out in the Urban Design Study, complemented by the Village Planning Guidance SPDs.This locally based approach that is sensitive to an area’s character can also contribute to achieving the Council’s objectives relating to climate change, biodiversity and living locally. 20.7 Developments should demonstrate an appreciation and understanding of vernacular, local character and architectural precedents in the local area, whilst not preventing or discouraging appropriate innovation and design. Given the built-up nature of the borough, it is anticipated that most new buildings will be as a result of redevelopment where compatibility with the existing urban fabric is a key consideration. The purpose is to maintain, reinforce and where possible enhance the local character and features that give the area its distinctive and clear identity. Opportunities should be taken to improve the general level of design of an area where appropriate. New development should respect existing street and development patterns. 20.8 Policy D1 of the London Plan addresses the issue of understanding character and context, noting that an understanding of the character of a place helps to ensure an appropriate balance is struck between existing fabric and any proposed change. As change is a fundamental characteristic of London, respecting character and accommodating change should not be seen as mutually exclusive. Materials and façade design 20.9 The Council will expect the use of high-quality and sustainable materials, urban greening and biodiversity features as well as planting and landscaping reflecting the local character and distinctiveness of an area in all schemes where this contributes positively to the appearance and character of an area. The degree of symmetry, variety, colours as well as the pattern and proportions of windows and doors, materiality and their details together influence the design quality and character of a building and place. 20.10 The choice of building materials should mitigate the contribution to the urban heat island effect through thermal radiation as well as release of anthropogenic (waste) heat, having regard to Policy 4 Minimising Greenhouse gas emissions and promoting energy efficiency. Relationship to other buildings 20.11 The space between buildings should be respected and development be in harmony with surrounding buildings. Elements such as windows, roofs, shopfronts and doors should relate to one another in such a way as to maintain or complement the proportions of the surroundings, particularly as expressed in the relationship between solids and voids.

Particular attention needs to be given to the interface between the public and private space and how a development will connect or relate to the wider open space network. 20.12 Modern shop and office layouts should be integrated with the proportions of surrounding development in order to reduce any potential visual impact. Development should be in scale with the adjoining buildings and in proportion with the average street width as defined by building frontages which reflect the urban grain, as required. Where uniform building heights are part of the character of a street it will not normally be appropriate to permit abrupt variations to the general roof line or eaves line, while in other areas irregular building heights may be appropriate. Public realm 20.13 Developments should ensure the public realm is well-designed, safe, accessible, inclusive, attractive, well-connected, related to the local and historic context, and easy to understand, service and maintain, as set out in London Plan policy D8. Proposals should ensure that the public realm enhances the amenity and function of buildings and the design of buildings contributes to a vibrant public realm. This includes having active frontages at ground floor, with the main access provided along the frontage facing primary streets. Depending on the development and its location, public realm and public spaces should support a wide variety of activities and create places where people want to go to, meet and socialise. Public realm and public places directly contribute to local identity and character. Applicants should refer to the detailed guidance in the Council’s Public Space Design Guide. 20.14 For a mixed-use scheme, it is preferred that the ground floor contains commercial or community uses, having regard to the location of the site. Where practicable, buildings with ground floor non-residential use should supplement the existing public realm through the incorporation of public spaces such as plazas at their entrance. In case of tall buildings located close to the street edge, proposals should incorporate measures to soften their edges and provide positive public spaces at their base through the use of generous walkways and mature planting. Access and layout 20.15 New development, including new routes and access arrangements, should be appropriately integrated with the existing area, street frontage and existing local routes. The applicant will have to demonstrate how new development relates to the existing public transport, pedestrian and cycle networks and how it fosters social inclusion. Where required, development proposals should maintain through-access for ease of pedestrian movement and permeability. 20.16 Gated developments, which prevent permeability of sites, will be resisted and pedestrian and cycle links through new development must be publicly accessible at all times. Secured by Design 20.17 The Secured by Design scheme has proven results in reducing crime and fear of crime, resulting in significant reductions in burglaries and criminal damage on new build and major refurbishment projects. The scheme is also successful in reducing anti-social behaviour through a wide range of measures including robust communal door standards, access control and careful design and layout of new homes. Applicants are encouraged to consult with the Metropolitan Police designing out crime officers at the earliest opportunity and include details of security and Secured by Design compliance within Design and Access Statements. Microclimate and lighting 20.18 Consideration should also be given to the local microclimate created by buildings. Well informed design decisions at an early stage, such as the orientation of a building, can reduce energy consumption through responding positively to climatic conditions. The design should avoid lighting features that negatively impact on biodiversity or surrounding buildings (particularly residential), as well as on night-time vistas and panoramas.

Co-location and compatibility 20.20 Proposals should demonstrate that the proposed uses and activities are suitable and compatible with each other and surrounding land uses.

The Council will give consideration to the mix of uses proposed and how they will support and connect with the local area through the layout, design and management of the site. Suitable uses will depend on the location and could include a combination of residential, retail, office, leisure and entertainment uses. It is not always necessary to include residential within a mixed scheme, and in some circumstances the inclusion of residential might impact on the operation of other uses. Shopfronts and shop signs 20.21 Shopfronts of architectural or historic interest make an important contribution to the character and appearance of the borough. Therefore, the Council will resist the removal of shopfronts of architectural or historic interest. The design of new, and alterations to existing, shopfronts is important both to the appearance of the individual property and to the character and appearance of its local area. Any proposal will therefore be assessed against relevant guidance in the Urban Design Study and Village Planning Guidance SPDs, as well as the Shopfronts SPD. 20.22 Poorly sited or badly designed shop signs, including projecting signs, and illumination can have a detrimental effect on the amenity (including character and appearance) of an area; on the living conditions of residents; on biodiversity and protected species, and may raise issues of public safety. Security shutters can impact on the visual appearance of an area and can create a hostile environment. The Council will welcome proposals from groups of shops to add character to the street scene by the use of harmonious high- quality design, colours and materials for their shopfronts.

However, it can also cause considerable damage to visual amenity by cluttering the built environment and detracting from the quality of the area. Advertisements (defined under the Town and Country Planning Control of Advertisements Regulations) include not only hoardings, but also devices such as blinds and canopies with lettering, flags with logos and balloons. In considering proposals for an advertising hoarding or other advertisement, including blinds and canopies where relevant, or in deciding whether to take action to remove an existing advertisement, the Council will have regard to the following criteria: 1. hoardings should be of good design and in scale with their surroundings and be of a temporary nature only; 2. any advertisement display must not have an adverse effect upon road traffic conditions and public safety; 3. advertising displays will not be permitted where they would have an adverse effect upon: a Conservation Area; listed buildings or Buildings of Townscape Merit; views from or within open spaces or along the Thames riverside and its tributaries; 275",

Insensitive alterations to, or extensions to neighbouring developments of, listed buildings will not be allowed. 20.35 Listed buildings are best used for their original purpose and therefore the Council will resist the change of use of a listed building where this would harm its significance in relation to heritage interest and character. It is acknowledged that there may be circumstances where the original use has become obsolete and there may be cases where a change of use may be the only viable option to keep the designated heritage asset in active use. In such instances, the Council will take into account the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of the heritage asset and putting it to a viable use consistent with its conservation. Where a change of use may be appropriate, sensitive adaptation of a historic building can be possible, but the onus will be on the applicant to justify the new use and to demonstrate how the benefits outweigh the harm of departing from other planning policies if applicable. Any proposed development, additional structures or buildings within the setting of the designated heritage asset, must only be the minimum necessary to secure the asset’s long-term future. The applicant will also have to demonstrate that the new use will be compatible with the fabric, exterior, interior and setting of the designated heritage asset, and that it will not detract from other evidential, historic, aesthetic or communal heritage values. 20.36 Historic buildings have often survived for many generations; they are inherently sustainable having been, in most cases, well-constructed from high-quality, locally sourced materials. Their embodied energy (i.e. the energy expended and encapsulated within the fabric of a building in its construction) means that it is logical to retain and reuse them with sensitive and careful management. Given the ever-increasing challenges presented by the climate emergency, there is a need to ensure all our buildings, whether historic or modern, are more energy efficient. Applicants are strongly encouraged to consider strategies for saving energy in historic buildings whilst avoiding any potential damages to the structure or heritage value, or impacting the setting of, historic buildings. Each proposal will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, and depending on the significance of an asset, different levels of change may be appropriate in different types of buildings. Any strategies or technologies that don’t harm the building’s heritage value should be maximised. There are often simple and inexpensive measures to reduce energy consumption, such as reinstating existing and missing shutters and draught-proofing windows and doors through the use of sympathetic secondary glazing. Government regulations, research by Historic England as well as Building Regulations all suggest that substantial energy savings can be achieved without harming the heritage value of a building. For further information and guidance see Historic England’s guidance on “Energy Efficiency and Historic Buildings: How to Improve Energy Efficiency 2018” and “Energy Efficiency and Traditional Homes 2020”. 20.37 It is acknowledged that some proposals may require residential development to support the restoration and reuse of designated heritage assets; however, such proposals must have benefits that outweigh the disbenefits of departing from other planning policies.The proposed development must be the minimum necessary to secure the designated heritage asset’s long-term future. 20.38 Legislation places upon those who own or manage listed buildings an obligation to ensure that they are properly maintained. 279",

The Council's Buildings of Townscape Merit SPD adopted 2015 sets out the criteria that will be taken into account when considering whether a building or structure should be designated as BTM.This policy sets out a presumption against the demolition of BTMs unless structural evidence has been submitted by the applicant, and independently verified at the cost of the applicant. Should demolition prove necessary, a high standard of design that complements the surrounding area will be required in any replacement building. Locally specific guidance on design and character is set out in the Conservation Area Appraisals, the Urban Design Study and the Council's Village Planning Guidance SPDs, which applicants are expected to follow for any alterations and extensions to existing BTMs, or for any replacement structures. 20.41 In addition to the borough’s 14 Historic Park and Gardens that are on the Historic England Register of Historic Parks and Gardens (see Policy 29 on Designated Heritage Assets), there are a number of historic parks and gardens that merit local listing due to their historic interest.

A number of locally important views are identified in Policy 31 Views and vistas and on the Policies Map. 20.55 Archaeological investigations in the borough to date have revealed evidence of prehistoric, Roman, Saxon, Medieval and post Medieval archaeology. An archaeological site is a place (or group of physical sites) in which evidence of past activity is preserved and can include industrial sites, marine and foreshore deposits/structures, buildings, machinery, roads, artefacts, wartime structures and modest domestic buildings.The preservation of archaeological remains is a material consideration when determining planning applications. As set out in national policy guidance, archaeological remains of national importance should be preserved in situ.While it is desirable to treat all remains in this manner, it is recognised that it is not always practical to do so. 20.56 However, regardless of their status, established procedures of consultation and evaluation as set out in national policy guidance and other advice must be followed in preparing development proposals. Prospective applicants should make an initial assessment of the archaeological potential and significance of a site by consulting with the appropriate specialist bodies, Historic England and the Greater London Archaeological Advisory Service (GLAAS). GLAAS is the borough’s archaeological adviser and should be consulted with regard to archaeological matters. 20.57 Archaeological Priority Areas (APAs) can be identified by local planning authorities under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and the borough's APAs are shown on the Archaeological Constraints Map. The borough's APAs have been reviewed by GLAAS as part of a rolling programme of reviews across London.

Urban greening entails more than just focusing on how the streets, buildings and other public spaces look. Roofs and walls covered in plants, street trees and small pocket parks in between buildings make our borough an even better place to live, work and invest. These green features act as part of the borough’s green infrastructure network to help clean our air, reduce the risk of flooding and keep the city cool. 21.3 21.2 The borough is characterised by extensive areas of open land, designated as Green Belt and Metropolitan Open Land. The borough's rivers and their corridors link across borough boundaries and have a strategic function in southwest London, Greater London and beyond. The borough also benefits from highly significant historic landscapes, including those on the Historic England’s national Register of Parks and Gardens, all of which make a significant contribution to the borough’s green infrastructure network. In addition, there are many smaller pieces of open land, including land designated as Other Open Land of Townscape Importance, as well as non-designated land, such as 288 residential gardens. Therefore, the green spaces and green and blue features that contribute to and make up the overall green infrastructure network range from borough-wide and strategic features such as parks, watercourses and woodlands to local features such as playgrounds, sports pitches, allotments, public open spaces, trees, woodlands, private gardens and other green spaces used for recreational purposes.There are also other features such as highway verges, railway embankments as well as site-specific elements such as green roofs and green walls that are considered to be part of the wider green infrastructure network. It is important to recognise that the borough's parks and open spaces provide not only recreational opportunities for those that live and work in this borough, but also for local communities and residents in neighbouring and other London boroughs, thus providing a green lung for southwest London. As set out in the Local Plan’s spatial strategy (see Policy 2 'Spatial Strategy: Managing change in the borough (Strategic Policy)'), housing delivery and the infrastructure required to support it, is expected to be met without compromising the green and blue infrastructure network; there is a presumption against the loss of, or building on, greenfield sites. The leisure and recreational pressure on existing green infrastructure, including nationally and internationally designated areas such as Richmond Park and Bushy and Home Park, is acknowledged, and residential development is likely to exacerbate this pressure.There will be challenges in ensuring that the Council reaps all the benefits of having high quality, well maintained open",

The multifunctional nature of green and blue infrastructure means it contributes significantly to the value of the local area as a place to live, work, do businesses and visit. With the decline of biodiversity across the globe, it is vitally important that new features do not only offer 21.6 a ‘green space’ but provide value by forming part of a larger ecosystem, helping to maintain biodiversity. For example, green corridors can be safeguarded for biodiversity by carefully considering any physical infrastructure installed, such as reducing the extent of artificial lighting where possible to protect species of bat present in the borough (see Policy 39 'Biodiversity and Geodiversity' and Policy 43 'Floodlighting and Other External Artificial Lighting '). Policy 8 'Flood Risk and Sustainable Drainage (Strategic Policy) ' also sets out that the Council encourages the return of currently engineered riverbanks to a more natural state where this is possible, which will in turn improve the quantity and quality of natural habitat in these locations. Green and blue infrastructure plays a significant role in both mitigating and adapting to climate change, with the ability for green infrastructure to capture and sequester carbon and pollutants within the vegetation and soils being perhaps the most crucial. 21.5 Green and blue infrastructure networks and features that make up the overall network can also support healthier and more active lifestyles by providing green routes for 289 walking and cycling, green spaces for recreation, exercise and play. Pedestrian and cycle routes across green spaces often form a strategically important part of the borough’s cycling and walking. These routes enable active travel choices by connecting key destinations in the borough via convenient shortcuts and quiet routes away from busy roads.The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the importance of having access to green spaces within walking distance of homes. Pedestrian and cycle routes through green spaces should be protected and, wherever possible, provided to a high standard in accordance with best practice guidance. During the COVID-19 pandemic, visits to parks and other green spaces increased across London. It is important to protect and enhance the existing areas of open space in the borough, to ensure that as the population grows, there are good quality green spaces for everyone to enjoy. The borough’s network of green and blue infrastructure is critically important in helping to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change within the borough, given that areas of open water within the borough’s river corridors, other wetland habitats and green spaces help to reduce the urban heat island effect by promoting urban cooling and reducing localised air temperatures. Green space areas also provide important storm water retention opportunities by minimising surface water run-off rates during severe rainfall storm events, and trees within the borough’s green and/or wildlife or ecological corridors help promote urban cooling. Trees also provide increased shade cover during summer heatwaves and reduce levels of particulate urban air pollution.They also play a key role in helping to store carbon. Rising summer temperatures, prolonged summer heatwaves, and flash flooding due to severe extreme storm events are all likely to increase in frequency in London over the coming years as a result of climate change. The presence of a network of green spaces may reduce the likelihood of flooding by allowing water to permeate through the ground. Green infrastructure can also be designed to act as flood storage areas, holding large volumes of water in temporary ponds to protect built",

The Review demonstrated that eleven MOL sites did not score as highly against the London Plan MOL criteria.

The Review also demonstrated that a small number of sites have been deliberately mismanaged to try and reduce their value and purpose of MOL; however, this is not a reason to amend or remove their designation. The Review identified two relatively small linear parcels comprising front gardens to residential properties along Hampton Court Road; these are recommended to be removed from MOL. In addition, the Review has identified that one site, i.e. Carpark for Sainsburys, Uxbridge Road, Hampton, scored weakly against all the criteria for MOL designation; the Council proposes to release this from MOL and allocate for 100% on-site affordable housing (see Site Allocation 5). In accordance with the NPPF and London Plan, any alterations to the boundary of MOL should be undertaken through the Local Plan process, in consultation with the Mayor and adjoining boroughs. MOL boundaries should only be changed in exceptional circumstances when this is fully evidenced and justified, taking into account the purposes for including land in MOL as set out in the London Plan. 21.15 Where a development proposal affects designated Green Belt or MOL, the applicant is required to submit an assessment that compares the footprint and floorspace of existing structures and buildings with the footprint and floorspace of the proposed development. This will enable the Council to make an informed judgement in relation to the overall impact on, and potential loss of, designated Green Belt or MOL. Any increase in either footprint or floorspace within designated Green Belt or MOL will need to be fully justified by the applicant. 21.16 Development that involves the loss of Green Belt or MOL in return for the creation of new open space elsewhere will not be supported. However, where a comprehensive approach to redevelopment can be taken, such as on major schemes or regeneration proposals that deliver significant wider public benefits, it may be acceptable to re-distribute the designated open land within the site, provided that the new open area is equivalent to or improved in terms of quantum, quality and openness. The applicant will need to demonstrate this as part of the justification that ‘very special circumstances’ may exist. 21.17 Enhancement to the Green Belt or MOL for example by landscaping, removal or replacement of inappropriate fencing and screening, and reduction of the visual impact of traffic or car parking, as well as opening up views into and out of the Green Belt or MOL will be encouraged. Where possible, opportunities to increase the Green Belt's or MOL’s potential for wildlife should be maximised. 21.18 Local Green Space, identified on the Policies Map, is green or open space which has been demonstrated to have special qualities and hold particular significance and value to the local community which it serves.

Areas designated as Other Open Land of Townscape Importance (OOLTI) form an important part of the multi-functional network of green infrastructure and they can include public and private sports grounds, school playing fields, cemeteries, allotments, private gardens, areas of vegetation such as street verges and mature trees. New areas for OOLTI designation can only be identified when a plan is being prepared or reviewed. The existing designated areas are shown on the Policies Map. 21.22 A review of all the land designated as Green Belt, MOL, LGS (see Policy 35 'Green Belt, Metropolitan Open Land and Local Green Space ') and OOLTI was carried out, providing an up to date, objective and evidence-based assessment of how the currently protected areas contribute to the purposes / criteria set out in the relevant national/regional or local policy guidance.The Open Land Review (Green Belt, MOL, LGS and OOLTI) (2021, and Errata 2023) found that most of the OOLTI sites scored moderately or strongly overall, and therefore no changes to existing OOLTI designations are proposed. The Council is however taking forward the designation of one new OOLTI site. 21.23 In some parts of the borough, open areas, including larger blocks of back gardens, act as pockets of greenery of local rather than strategic significance. Many of these are of townscape importance, contributing to the local character and are valued by residents as open spaces in the built-up area. Green oases are particularly important in areas of higher density development including in the borough's centres, also for their importance and value to biodiversity (see Policy 39 'Biodiversity and Geodiversity'). 21.24 OOLTI should be predominantly open or natural in character.The following criteria are taken into account when defining OOLTI (note that the criteria are qualitative and not all need to be met): Contribution to the local character and/or street scene, by virtue of its size, position and quality. Value to local people for its presence and openness. Immediate or longer views into and out of the site, including from surrounding properties. Contribution to a network of green spaces and green infrastructure as set out in Policy 34 Green and Blue Infrastructure.

An update to the Open Space Assessment was published in April 2023. The Playing Pitch and Outdoor Sports Assessment and Strategy is being reviewed and will be updated in 2023. These, together with the site-specific open space and play space needs assessments for major developments, will provide the starting point for assessing any proposals that could lead to a loss of, or could impact on, existing facilities. 21.28 Open spaces, play spaces and sport and recreation facilities are important components of social infrastructure. The Council will not support gated or segregated developments and major development proposals should strike a balance between on-site private amenity space, semi-private and publicly accessible provision.There is an expectation for play spaces to be made publicly accessible, which may also assist in addressing the need for on-site Public Open Space provision. This will also contribute to creating inclusive environments and developments that integrate with existing neighbourhoods and local communities, thus fostering social cohesion. 21.29 Richmond Public Health has published a Physical Activity Plan 2021-2031, which seeks to increase opportunities for physical activity within the Borough. The extensive provision of parks and open spaces in the borough, including formal and informal land and facilities for sport and recreation, close to homes and places of work, will contribute to encouraging healthier lifestyles as well as increased walking and cycling with consequential health benefits.The emphasis is on enabling people to fit physical activity into their daily lives, including promoting active travel as a form of travel to and from leisure and fitness activities, as part of the approach set out in Policy 1 'Living Locally and the 20-minute neighbourhood (Strategic Policy)'. Parks and open spaces are particularly important in promoting activity in young children, thereby targeting the increasing childhood obesity levels in the borough. Culture Richmond 2021 to 2031 sets out that the Council will work with our borough’s wide range of sports clubs and facilities to maintain high levels of participation amongst young people and consider how our partners can help get more residents more active. Easy access for all residents to high quality Public Open Space, play space and other land for formal or informal recreation is important, particularly within identified areas of deficiency. Public Open Space 21.30 The borough benefits from many open and green spaces that contribute greatly to its unique environment, distinctive character and recreational opportunities. This policy seeks to maintain, and where possible improve, the quality and provision of, Public Open Space in the borough. In areas identified as being deficient in Public Open Space, as shown on the Policies Map, there is a requirement for new major developments to provide new on-site open space to alleviate the recreational pressures arising from future occupants and users on existing open spaces while also providing new space for nature and biodiversity. Providing new open spaces as part of development would mitigate potential impacts of likely increased visitor and user numbers of existing established open spaces and parks designated for biodiversity purposes, such as Richmond Park or Wimbledon Common Special Area of Conservation, thereby retaining their integrity as wildlife sites. 21.31 There is no formula for calculating the provision of on-site Public Open Space. The aim is to achieve an appropriate balance alongside the provision of private and semi-private spaces. Implementing fixed standards could undermine the ability to achieve development proposals that maintain, and where appropriate enhance, the character of an area. It is the overall design and layout, taking all factors into account, including different uses and occupiers, design quality and inclusiveness, that will determine the appropriate balance between on-site private amenity space, semi-private and publicly accessible provision. Regardless of the type of open space provision, it should be designed with nature conservation and 303",

Catchment mapping should be treated as an approximation as it does not take account of topography, and it may be appropriate to consider if a distance is on an incline or decline. 21.34 New major developments will lead to increases in usage and are therefore highly likely to put an additional burden and pressure on the capacity of the existing provision. By using the accessibility standards as set out in the paragraph below as well as the designated areas of Public Open Space deficiency, applicants should provide an analysis of existing open space provision relevant to the development site. 21.35 Major developments in Public Open Space deficiency areas will be required to provide new on-site open space. For all other major developments, where there is inadequate existing provision, or limited access to such facilities, to serve the new development, on-site Public Open Space will be expected in order to mitigate the impacts of the new development on the existing provision. In line with the Council's Open Space Assessment 2023, and informed by the Fields in Trust guidelines, the following accessibility standards will be applied for assessing travel to open space provision from new development sites: 9-minute walk time (710m) - for Parks and Gardens 9-minute walk time (710m) - for Natural and Semi-natural Greenspace 21.36 It is acknowledged that on-site provision may not be feasible or practicable on occasions, but this will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking account of the existing open space provision relevant to the development site. Where it has been accepted by the Council that on-site provision cannot be made, the Council will expect existing surrounding open spaces to be improved, and where appropriate made more accessible to the users and occupiers of the new development. Financial contributions may be required to either fund new off-site provision, or improvements and enhancements of existing facilities, including access arrangements, in order to mitigate the impacts of new development. Play space 21.37 This policy seeks to maintain, and where possible improve, the children’s and young people’s play facilities in the borough. As set out in the Council's Open Space Assessment 2023, the borough is generally well served with play spaces that are of high quality. 21.38 New development, where the estimated child occupancy is ten children or more, could lead to increased usage of, and therefore place additional burdens and strains on, existing facilities. Consequently, developers for major applications will be required to submit a child occupancy assessment in line with the GLA’s child yield calculator as advised in the Planning Obligations SPD. Where the assessment demonstrates an estimated child occupancy of ten children or more, the development proposal should make appropriate and adequate provision of dedicated on-site play space by following the London Plan benchmark standard of 10sqm per child. 21.39 In addition, the applicant should provide an assessment of the existing provision of play space within reasonable walking distance from the site. In line with the London Plan, reasonable walking distances for assessing play space requirements are: 304",

Financial contributions may however be required to either fund new off-site provision, or improvements and enhancements of existing facilities, including access arrangements, to mitigate the impacts of new development. 21.41 Further guidance on the appropriate level of provision for play and informal recreational spaces in developments is set out in the Mayor’s 'Supplementary Planning Guidance on Shaping Neighbourhoods: Play and Informal Recreation'. Playing fields, playing pitches and sport 21.42 This policy seeks to protect all public and private sports grounds including playing fields, playing pitches, recreational areas, outdoor swimming pools, outdoor 'green gyms', courts and greens, along with their supporting ancillary facilities such as pavilions providing changing rooms and storage, as well as private open space in recreational use. Such facilities and spaces make a significant contribution to the borough's unique character, openness and the wider green infrastructure network. Enhancements and improvements to existing facilities, including new, extended or enhanced community use, are encouraged.The Playing Pitch and Outdoor Sports Assessment and Strategy 2023 highlights increasing demand in a number of sports and a need to make better use of new and existing sites. Monitoring the Playing Pitch Strategy is undertaken at least annually in the form of publishing updated Action Plans, usually every 6 months, to monitor the delivery of recommendations and highlight emergent issues and opportunities. 21.43 Proposals that could affect the loss or the quality of a playing field will be assessed against the borough-wide Playing Pitch Strategy, the criteria as set out in the NPPF as well as the Sport England Policy on planning applications for development on playing fields. Early engagement with Sport England will be required where a proposal affects a playing field or sports pitch. 21.44 The Council will resist the loss of a playing field unless the proposal meets the exceptional circumstances test as set out in the Sport England policy. Where a proposal involves the loss, or impact on the size or quality of a playing pitch, the applicant must submit a full assessment demonstrating how the relevant guidance, policies and criteria have been addressed. There is also an expectation that overall, the development will deliver an increase and enhancement of sports facilities, as well as, the provision of wider public benefits, including public access, therefore enabling and promoting physical activity and encouraging healthier lifestyles and habits for all ages. 21.45 It is recognised that private sports facilities assist in meeting the wider sports needs of this borough as well as other neighbouring boroughs. Owners of private facilities are encouraged to make them available for public access and use, which can bring benefits to both the host creating vibrant community hubs as well as benefits for user groups and individuals. Community use agreements will be sought to secure community access, that is accessible and affordable, particularly where this will address impacts arising out of a development. An agreement will include how opportunities for wider community access will be managed and maintained, as set out in the supporting text to Policy 49 'Social and Community Infrastructure (Strategic Policy)'.This should include details of the facilities available (including ancillary provision e.g. changing rooms) and how access will be managed (for both clubs and/or individuals), the hours and days available/unavailable, any particular needs the proposal will be catering for (e.g. women’s or juniors), affordable pricing, and whether provision is floodlit (where applicable to the site).These details will be required as part of an application, to provide certainty and enable a detailed consideration of the benefits of any community use to be assessed as part of the determination of an application.

The policy introduces the use of an Urban Greening Factor (UGF) to evaluate the quantity and quality of urban greening provided by a development proposal. It enables major developments to demonstrate how they have included urban greening as a fundamental element of site and building design, in order to meet London Plan Policy G5 Urban greening. A UGF calculator has been prepared to help applicants calculate the UGF score of a scheme and present the relevant information as part of their application. 21.51 The London Borough of Richmond upon Thames has not yet developed its own UGF, and therefore the minimum benchmarks in this policy may be subject to change in the future (such as through the development of an Urban Greening or similar SPD, based on local evidence and need). The benchmarks should be seen as minimum and not the maximum required. 21.52 The provision of urban greening can help to address other London Plan policies. However, the UGF tool should not be used to demonstrate compliance with these other policies as they will also need to be addressed in their own right. 21.53 Given the nature of Richmond borough and that the majority of development will come forward on small sites, it will be important that these sites also contribute to the provision of additional green infrastructure in the borough. 307",

Green roofs 21.55 Green roofs are an essential sustainable design consideration and can take many forms in order to maximise their benefits in a given location. They have many benefits, including the following: 1. adaptation to climate change and reduction in urban heat island effects (i.e. aiding cooling); 2. mitigation of climate change and carbon savings (i.e. aiding energy efficiency); 3. enhancement of biodiversity and provision of important refuges for wildlife in urban areas; 4. provision of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) to avoid rapid rain run-off into drains and rivers and improve water quality; 5. provision of green space and potentially accessible roof space; 6. improvements to visual appearance; 7. enhanced roof and sound insulation properties and resilience of the building; 8. enhanced roof lifespan by protecting underlying waterproofing systems; 9. reduction in air and noise pollution; and 10. growing food. 21.56 Green roofs must be considered at the earliest possible stage of designing a proposal to ensure their effective operation. They must be designed to: 1. maximise benefits for biodiversity, sustainable urban drainage, urban cooling and urban air quality enhancements; 2. promote ecological diversity including planting based on UK native species wildflowers and shrubs to help support native wildlife species, in line with priorities set out in the Richmond Biodiversity Action Plan; 3. achieve maximum biodiversity/climate change benefits by ensuring the depth of substrate/ soil on green roofs is between 80mm to 150mm in depth. Substrate depths below 80mm will only be considered acceptable in very exceptional circumstances where there is robust and credible evidence in place to demonstrate why minimum substrate depths cannot be delivered; 4. deliver measurable net gains for biodiversity and, where appropriate, balance this with the provision of multi-functional roof garden green space areas that may be accessible by occupiers of the building as well as the local community; 5. accommodate surface water storage during severe rainfall storm events to help minimise surface water run-off; 6. provide for long-term maintenance and management, including provisions for inspection and monitoring the quality of the green roof. 21.57 Biodiverse green roofs are the Council’s clear priority in terms of green roof provision as these will play a more effective role in helping to tackle the climate emergency and help support biodiversity. The installation of intensive or semi-intensive green roofs to provide amenity space will only be acceptable where it is clearly demonstrated that this is required to meet other policy requirements, and where the primary biodiversity, sustainable drainage and cooling functions of the green roof will not be adversely affected. Dedicated areas of biodiversity-based planting must be maximised on intensive or semi-intensive green roofs and amenity space must not cover the majority of roof space. 21.58 Major developments are encouraged to consider tree planting and food growing opportunities within green roof designs where feasible. 308",

Strong protection should be given to sites of metropolitan and borough-wide importance, and commensurate protection should be given to sites of local importance. 21.65 All development, particularly for new and replacement buildings and extensions to buildings, should utilise opportunities to attract new species to a site.This can include the incorporation of artificial nest boxes and bricks in buildings to provide nesting and roosting opportunities for birds, including species under threat such as swifts, house martins, swallows and house sparrows, and where appropriate, bats. Swift bricks integrated into new buildings at a ratio of one nest brick per dwelling on average are preferred, as these are suitable for multiple bird species. As outlined in the National Planning Practice Guidance, these relatively small features can achieve important benefits for wildlife. Applicants will be expected to provide details of such features as part of planning applications, in line with best practice guidance. 21.66 Where development proposals could affect or harm a European Protected Species or its habitat, the application will be assessed against the Habitats Regulations, and should planning permission be approved, then the developer is required to independently obtain a licence from Natural England. Where ecological surveys and assessments are undertaken, developers should make all ecological data available to Greenspace Information for Greater London (GiGL) – the capital’s environmental records centre. 21.67 Biodiversity, including the wider ecological and green infrastructure networks, play a crucial role in adapting to the effects of climate change. Biodiversity enhances and enriches the borough's landscapes and wildlife and makes a significant contribution to the distinctiveness of this unique borough, providing a sense of place, cultural heritage, tranquillity as well as opportunities for recreation and a healthier lifestyle. In addition, protecting and enhancing biodiversity, including the provision of new habitats and features, increases the resilience of our ecosystems and helps the physical environment to change and adapt to different stresses. 21.68 This policy recognises that biodiversity interest is not just confined to designated nature conservation areas. Outside designated areas, including on previously developed land or brownfield land, there is an abundance of biodiversity features and habitats, including trees, hedges, wildlife gardens, allotments, ponds, green roofs, living walls, nesting and roosting boxes, swift and bat boxes. Darkness is also important to wildlife, and species that are nocturnal and adapted and/or dependent on dark environments are particularly sensitive to light pollution, for example from security and amenity lighting from adjacent developments (also see Policy 43 ‘Floodlighting and other external artificial lighting’). 21.69 The promotion of nature conservation should be treated as integral to any new development scheme, not as an ‘add-on’. Layout, design, buildings, external lighting and landscaping schemes should take account of existing biodiversity features and habitats, and where applicable the need for maintaining dark environments. New development should include new or enhanced features and habitats, design (such as green roofs) and landscaping (including trees) that promote biodiversity, including provision for their management.These features must also be protected during construction works, and this may be subject to a planning condition as will subsequent maintenance and monitoring. 21.70 Sites of Importance for Natural Conservation (SINCs), priority habitats and other ecological features outside of the SINCs network will be protected. Developments should achieve biodiversity net gain, wherever feasible and appropriate. Opportunities to enhance existing habitats and create new habitats for priority species should be maximised. Developments within areas of nature deficiency should include features to enhance biodiversity, particularly for priority species and habitats. 312",

Development should aim to create net gains in biodiversity, leaving the natural environment in a better state than before. Biodiversity Net Gain 21.72 Biodiversity net gain is an approach which aims to leave the natural environment in a better state than it previously was. The Council will require development proposals to maximise biodiversity benefits and ecological connectivity through ensuring that biodiversity is a key consideration early in the design process. 21.73 The Council requires developments to incorporate new biodiversity features and habitats into the design of buildings themselves as well as in appropriate design and landscaping schemes of new and/or redevelopments (including surrounding areas where appropriate) with the aim to attract wildlife and promote biodiversity where possible. This is particularly important in areas with less access to areas of nature conservation importance. Therefore, proposals should seek to include: 1. habitat restoration, re-creation and expansion; 2. improved links between existing sites; 3. buffering of existing important sites and features, such as railway lines; 4. new biodiversity features within development; and 5. securing management for long term enhancement. 21.74 The overall priority is to secure the inclusion of on-site Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) enhancement features. The baseline for establishing 20% BNG requirements will be identified and achieved by undertaking a walkover survey (undertaken by an accredited ecologist) of the proposed development site. Losses and gains as a result of proposed development will be calculated using the national Biodiversity Metric. Biodiversity net gain complements and works with the biodiversity mitigation hierarchy set out in the NPPF. Any biodiversity net gain delivered as part of a compensation strategy for development should be in addition to the protection for designated sites, protected or priority species and irreplaceable or priority habitats. 21.75 In accordance with the Environment Act 2021, development will need to comply with the following principles and guidance: The latest and most appropriate Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) metric or agreed equivalent should be used to quantify the baseline and post-development biodiversity value of the development site and off-site areas proposed for habitat creation. Natural England’s Small Sites Metric will be appropriate for most small-scale householder applications as well as other minor development, whilst the Biodiversity Metric 3.1 (or later versions) should be used for other applications for development. Development proposals should also follow the good practice principles for development set out by the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management (CIEEM). Major new developments: should result in no net loss in biodiversity value, as assessed against the DEFRA biodiversity offsetting metric, the Environment Bank Biodiversity Impact Calculator or any metric which the Council subsequently adopts formally; are required to submit a Biodiversity Net Gain plan to set out how the baseline biodiversity value has been calculated and how the net gain target will be achieved; The plan must demonstrate that the ‘post-development’ biodiversity value of the development is greater than ‘pre-development’ biodiversity value by at least 20%. are required to submit a 30-year management plan, detailing how the post-development biodiversity values of the site and any 313",

Small-scale development proposals should avoid encroachment within rear garden spaces.The Council will remove Permitted Development Rights from all proposals that require planning permission to protect residential gardens, which contribute substantially to the total green space in the borough. The mosaic of gardens in the borough provides the space and diversity that organisms need to fulfil their niches. As well as providing a habitat, the mosaic of gardens also assists the movement of species between public green spaces and/or countryside, thus increasing the overall connectivity of the landscape and smoothing the effects of habitat fragmentation. 21.76 The Richmond BAP and other relevant local strategies set out measures to protect and enhance the borough’s biodiversity resource by improving the quality of the local environment through practical management, habitat creation and protection of important wildlife sites and connectivity. The implementation of the Richmond BAP is an important vehicle to improving the biodiversity of the borough. 21.77 Any schemes for incorporating new biodiversity features or creating new habitats should take account of site constraints (such as utility infrastructure) and consider the use of native species. The species suitability and their adaptability to the likely effects of climate change need to be taken into account. Guidance on the use of native species and climate change can be found in the relevant BAP, the Mayor of London's Biodiversity Strategy and the London Tree and Woodland Framework. 21.78 The Council will produce further planning guidance in the form of a SPD on biodiversity, specifically on biodiversity net gain, and set out for applicants and developers how biodiversity net gain can be delivered on a variety of sites, ranging from major to small-scale proposals. Geodiversity 21.79 Geodiversity is concerned with the variety of rocks, fossils, minerals, landforms, soils and natural processes, such as weathering, erosion and sedimentation, that underlie and determine the character of our natural landscape and environment. 21.80 Geodiversity is also a key factor in the borough's cultural identity. The geodiversity of any area is an equally important part of its natural heritage as its biodiversity. Conservation, sustainable management, educational use and interpretation of geodiversity are thus as important as that of biodiversity or archaeology. 21.81 National policy requires sites with geological conservation interests to be protected. 21.82 In line with London Plan Policy G9, there are currently no regionally important geological sites identified in Richmond borough, however Richmond Park is designated as a locally important geological site. 314",

The rivers are important components of the wider Green and Blue Infrastructure network and provide valuable habitats for wildlife including recreational opportunities for local communities. 21.84 The River Thames runs for 34 km through the borough and forms part of the Blue Ribbon Network, which is a network of linked waterways of strategic importance for London. This borough is the only one in London that is intersected by the Thames, therefore benefiting from one of the longest river frontages and associated recreational areas, which gives the borough a unique and historic landscape character. The River Thames connects a variety of landscapes and townscapes, including open stretches of woodland, parks and open spaces, wildlife habitats, important heritage assets as well as industrial and urban waterfronts. 21.85 The borough's Blue Ribbon network contains the River Thames, and other important rivers and waterbodies including the River Crane, Duke of Northumberland River, Longford River and Beverley Brook. These are also identified as green grid areas in the Mayor of London’s All London Green Grid SPG, highlighting the diversity of the borough’s green and blue landscapes and environments. 21.86 The network of linked waterways across the borough and beyond are multifunctional assets.They provide transport and recreation corridors; green infrastructure; a series of diverse and important habitats; a unique backdrop for important heritage assets, including World Heritage Sites, landscapes, views, cultural and community activities; as well as drainage, flood and water management and urban cooling functions. As such, the rivers provide environmental, economic, health and wellbeing benefits for communities and contribute to the special and distinctive character of the borough. 21.87 The Tidal Thames within the London Borough of Richmond is within the Southeast Inshore Marine Plan area. There is an overlap between marine and terrestrial planning. A plan for this area has been prepared by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) and all authorisation or enforcement decisions must be made in accordance with the Marine Plan for any planning activity below mean high water springs, including sections of a tidal river. Early consultation with the MMO is advised. 21.88 The River Crane is an important river corridor, running for 30 kilometres from Harrow through Twickenham and St Margarets to the Thames at Isleworth, which has benefited from significant environmental improvements. Where appropriate, developments alongside and adjacent to the River Crane should contribute to the overarching aim of creating a metropolitan park that provides a continuous, accessible link between Hounslow Heath and the River Thames, 316",

The Council, in conjunction with the Environment Agency, will require a buffer zone of 8 metres on the borough's rivers (including the fluvial Thames and culverted main rivers) and 16 metres for the tidal Thames. This will not only allow for the maintenance and future upgrading of the flood defences, but provide opportunities to enhance biodiversity, create buffer zones that support the green infrastructure network and reduce light spill into the river (also see Policy 43 'Floodlighting and Other External Artificial Lighting '), as well as increase and open up public access alongside and to the river. 21.90 Where barriers to fish movement (such as weirs) are present in a watercourse adjacent to or within a development, the applicant is encouraged to propose a design to include the removal of that barrier, or where not feasible, incorporate measures to allow for the natural movement of fish within the watercourse. Thames Policy Area 21.91 Development proposals within the Thames Policy Area, where appropriate, should ensure that their use and design establish a positive relationship with the river. Account should be taken of the special and varied characters of the River Thames as set out in detail in the Thames Landscape Strategy (from Hampton to Kew) and the Thames Strategy (from Kew to Chelsea) as well as the Council's Conservation Area Appraisals. 21.92 Developments alongside and adjacent to the River Thames should: protect, and where appropriate enhance, the individuality and character of the reach; establish a relationship with the river and address the river as a frontage; open up views and vistas to allow the public to appreciate the riverside setting; protect and, where opportunities arise, enhance existing access points, including river-dependent structures such as bridges, jetties, piers and slipways; allow for public access for pedestrians and cyclists, and where appropriate boats, to enable local communities to gain access to the river and enjoy the riverside; ensure appropriate land uses enable the public to enjoy the riverside setting, especially at ground level in buildings fronting the river where possible. Public access 21.93 There is public access to much of the riverbank in the borough either by towpath or riverside open spaces. New developments adjacent to and alongside the borough's rivers should provide public access to the river, riverside and the foreshore where feasible and appropriate.The Council will require new developments adjacent to the river to consider the need to provide appropriate drowning prevention measures, such as edge protection, appropriate signage and CCTV. Existing public access to the borough's rivers should be retained and opportunities should be taken to improve and enhance access arrangements, including creating inclusive access, where possible.The Council will also explore opportunities to improve accessibility between different areas of the borough that are separated by the borough’s rivers, such as between Ham and Twickenham (see the Place-based strategy for Ham, Petersham & Richmond Park as well as for Twickenham, Strawberry Hill and St Margarets, which refer to the initial feasibility for a new pedestrian and cycle bridge). 21.94 There are parts of the borough where public access to the rivers, including the River Thames, is limited, such as from Kingston Bridge to Twickenham.

The Council has secured the opportunity to provide considerable sections of public riverside walk by requiring a public path to be provided wherever a development adjoins the River Thames. Therefore, all developments adjacent to the River Thames are required to contribute to the public riverside walk along the River Thames, even if there is currently no public access to the route on either side of the development site.The Council expects developers, particularly on major development sites, to work with adjoining landowners where land ownership issues may prevent the aim of achieving public access; this is to ensure the river and the riverside can be enjoyed by the wider public and local community. 21.95 The river corridors, including their associated parks and open spaces, provide important opportunities for recreation and healthy lifestyles. Therefore, all major development proposals adjacent to the borough's rivers should provide through-site links to the riverside to enable the public access to the riverside environment. 21.96 The Council will support initiatives to de-culvert rivers where it is feasible and practicable to do so, in line with the Council’s Surface Water Management Plan. 21.97 Public access to, and alongside, the rivers, for pedestrians, cyclists and boats where appropriate, will be secured through Planning Obligations. Riverside uses, including river-dependent and river-related uses 21.98 River-dependent uses are those whose primary purpose is dependent on the river for siting and function. They are defined as an activity which can only be conducted on, in, over or adjacent to the river because the activity requires direct access to the river and which involves, as an integral part of the activity, the use of the water. River-dependent structures which may in exceptional circumstances be permitted to encroach into the river and its foreshore include tunnels, bridges, jetties, piers, and slipways. 21.99 River-dependent facilities, such as boatyards and sheds, public and private wharves, slipways, wet and dry docks and cranes, as well as piers, pontoons, jetties and stairs are essential for the survival of the river related industry and to support the continued active use of the river. Therefore, they will be protected so that they are not lost to other uses. The Council supports in principle the safeguarding of the sites identified in The Mayor’s Assessment of Boatyard Facilities on the River Thames (2007) and the network of Safeguarded Wharves. 21.100 River-related industrial and business uses, especially those supporting river-dependent uses involving the construction, repair, sale and servicing of river craft, make a vital contribution to the continuation of the historic tradition and function of the River Thames for transportation, communication and recreation and they also play a role in the local economy. This also includes uses and structures that support water-based passenger, tourism and freight transport as well as water-based sport and leisure activities, including visitor and pleasure craft moorings. There should be a move to reducing carbon emissions and the environmental impact, for example away from diesel engines. River-related uses may also include a garden or park specifically designed to enhance public appreciation and public access to the river. 21.101 The Council will therefore protect the existing river-related industrial and business uses and ensure they are not lost to other uses. In addition to their functional roles, river-related uses make an irreplaceable contribution to the character and contrasts of the individual reaches through the activity, distinctive building forms, varied visual interest and historical link they provide. The redevelopment of existing river-related industrial and business sites to residential and non river-related business uses will not be permitted unless it can be demonstrated that such uses are not viable or feasible.This must include evidence of completion of a full and proper marketing exercise of the site at realistic prices both for river-dependent and 318",

Whilst it is acknowledged that existing houseboats, moorings and other floating structures are an established part of the river scene, houseboats, by definition, are an inappropriate use within Metropolitan Open Land. They can cause problems because of infrastructure provision (such as sewage, waste, water, secure storage and washing), provision of access, servicing and car parking, obstruction to navigation and public access to the river, interference with the recreational use of the river and its foreshores and impacts on the views, local character and amenity of the river.Therefore, new proposals for houseboats, including extensions to existing houseboats and other moorings or floating structures designed for permanent residential uses will be resisted. 21.103 Whilst the Council has limited powers regarding the appearance of boats not subject to planning controls, planning permission is required for new moorings and change of use of the river bank and river bed for permanent mooring. Permanently moored vessels and development into waterways should only be permitted for water-related uses. The River Thames should not be used as an extension of developable land in London, nor should parts be a continuous line of moored craft. Proposals for development into waterways will protect at a minimum, and where appropriate enhance, the biodiversity of the river. 21.104 It should be noted that the Council introduced a Moorings Bylaw in 2015. As such, a criminal offence will be committed if any vessel is moored for longer than permitted without the written consent of the Council. The Environment Agency and the Port of London Authority require houseboats to be licensed and can object to them on navigational grounds. The Environment Agency is also able to object to houseboats on flood risk and biodiversity grounds. 319",

Trees as well as other significant vegetation and landscape are key components of the borough's ecological and green infrastructure network. They soften the hardness of buildings and streets, add life, colour and character to the urban landscape and enhance open spaces and the riverside. Trees and other planting, including contiguous gardens and green oases, deliver multiple benefits. They provide an important habitat for wildlife; help improve urban air quality by reducing levels of carbon dioxide and airborne pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and harmful particulates (such as PM10's and PM2.5's); dampen noise from traffic and congestion; increase the supply of oxygen, provide shade for streets, open areas and parks as well as for buildings. They play an important part in supporting biodiversity by providing wildlife habitats and help deliver net gains for biodiversity by helping to restore, strengthen and create landscape-scale green infrastructure networks and help establish coherent ecological networks (strengthening wildlife and ecological corridors). 21.106 Trees and other landscape features can help areas to adapt to the effects of climate change, particularly due to their ability to capture and store atmospheric carbon dioxide, providing a cooling effect and contributing to the reduction of urban heat islands through shade cover and regulating local temperature extremes; this is important due to projected future increases in temperature as a result of climate change with more frequent and more pro-longed summer heatwaves and higher summer temperatures. In addition, they can assist in reducing surface water run off rates and flash floods during heavy rainfall events through absorption and infiltration. 21.107 The London Plan sets out the Mayor’s ambition to increase tree canopy in London by 10% by 2050. The Council’s Climate Emergency Strategy and Action Plan commit to increasing tree cover in the borough. Following an extensive survey of trees across the borough on highways, cemeteries, parks and open spaces and property owned by the Council, a programme of extensive planting is being undertaken, including replanting at sites where trees have been removed and where tree planting could mitigate the effects of climate change. There is further work planned to undertake a boroughwide tree assessment, and opportunities for tree planting in strategic locations; this includes identifying veteran and heritage trees that can be celebrated through the creation of educational material and walks. 21.108 Many trees in the borough are already protected by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) or as a result of their location in Conservation Areas.The Council will consider making further TPOs where trees have been assessed to be of value to the townscape and amenity and which are threatened by development. 21.109 Existing trees, shrubs, and other important vegetation such as hedgerows contribute significantly to the Council’s wider biodiversity and their protection and enhancement will be important to achieve the Council’s policy to provide a net-gain in biodiversity. In line with these objectives, development proposals are required to retain and protect existing trees, and minimise any impacts on trees, shrubs and other significant vegetation such as 321",

Developer contributions towards trees within the public realm may be required where appropriate (see the Council's Planning Obligations SPD). 21.110 In accordance with the overarching adopted London Plan Policy G7 (Trees and woodlands), the planting of trees and new urban woodlands in strategic locations within the borough to help deliver landscape-scale green infrastructure enhancements and contributing to an increase in London’s canopy cover will be encouraged, prioritising the use of native tree species. Tree planting should be considered from the design stage of a proposal. The location of new trees should be planned to complement proposed features, have an appropriately sized tree pit and soil volume, be bio-secure so that species are protected from exposure to new pests and diseases, and be appropriate for the intended use, of the development. The Council will request details relating to the planned maintenance for new trees and landscaping on development sites, to ensure planting becomes established, particularly within the first five years, and will support mature specimens. Planning conditions will also be used, as appropriate. 21.111 It is important that species are chosen that are appropriate to the scale of their surroundings and public amenity, and guidance should be sought from relevant experts. The Council encourages the use of appropriate native species where appropriate. However, it is acknowledged that native species may not always be the most suitable choice, such as in certain historic landscapes, where there is an existing positive character of distinctive non-native trees. Various species of tree within the borough are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change: this was evidenced in 2018 where a long, hot summer resulted in high mortality rates of trees both native and non-native, including Rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) and the common horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum). There may also be other particular situations where the use of non-native species may be beneficial. In addition, the Council encourages schemes that include large trees, where appropriate, as evidence suggests that the larger the tree, the greater the benefits to addressing the effects of climate change, improving air quality, amenity and ecosystems. 21.112 An appropriate replacement for any tree that is felled will be required on-site where practicable. Where this is not possible, the Council will require a financial contribution to provide an off-site street tree. The Council will use the methodology set out in 'Capital Asset Value for Amenity Trees' (CAVAT) for calculating the monetary value and/or compensation where a tree is felled or damaged. Where a tree has been removed, the location will be reserved for a replacement tree, the Council will not agree to the construction of a vehicular cross over or drop kerb in its place. The Council will encourage, where practical, that replacement trees result in a net increase in tree canopy cover. 21.113 The term 'landscape' is taken to refer to the design of all space between buildings and includes walls and boundaries, paving as well as planting. It refers to both 'soft' as well as 'hard' landscape and materials. These considerations are often vital in creating an appropriate setting to new developments and in integrating new development to its surroundings. Landscape design must form an integral part of any proposal and needs to be considered in relation to the development as a whole at the start of a project. Landscape design and where appropriate tree planting as well as other green infrastructure elements such as green roofs and green walls, will also need to contribute to and complement the existing character of an area. Guidance on the retention and planting of trees in new development can be found in the report Residential Development and Trees published by the Woodland Trust. 21.114 The Council plans to publish guidance in the form of a SPD on Trees, which will include guidance on planting. This is intended to provide further details on the information required at pre-application and application stage, as well as around management, maintenance and monitoring.

The London Plan focuses on a design-led approach to deliver beautiful buildings and high-quality places. 22.3 Through development and change, there is an opportunity to enhance the character of an area to benefit existing communities and future residents and visitors. The borough includes numerous parks, Conservation Areas, listed buildings, well utilised open spaces, and is the only London Borough to 22.6 lie on both sides of the River Thames. Development will need to recognise the unique circumstances in our borough and it is important that proposals demonstrate how a character-led approach to any proposal, including intensification, has been taken. 22.4 In the London Plan, Policy D3 sets out the details of the design-led approach for development proposals to follow, and Policy D4 details the process and actions that will help ensure development delivers good design whilst also ensuring the most efficient use of land so that development on sites is optimised. The optimum capacity for a site does not mean the maximum capacity. A design-led approach places an emphasis on ensuring developments are sensitive to the existing character, by incorporating positive 22.7 attributes of an area as well as helping establish character or removing negative attributes (such as unsympathetic building 326 extensions and alterations that undermine the consistency and quality of the townscape). The Urban Design Study provides an analysis of character, capacity for growth and what elements of design could be improved across the borough, along with specific design guidance for each character area. Design and Access Statements should set out the consideration of design options, using the principles of the ten characteristics of well-designed place as set out in the National Design Guide; this should be proportionate to the scale and type of development, although the principles can be applied to larger schemes as well as the detailed design of a small space. It is important that design quality is maintained throughout the whole process by providing the detailed design of a development early in the planning process and ensuring it is delivered. Landscaping details often constitute the key elements of design via the creation of a desirable environment and improving the public realm, which are instrumental to the subsequent quality of a place. The Council will therefore seek detailed elements such as landscaping upfront, rather than securing relying on planning conditions, to allow for a proper assessment as part of the planning process. This would also ensure there is permeable surfacing and space to accommodate trees and allow for them to reach maturity and improve visual amenity and biodiversity. The London Plan recognises the importance that 3D virtual reality tools and other interactive digital models have in helping understand the options and opportunities for particular sites.

The Council particularly encourages developers to engage with less frequently heard communities and residents who are typically underrepresented in the planning process. Local interest groups could include, but not exclusively, schools and higher education facilities, local businesses, amenity groups, faith groups, sports organisations, voluntary organisations, charities and outreach organisations. 22.9 Engagement should commence in early development stages and continue throughout the duration of the design and development process. It should not be a ‘tick box’ exercise for minor elements of the development, but should seek to empower communities by working with them to shape their environment and unlock their knowledge of a place. 22.10 Meaningful engagement results in mutual positive outcomes for the applicant and local community. Adverse impacts on the community and local area can be identified early on and appropriately mitigated, resulting in fewer delays at planning application stage; public benefits from a scheme can also be better tailored for improved outcomes for the community, which can result in greater public ‘buy-in’ to a development scheme. These measures if meaningful should result in less opposition to a proposal when planning permission is sought. 22.11 The submission of a Community Engagement Statement is required for all major applications at validation stage; all other applicants are strongly encouraged to engage with the local community prior to the submission of an application and all applicants are advised to consult the Council’s Statement of Community Involvement. The Council is also producing further guidance, ‘Raising the Bar’, to aid developers with their consultation. The Council recognises that the level of community engagement should be proportionate to the scale of development. 22.12 Pre-application discussions are an important tool for achieving the best outcome on a site and ensuring that wider place-making objectives are met.The Council promotes the use of planning performance agreements (PPAs) to provide a framework for handling a development proposal from pre-application stage through to decision, including a target committee date, expectations and programme of meetings. The approach should be proportionate to the nature and scale of a proposed development and complexity of the issues to be addressed. 22.13 The Richmond Design Review Panel (RDRP) has been set up with the aim of raising the standard of design quality in the borough. It is an independent multi-disciplinary body whose members are skilled in architecture, planning, landscape architecture, urban design, engineering, transport planning and heritage conservation. For each design review, the Panel is based on the expertise and specialist skills required for the project(s) being reviewed. The Terms of Reference on the Council’s website set out the current thresholds for types of proposals triggering a design review, as well as details of the types of reviews and fees. 22.14 Since the publication of the National Design Guide, and the subsequent publication of the National Model Design Code, there is increased emphasis on the use of Design Codes. Design coding is one tool available to local planning authorities, communities and developers to define and deliver good design and ensure design quality is upheld throughout the planning process. Design Codes are expected to form a role in the Government’s proposed future reforms of the plan-making system and should be developed collaboratively with stakeholders and the community as appropriate. A Design Code is a set of simple, concise, illustrated design requirements that are visual and numerical wherever possible to provide specific, detailed parameters for the physical development of a site or area.

Height is only one element of a number of factors when considering a development’s acceptability and whether it is of good design. Nevertheless, height is a significant factor in terms of increasing the visibility of a development and its potential wider impact on an area’s character. 22.17 The text box above sets out the borough’s local definition of a tall building.This definition has been developed in response to the low-rise building heights, character and sensitivities within the borough. The use of a single definition of a tall building provides an approach which is simple and easy to understand for residents and developers, and which adds certainty to the implementation of the policy. 22.18 The definition will be applied in the context of Policy D9 of the London Plan, which states that local definitions of a tall building should not be less than 6 storeys or 18 metres measured from ground to the floor level of the storey (i.e. excludes the height of the uppermost storey). For clarity, buildings will be considered tall where they meet the definitions set out above and in Part A of Policy D9 of the London Plan. 22.19 Ground level is defined as the surface of the ground immediately adjacent to the building in question and does not include any additions laid on top of the ground (such as decking).Where the site is not flat, the ground level will be considered as the highest part of the surface which adjoins the building. Definition of the top of the building does not include typical structures and plant found at roof level, such as railings, plant equipment, maintenance cranes or elevator shafts; however, the placement, scale and design of 330",

The definition for a tall or mid-rise building applies to whichever is the lower between the number of the storeys and the metres above ground level. Where applications involve the addition of storeys on a building that would already be classed as ‘tall’, or the additional storeys would cause the building to be considered 'tall' in accordance with the definition above, an assessment against the criteria of this policy will be carried out. 22.21 The Urban Design Study draws on development capacity, existing tall buildings and consented tall buildings mapping to help inform an overall strategy for potential development and/or increased height across the borough. The Study sets out a strategy for mid-rise and tall building development (see the overall development strategy Map 1 in Section 5 of this Plan) and from this identifies Tall and Mid-Rise Building Zones (see Appendix 3 for zone details). 22.22 Tall buildings will only be an acceptable form of development in Tall Building Zones identified on tall building maps in Appendix 3. The designation of an area as a Tall Building Zone does not mean the area has capacity to receive tall buildings within the appropriate range across its whole extent. Development proposals will need to consider the specific context of the plot, existing buildings surrounding the plot and any other development proposals in the area, including consented schemes. This designation also does not preclude other forms of development. Locations identified as Tall Building Zones can also accommodate high density mid-rise or mansion-block style development, rather than only standalone high-rise towers. Outside Tall Building Zones, there is no presumption in support of tall buildings. 22.23 The identified Tall Building Zones seek to strike a careful balance between maximising the development potential of key areas of growth and protecting the significance of valued historical assets including listed buildings and Conservation Areas (see Policy 29 'Designated Heritage Assets ' for the details of designated heritage assets). The existence of already built tall buildings where their heights and location are deemed to be inappropriate, has not been considered as a sufficient justification for the creation of further Tall Building Zones. The townscape of our borough is not generally appropriate for locating clusters of tall buildings. As such, clustering is discouraged. 22.24 Tall building maps in Appendix 3 identify an appropriate tall building height range for each zone and show how heights should be dispersed across the zone. Darker colours indicate more potential for height and the lighter colours indicate less potential for height. The maps make it clear that the identified maximum appropriate height does not apply to the entire zone; buildings will be expected to step down towards the edges of the zone as indicated on the gradient tall buildings map unless it can be demonstrated that this would not be appropriate in the local context. The appropriate height ranges have been informed by a visual impact analysis, taking into account heritage asset settings, views and, where relevant, existing guidance on cluster formation and 3D modelling. Development proposals exceeding the appropriate height will not be supported on design grounds. 22.25 Tall building development must be of such a design quality that it enhances the character of the place within which it is set. London Plan Policy D9 sets out detailed requirements and criteria against which tall building proposals will be assessed.These include consideration of the visual, functional, environmental and cumulative impacts of development. The criteria outlined in the London Plan are complemented by detailed criteria that responds to the local context in this Plan.This policy and London Plan Policy D9 should be read in conjunction with other Local Plan policies, including Policy 28 'Local Character and Design Quality (Strategic Policy)' which sets the requirements for delivering high quality, design-led development across the borough.

Other relevant considerations are provided in Historic England’s Advice Note 4 on Tall Buildings 2015. 22.26 Richmond has the longest frontage to the River Thames of all the London boroughs. While the scale of the river presents opportunities for height, any tall structure will still have a major influence due to the long sweeping panoramic views across and along the banks, which extend well beyond the borough and can be prominent and highly visible from several places. Any tall or mid-rise development alongside the River Thames will need to ensure that the river front will not feel private, heavily overlooked or shaded, as detailed in Policy 40 'Rivers and River Corridors '. Moreover, the building design will need to consider its role as an important marker for legibility/identity of the borough and wayfinding, owing to its high visibility along the riverfront. In particular, riverside development viewed from bridges are one of the ways that the greatest number of people experience the borough. Development in areas of larger-scale riverfront buildings, such as Mortlake, should consider their landward facing orientation and step down appropriately to provide a transition towards the typical period terraces and modest housing scale. Materials may also be used to transition from the river frontage, where views are cherished, towards the more traditional natural materials of housing stock within the borough. 22.27 The above text box sets out the borough’s definition of a mid-rise building. This additional designation provides a greater degree of control over buildings which seem tall in relation to the proportions of the surrounding townscape context, yet not sufficiently tall to be considered a tall building in line with the London Plan definition. The majority of buildings in the borough are typically 2-3 storeys, as such mid-rise buildings of 5 storeys or more would be substantially taller than their surroundings. Mid-rise building maps contained in Appendix 3 shows that opportunities for mid-rise buildings are generally concentrated within four different types of areas: 1. transition areas to Tall Building Zones; 2. along strategic road corridors; 3. within town centres; and 4. within or adjacent to areas which include buildings taller than the prevailing height or subject to substantial redevelopment. 22.28 Mid-rise buildings will be supported in Tall and Mid-Rise Building Zones identified in Appendix 3, subject to addressing criteria in Part C of the policy. Proposals for mid-rise buildings should not exceed the identified appropriate heights for each Mid-Rise Zone. 22.29 Proposals for mid-rise buildings may be considered suitable outside Tall and Mid-Rise Building Zones as per Part D of the policy and subject to addressing criteria in Part C. The Urban Design Study, which provides the basis of the locations of the Tall and Mid-Rise Zones, is a snapshot in time with regards to the character of the borough and the sensitivity and probability for change, as well as known sites that may become available for development. 22.30 Given the historic nature of the borough and presence of protected views, there is confidence that all potential sites for tall buildings have been identified through the Urban Design Study. There may, however, be further suitable sites for mid-rise buildings which become available later in the plan period which are not currently known. For example, land assembly could enable the creation of a larger site which allows for a comprehensive scheme with mid-rise at its centre while still integrating well with the locality, with lower height at the periphery to avoid imposing negatively on the surroundings. As such, proposals for mid-rise buildings may be appropriate outside of the defined zones, when a certain set of criteria is met (as listed in part D). 22.31 Applicants will be required to submit technical supporting information and graphic 3D modelling (e.g. enabled by VU.City), as defined within the LBRuT local validation checklist for all tall buildings applications. Through the design-led process all proposals for tall buildings will need to provide a sufficient level of information to demonstrate that potential impacts have been suitably identified and adequately addressed.

However, regard must also be had, as part of the assessment of a planning application, to the Council’s duty to maintain, and where appropriate, enhance the character, appearance and distinctiveness of the borough, particularly of Conservation Areas. It is the overall design, taking all factors into account including the area’s character, that will be the determinant of whether a proposal has a reasonable impact on amenity and living conditions. Daylight, sunlight and solar glare 22.37 In assessing whether sunlight and daylight conditions are acceptable, the Council will have regard to the most recent Building Research Establishment (BRE) guidance, taking into account context and other material considerations. Assessment will apply for new development, and for properties affected by new development, to include inside buildings, gardens and open spaces. 22.38 Solar glare principally occurs when the sun is low in the sky and dazzles the eye either directly or indirectly via a reflected surface. Glare or dazzle can occur when sunlight is reflected from a glazed façade or area of metal cladding. This can affect road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists and drivers, and the occupants of adjoining buildings. The potential impact of glare or dazzle will need to be carefully considered and assessed where relevant to ensure there are no adverse impacts. Visual intrusion, privacy and outlook 22.39 An overbearing, overpowering or over-dominant development can significantly reduce the quality of living conditions both inside and outside, in new as well as existing developments. The degree of overlooking depends on the distance and the horizontal and vertical angles of view. The impact on the sense of enclosure will often be dependent on an on-site judgement. 22.40 The policy seeks to strike a balance between how developments are designed to enable a sense of community as well as offering people enough privacy in their homes.Whilst there will be some impact from any new development, the test is degree of harm in relation to the impact on habitable rooms, which includes all separate living rooms and bedrooms, plus kitchens with a floor area of 13sqm or more. Development should have regard to the Mayor’s Housing Design Standards London Plan Guidance (consultation draft February 2022), which provides guidance on aspect, orientation, daylight and sunlight, including that the main living and eating spaces enjoy reasonable privacy. 22.41 For developments in Richmond, a minimum distance guideline of 20 metres between habitable rooms within existing residential development is usually viewed as appropriate for privacy reasons; a greater distance may be required for other reasons, or a lesser distance may be acceptable in some circumstances. These numerical guidelines should be assessed on a case by case basis, since privacy is only one of many factors in site layout design; the established pattern of development in the area (layout and height) may justify lesser distances. The distance of 20 metres is generally accepted as the distance that will not result in unreasonable overlooking. Where principal windows face a wall that contains no windows or those that are occluded (e.g. bathrooms), separation distances can be reduced to 13.5 metres. 22.42 So as not to unnecessarily restrict density on certain sites, when designing buildings with regards to its impact on other buildings within the same development, additional measures can be applied to minimise overlooking, such as splays, angles of buildings, obscure glazing etc. The internal layout of buildings can also be coordinated so that residual overlooking is only between rooms of the same type and sensitivity (i.e. living rooms facing living rooms, and bedrooms facing 336",

A Supporting Planning Statement should set out justification for reduced distances. 22.43 Privacy of gardens and courtyards is also important. However, public spaces and communal amenity areas will benefit from a degree of overlooking due to the increased level of surveillance it can provide. 22.44 Balconies or terraces on roofs of main buildings can be visually intrusive and result in serious intrusion into the privacy and quiet enjoyment of neighbouring residential properties. 22.45 Outlook is the visual amenity enjoyed by occupants when looking out of their windows or from their garden; how pleasant an outlook is depends on what is being viewed. Loss of daylight/sunlight (based on BRE guidance), overshadowing and loss of outlook to the detriment of residential amenity are material planning considerations; however, the loss of a private view from a property is not a material planning consideration. 22.46 The Council's SPDs, including on Householder Extensions and External Alterations, Residential Development Standards, Small and Medium Housing Sites (and any future updates to these SPDs) and the Urban Design Study, provide further guidance and illustrations on how to assess sunlight/daylight, overshadowing, visual intrusion, privacy and space between buildings.

Ensuring that walking, cycling and public transport are the natural choice for trips to and from new developments is vital if these goals are to be achieved. The policies on Sustainable Travel Choices and Parking in the Local Plan should be read alongside those in the London Plan and the Mayor of London’s Transport Strategy. 23.2 The Council has a Local Implementation Plan (LIP 3) adopted in 2019 detailing its vision for how the transport network will be transformed over the next 20 years. It includes a headline target for 75% of trips to be by sustainable modes (walking, cycling and public transport) by 2041, from a baseline of 61%. The plan also includes targets for expanding the cycle network, improving air quality, reducing road danger and increasing the use of public transport. Planning applicants proposing major developments will need to demonstrate how their proposals help meet these targets. 23.3 The Richmond Active Travel Strategy 2020 has been developed to provide detail on how the Council will support the objectives in the Local Implementation Plan, focusing on walking and cycling. The Local Plan policies seek to prioritise facilities for sustainable travel modes and promotes a Healthy Streets Approach in developments, as set out in Policy 1 'Living Locally and the 20-minute neighbourhood (Strategic Policy)' and in accordance with the London Plan policy T2. Location of development 23.4 Developments that will generate a large volume of trips should be focused in areas with high Public Transport Accessibility Levels (PTALs) to help create the most sustainable transport environment. PTAL takes account of the accessibility of a location to public transport, in six broad bands, with level 6 being the most accessible. Whilst in general higher PTALs are achieved in areas with good rail/tube connections, in this borough it is recognised that bus links also contribute to levels of accessibility to public transport. Future improvements to accessibility will also be relevant. These include planned changes by Transport for London (TfL), the Council, rail or bus companies or improvements which could be either provided as part of a new development or funded by developer contributions. To be taken into account there will need to be certainty that future improvements will be implemented in time to serve the development and would be sustainable in the longer-term. 23.5 High trip generating development includes larger offices, shopping and leisure facilities as well as mixed use and higher density residential schemes, where a large number of trips are generated each day. As a starting point, areas with a PTAL score of 4-6 are considered to be appropriate locations for high trip generating development. 23.6 The Council will use a site’s current PTAL as a starting point, but also consider the highway capacity, the proximity of cycle and walking routes as well as future improvements when evaluating development proposals. 340",

          "content": "Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) - June 2023 Active travel 23.7 The Healthy Streets Approach underpins the Mayor’s Transport Strategy and seeks to encourage more Londoners to use active travel by improving the quality and experience of being on our streets. The approach puts people, and their health, at the heart of decision-making, resulting in a healthier and more inclusive city where people choose to walk, cycle and use public transport. Policies and strategies are expected to focus on creating streets that are pleasant, safe and attractive, where noise, air pollution, accessibility and lack of seating and shelter are not barriers to prevent people – particularly the most vulnerable people – from getting out and about. These objectives are interlinked with this Local Plan’s priorities around living locally and minimising greenhouse gas emissions. 23.8 The Council’s Active Travel Strategy aims to increase the number of trips in the borough taken by walking and cycling, as both standalone trips and as part of longer trips involving public transport. Objectives include: to support local walking and cycling trips using the Healthy Streets Approach; create a high-quality core cycle network connecting popular destinations; make improvements to clean-air walking and cycling routes away from roads; and improve awareness of local walking, cycling and running routes. 23.9 Developments should encourage the use of modes other than the car by making it as easy as possible through provision of good pedestrian facilities, clear layout and signage, provision of cycling facilities and improving access to public transport interchanges. Civic spaces and public realm should be accessible and inclusive. A good walking environment has been shown to be not only beneficial to an individual’s health and social life, but also to bring economic benefits to the borough’s centres. 23.10 Cycling and walking contributes significantly towards creating an attractive and pleasant environment. New development should include all the facilities needed to encourage a safe walking and cycling environment from first occupation. Cycle parking should, at least, be provided in accordance with the minimum standards in the London Plan. 23.11 Developments should be integrated into the surrounding community and existing local routes and provide for improvements to accessibility for all.There are many footpaths, Public Rights of Way and cycle routes in the borough that new development should not compromise, and opportunities to improve them should be taken wherever possible. For this reason, in line with Policy 28 'Local Character and Design Quality (Strategic Policy)', gated developments will not be permitted. 23.12 The Council promotes the creation of a safe network for pedestrians and cyclists. Management of other users including speed restrictions, sufficient widths, segregation where appropriate, introducing traffic calming measures where needed, and well designed and positioned crossing facilities can reduce conflict between users.Well-designed paths, natural surveillance, appropriate levels of lighting and other security measures and good levels of maintenance can improve actual and perceived security. The Council's Public Space Design Guide includes advice with respect to the amenity of the pedestrian environment. The London Cycling Design Standards sets out requirements and advice for cycle network planning and for the design of dedicated cycle infrastructure, cycle-friendly streets and cycle parking 23.13 The Council will ensure that there is signage and way marking of the three strategic walking routes identified in the London Plan, and of the main cycle routes (see The Council’s Active Travel Strategy),which run through the borough – the Thames Path National Trail, the Capital Ring and the London Loop, and other promoted route, such as the River Crane Walk and Beverley Brook Walk, which together form a network of leisure routes which most residents can reach 23.14 Proposals that improve transport links within or between the borough and other areas will be encouraged. This could refer to physical proposals and improvements such as a new bridge or path; improving existing links such as creating a new gate into a park; or 341",

Reference should be made to the priorities identified in the Local Implementation Plan. Inclusive mobility 23.15 New development must be accessible and inclusive for a range of users, including disabled people and people with long-term health conditions, by adopting an inclusive design approach.This includes the approach to parking, a wholistic approach to streets, and wider way-finding and legibility. For technical guidance on this subject, applicants are advised to use the latest guidance on Inclusive Mobility. Applicants should also seek advice from Borough Engineers on this subject if they intend to carry out new works on the highway. Assessing the impact of developments 23.16 All planning applications will be required to demonstrate that their proposed developments do not a have a severe impact on the operation, safety, or accessibility of the local or strategic road network. The method of assessment required will depend on the use(s) being proposed and its size, in accordance with the thresholds in Table 23.1. The assessment requirements for some uses now falling within Class E of the Use Classes Order will need to be considered on a case-by-case basis if the particular Class E use is not specified in Table 23.1 (‘Other uses falling in Class E’). Where necessary and justified, the Council will use conditions and/or planning obligations to limit uses consented within Class E in order to achieve the objectives of this policy and in line with the NPPF and accompanying PPG to assess the significant impacts from the development on the transport network or on highway safety, and to mitigate the impacts of development given the range of uses that need to be fully assessed. Matters to be included in Transport Assessments and Transport Statements are set out in the London Plan, the latest Department for Transport as well as Transport for London guidance, and the Council’s Local Validation Checklist and Transport SPD. 23.17 Planning applicants are strongly advised to seek pre-application planning advice regarding the parameters of any assessment of the transport impacts of their development proposals. For major development proposals, they are also advised to seek pre-application transport advice from Transport for London (TfL) Officers as well as Borough Officers. 23.18 In instances where the applicant is required to assess the transport impacts of their development as part of their design and access statement (see Table 23.1 above) they will need to include: 1. A description of the development proposals 2. A description of the local highway and passenger transport network 3. Trip generation details, using TRICS for residential developments of 10 dwellings or more, or for other land uses that are at or above the threshold at which a transport statement and travel plan statement is required (see Table 23.1). 4. A vehicular parking stress survey if the required off-street vehicular parking standard cannot be met (see Policy 48 'Vehicular Parking Standards, Cycle Parking, Servicing and Construction Logistics Management') 5. Details of how the proposed development will be serviced 6. Details of off-street car and cycle parking (see Policy 48 'Vehicular Parking Standards, Cycle Parking, Servicing and Construction Logistics Management') 7. Details of how any significant impacts will be mitigated, including on-street vehicular parking. 23.19 Developments will be expected to continue travel planning after occupation to maximise travel by sustainable transport, including personalised travel planning. Existing schools and large employers will also be encouraged to produce travel plans for their sites to help encourage sustainable travel.

By reducing demand for other forms of surface transport, particularly on roads, the benefits of low carbon emissions water transport link through to other key aspects of this Plan, such as reducing traffic and congestion, improving the local environment and quality of life. Together with other policies in this Plan, including Policy 34 'Green and Blue Infrastructure (Strategic Policy) ', Policy 40 'Rivers and River Corridors 'and Policy 41 'Moorings and Floating Structures', this policy supports the multi-functional use of the Blue Ribbon Network. Safeguarding routes and facilities 23.21 The need to ensure the provision of sufficient and suitably-located land for the development of the current and expanded public and active transport system is identified in the London Plan. The Council will ensure that development proposals safeguard land required for transport schemes and infrastructure unless alternative facilities are satisfactorily provided. The loss of existing bus garages will be resisted, to safeguard capacity for efficient and sustainable operation of the network, unless it is demonstrated, and confirmed by Transport for London, that it is operationally no longer needed or enhanced reprovision has been made as part of the redevelopment of the site or elsewhere in a convenient and accessible alternative location. 23.22 To discourage vehicles having to make longer trips in order to reach refuelling stations, the Council is seeking to protect existing facilities. Any new facilities should be located on strategic or distributor road networks to minimise disruption and to protect residential amenity. The provision of refuelling facilities for alternative types of fuel e.g. electric or hydrogen will also be encouraged 23.23 The need for improved quality and connectivity of transport interchanges to improve movement in Outer London was identified in both the London Plan and by the Outer London Commission. In the local context 'transport interchanges' refers to anywhere where more than one type of transport mode meets, from train and bus stations to bus stops.Transport schemes are set out in the Council's Local Implementation Plan and where appropriate in the site allocations of the Local Plan, and/or in planning briefs. 23.24 Delivery of transport infrastructure, including the relevant proposed transport schemes as set out in the London Plan, is critical to the delivery of the strategic objectives of the Local Plan. Planning, through the use of developers' contributions such as through the use of planning obligations (including Section 106 and Community Infrastructure Levy) is a key way that the Council can gain the necessary resources to assist in the delivery of this vital infrastructure. Taxis and private hire vehicles 23.25 Taxi ranks should be conveniently located close to the venue they serve and accessible for all with adequate space for customers to queue. Taxi ranks should be well-lit and with good CCTV facilities. Ranks must not adversely impact on pedestrian movement or road safety. The Council will consider applications for offices for private hire vehicles against relevant policies of the plan, and subject to them not having an adverse impact on other types of transport including walking and cycling, on-street parking and highway safety or causing disturbance to residents. Transport for London’s Taxi and Private Hire Guidance for Developers (2018) should be referred to when planning for taxi provision. 343",

This has led to high levels of on-street parking, worsened in areas where there is a demand for commuter parking.The approach aims to ensure that sufficient on-site car parking is provided to meet the needs of the occupiers of the new development, but also to ensure that excessive on-street parking demand is not created which could have an adverse impact on local highway/traffic conditions, street scene and impacts on making the best use of land. Vehicle and cycle parking standards 23.27 This policy covers the parking standards for new developments of all types. Parking must be sensitively located and designed and suitably landscaped to minimise visual intrusion and disturbance. To maintain sufficient parking space within new developments, the parking provision will be expected to be legally tied to the development that it serves. 23.28 To mitigate the impact of their proposed development on the level of on-street vehicular parking stress in their local area, planning applicants proposing developments located in an area covered by a controlled parking zone (CPZ), or proposing developments in areas that might be covered by a CPZ in the future pending a review of the area and a statutory consultation process carried out by the Council’s Parking Policy team, may be asked to enter into an S106 legal agreement which will preclude all occupants, with the exception of those holding blue badges for disabled motorists, of that development from purchasing vehicular parking permits within any controlled parking zone (CPZ) or any Council-managed carpark within the Borough of Richmond-Upon-Thames.This will depend on: 1. The size of their development (see Table 23.1 within Policy 47 'Sustainable Travel Choices (Strategic Policy)') 2. The number of off-street vehicular parking spaces proposed, including disabled parking spaces 3. The proposed land uses 4. The level of in or out-commuting by car in the local area 5. The level of household car ownership within the local area 6. The level of on-street vehicular parking stress in that area (see below) 7. The level of existing take-up of CPZ permits within the particular CPZ 23.29 Such restriction would be secured by excluding the address from the schedule of streets in the relevant road traffic order that created or creates the Controlled Parking Zone in which the property is situated, by restricting under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 the disposal of an interest in relevant properties unless a person disposing advises the person acquiring of the non-availability of residents or business on-street parking permits and/or through Section 16 of the Greater London Council (General Powers) Act 1974 (or any statute revoking or re-enacting that Act). 23.30 Depending on the above factors, applicants may be asked to submit an on-street vehicular parking stress survey, completed in accordance with the Council’s guidance. Applicants are strongly advised to seek pre-application transport advice regarding the likelihood of occupants of their development being excluded from any CPZ or the need for a vehicular parking stress survey before they submit any planning application. 23.31 Commercial occupants of any development will be limited to no more than five controlled parking zone permits per business. Applicants proposing Use Class F or Class E(e) or (f) and/or sui generis land uses will be excluded from the CPZ their proposed development is located within.

Where a tree has been removed, the location will be reserved for a replacement tree, the Council will not agree to the construction of a vehicular cross over or drop kerb in its place. See Policy 42 'Trees, Woodland and Landscape' which recognises the value of trees in the borough. Car-free developments 23.34 Car-free developments may be acceptable where they meet the criteria in part C of the policy. Developers should contact the Council’s transport planners at an early stage to discuss parking requirements (transportation@richmond.gov.uk). Developers may be required to undertake local street parking surveys to demonstrate the capacity of the highway to accommodate additional parking demand. Development, particularly larger development, is commonly excluded from eligibility for existing or future street parking permits. Applicants might also be asked to make a financial contribution towards the review of on-street parking in the area in which their proposed development is located, and/or the design or res-design of a CPZ which will mitigate the impact of their development on on-street parking stress. The Provision of Vehicular and/or Cycle Parking Infrastructure on the Highway 23.35 Disabled parking spaces are expected to be provided off-street within developments.This is because household car ownership levels in the Borough are above the London average and, as a result, on-street vehicular parking space is scarce. Also, these spaces may not be able to be reserved for residents of the development. 23.36 Cycle parking facilities on the highway cannot be reserved especially for occupants of for visitors to any development and can be used by any member of the public who wishes to use them. Therefore, all short and long-stay cycle parking is expected to be provided off-street where feasible. 23.37 Where it is not possible to provide off-street short and long stay cycle parking in accordance with the standards set out in part A planning applicants will be expected to contribute towards the cost of installing bicycle hangars or Sheffield stands on the highway where there is local support for the Traffic Management Order required to install them. This will be secured through a S106 legal agreement. Car Club Bay and Membership Provision 23.38 The Council encourages the use of car clubs as an alternative to private car ownership. Car clubs can help reduce levels of household car ownership, the number of journeys taken by car, and the need for off and on-street vehicular parking space. 23.39 Car club spaces should be provided off-street where possible. If this is not possible, the applicant will be expected to pay for the cost of a Traffic Management Order and, if necessary, S278 highway works, to install any car club bays on the highway. 23.40 Car club vehicles should also be available for use by members of the public for the required fee and the operator should be accredited by CoMoUK or otherwise approved by the Council. Freight and servicing 23.41 The majority of the borough’s businesses and other organisations require regular servicing and deliveries to their site(s). However, it must be recognised that whilst these vehicles provide a vital service, they can also be a cause of congestion, safety and environmental concerns if not properly managed through a variety of mechanisms. Such premises often neighbour residential properties and a balance needs to be achieved between enabling businesses to receive the goods and services they need 347",

The provision of adequate community and social 24.3 infrastructure is essential to support the projected population growth within the borough. Such facilities are often at the heart of local communities; they are important for the quality of life of residents, in the creation of more inclusive and sustainable communities and in helping to promote social interaction and encouraging people to lead more healthy and active lives.The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted just how important social and community infrastructure is to the local community. It is important that these facilities and services continue to meet people's needs at all stages of their lives and are accessible to all. 24.2 This policy covers any type of social and community infrastructure floorspace that is 24.4 important to the local community. It encompasses a wide range of services, some of which are statutory services such as health and education and the Council will work with partners to ensure that local communities continue to have access to such services. Others are non-statutory community services such as cultural, play, recreation, sports and 24.5 faith facilities including those for voluntary or charitable purposes. The Council considers it important to protect such uses and facilities as they play a key role in maintaining and fostering community and social cohesion. This approach also reflects London Plan Policy S1. Some examples of social and community infrastructure include public services, GP surgeries, nurseries, community centres, public halls, arts and cultural facilities, policing, fire and ambulance services, youth centres, social clubs, indoor sport and recreation facilities, libraries, laundrettes, places of worship, and public houses. This is not an exhaustive list and the Council will determine whether any facility or service is considered to be a social infrastructure or community use. The pre-application process is encouraged and on specific schemes may clarify which policies and requirements apply. Schools and other education facilities, health and social 350 care facilities as well as leisure and recreation facilities are dealt with in more detail in separate policies within this Plan. Infrastructure provision and needs have been identified with the relevant partner organisations and are set out in the Council's Infrastructure Delivery Plan 2023. There is a need for nursery, education and health provision across the borough. More specific requirements for community facilities may be identified by local communities, such as a Neighbourhood Plan. The London Plan also seeks to conserve cultural infrastructure, as set out in London Plan Policy E10, and the GLA have developed a snapshot mapping the existing cultural infrastructure. The Council will work with partners including public and private infrastructure providers and the community and voluntary sector in ensuring the provision of services. It is recognised that in some instances there may need to be some additional development to support the cost of retaining or reproviding existing social infrastructure uses. Such development may be acceptable provided that the proposal will result in an overall improvement to the existing social and community facilities and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a widespread impact on how services and support are delivered to local people, and over time the infrastructure needed to deliver them may change. However in many areas, it has brought a focus on having local, community hubs, as part of “Living Locally” and adaptable spaces bringing opportunities for interaction. In addition, the Government’s changes to the Use Classes affect social infrastructure and community infrastructure. Class F1 includes learning and non-residential institutions and Class F2 local community uses including halls and community spaces, indoor swimming pools and areas for outdoor sport or recreation. Class E is a wide range of commercial, business and services including gyms, indoor sport, creches, medical and health services. While this Plan supports provision of social and community infrastructure for meeting local needs, the flexibility introduced by Government through Use Class E (commercial, business and",

The policy approach to retaining existing social and community infrastructure and assessing new or improved social and community infrastructure set out above will apply where planning permission is required for a change of use, or to extensions and new 24.8 development.Where necessary and justified, the Council will use conditions and/or planning obligations to limit uses consented within Classes E and F in order to achieve the objectives of this policy and in line with the NPPF and accompanying PPG to ensure provision of social, recreational and cultural facilities and services to meet community needs and to mitigate the impacts of development given the range of uses that need to be fully assessed. New social and community infrastructure 24.6 Provision of good quality social and community infrastructure is critical for social cohesion and contributes to the creation of lifetime neighbourhoods, i.e. places where people are able to live and work in safe, healthy, supportive and inclusive environments with which they are proud to identify.The Council will support the provision of new or extensions to existing social infrastructure where it provides for an identified need. 24.9 24.7 Need is identified on an evidential basis from the Council and its partners strategies and plans, including: 1. The Council's Infrastructure Delivery Plan 2. The Council's Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA) 3. The Council's School Place Planning Strategy and Childcare Sufficiency Assessment 4. The Council's Cultural Partnership Strategy and Culture Richmond 2021-2031 5. Estates Strategies produced by health bodies, such as the NHS England and 351 South West London Integrated Care System 6. Government departments’ Estates Strategies 7. The Metropolitan Police Authority's Estates Strategy 8. Other local evidence such as community needs identified as part of Neighbourhood Plans. Access for all is important including for the young, old and disabled. The appropriate level of accessibility to the public will depend on the nature of the scheme and its catchment. The types of larger facilities in multi-use buildings that will be visited regularly and by a greater number of people should be located in the borough's centres or areas of good public transport accessibility. Smaller facilities serving a more local catchment should be accessible by walking or cycling. The Council will encourage high quality and sustainable design of social infrastructure including measures to improve its actual, and perception of, accessibility. There may be relevant standards for new social and community infrastructure covering regulatory aspects for the specific type of provision, for example for health and care facilities the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC)’s Health Building Notes provide guidance on the design and planning of new healthcare buildings and their immediate environment. Where practicable, social infrastructure and community facilities should be provided in multi-use, flexible and adaptable buildings or co-located with other social infrastructure uses which can increase public access and help to minimise capital or revenue costs to community groups. Multi-use means, for example, that a school uses the school and playing fields during the school day, during term time and the facilities are available for use by the community outside school hours i.e. evenings, weekends and during school holidays. Community use could be individuals, sports and arts clubs, voluntary sector groups or private groups, and can range from informal/occasional bookings through to planned, professional activity. Multi-use already exists in many forms within the borough.The Council will encourage and",

The combined impact of multi-use facilities needs to be taken into account, including shared parking, hours of use, and the impact these may have on the character and amenity of the area, the living conditions of local residents, as well as consideration as to how flexible spaces will be used e.g. sufficient storage for different users and security considerations. 24.10 The Council’s Indoor Sports Facility Needs Assessment highlights the need for new facilities within the borough and will be updated in 2023. Where possible and feasible, such provision should be provided on-site in line with the Council’s Indoor Sports Facility Needs Assessment. The supporting text to Policy 37 deals with the use of Community Use Agreements and artificial pitches, which may also be relevant to indoor facilities. Loss of social or community infrastructure 24.11 Development pressures and high land values in the borough mean there is pressure to redevelop sites and it can be difficult to find new sites for community use, especially for use by voluntary groups. The Council will resist the loss or change of use of existing social or community infrastructure. Consequently, the potential of re-using, refurbishing or redeveloping existing sites for continued social or community infrastructure use must be assessed in order to preserve a sufficient range and amount of such infrastructure across the borough. As outlined above, the flexibility for change of use within Class E means that a wide range of social and community infrastructure uses can occur without the need for a planning application and should improve the prospects of finding an alternative social and community infrastructure use. 24.12 To assess the loss of social infrastructure, the Council will require evidence to justify the loss and demonstrate that it is no longer an essential local facility. The applicant must demonstrate that either-­ 1. there is no longer a community need for the facilities or they no longer meet the needs of users and cannot be adapted in any way. This should be based on evidential need and related to the Council’s and its partners strategies and plans and may include evidence of a public disposal process. Where the application relates to the loss of a health facility, the requirements of Policy 51 Health and Wellbeing will also need to be addressed and written agreement from the Southwest London Integrated Care System, NHS England, or other relevant health body must be provided; or 2. the existing facilities are being adequately re-provided in a different way or elsewhere in a convenient alternative location that is accessible to the current community it supports, or that there are sufficient suitable alternative facilities in the locality. Any redevelopment proposal must not lead to or increase any shortfall in provision. Consideration will be given to whether alternative facilities are accessible to all, well located and sustainable. 3. Alongside either 1 or 2 as set out above, it is essential that the potential of re-using or redeveloping the existing site for the same or an alternative social infrastructure use for which there is a local need is assessed. This should include a full and proper marketing exercise ongoing for a period of at least 18 months. As part of the marketing process space should be offered at a reasonable charge for community groups / voluntary sector organisations reflecting its existing use value and condition. More detailed information on marketing requirements is provided in Appendix 2.Where the site is an existing health facility, consideration should first be given to re-using the site for other health facilities and applicants should contact NHS Property Services to 352",

Early engagement with Sport England is encouraged where a proposal affects an existing indoor sport facility. 24.14 In some cases, change might be inevitable, for example to meet the changing needs of users or through multi-use to make continued provision more economically viable. Any strategies produced by third parties demonstrating local need should have been subject to consultation with appropriate bodies to demonstrate the robustness of the evidence to the Council. If a public disposal process has taken place as part of an agreed programme of social infrastructure reprovision which confirms that the disposal of assets is necessary to ensure continued delivery of social infrastructure and related services, for example, NHS service transformation and estate strategies, this will be taken into account by the Council when assessing proposals against the criteria set out in this policy. 24.15 Where the Council is satisfied that the above evidence has been provided and redevelopment away from a social or community infrastructure use or an educational use may be appropriate, redevelopment or change of use for employment generating uses should be considered. 24.16 In a Borough which has such high land values and an acute need for affordable housing, the Council will consider an exception to parts C.3 and D of this policy, where a scheme proposes the redevelopment or change of use of the site to 100% genuinely affordable housing, and where such is in accordance with Policy 11 Affordable Housing in terms of mix, tenure and affordability. Part C.1 or C.2 would still need to be addressed first. This is to assist in meeting local priority needs, in recognition of the wider community benefits of delivering affordable housing. If an economic viability case is put forward, at the point of consideration of a planning application or through any subsequent variation, to justify less than 100% affordable housing or a different tenure mix that is not policy compliant, then this exception to parts C.3 and D would not apply. Impacts on existing social infrastructure 24.17 Development proposals for major developments are likely to put an additional burden on existing facilities, particularly on education and health infrastructure. Therefore, the potential impact of development proposals on existing social and community infrastructure must be assessed by the applicant as part of the planning application process, supported by evidence, to ensure that there is capacity within the existing infrastructure. For applications for 10 or more residential units, this should be addressed in a Supporting Planning Statement and a Health Impact Assessment, as required (in accordance with the Local Validation Checklist and Policy 51 and/or through an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for projects above the threshold. Where necessary, measures will need to be put in place to mitigate the impacts of development on existing services. This could include financial contributions and / or Planning Obligations (in line with the Council's Planning Obligations SPD), and / or where appropriate, on-site provision of community facilities. Assets of Community Value 24.18 Community groups have a right to nominate buildings or other land as Assets of Community Value where they believe they are of importance to their community’s social well-being. The Council manages and displays this list on the Council’s website. If the asset comes up for sale, then the community will be given six months to make a bid to buy it on the open market.The Assets of Community Value process is helpful in testing the viability of community uses as the bidding process will demonstrate whether there are workable proposals to sustain or reuse the premises. 353",

This policy applies to all ages and abilities, including special education needs, and therefore includes childcare, primary and secondary schools, sixth forms as well as higher and further education. 24.23 Co-location and multi-use of education facilities with other social infrastructure and community uses will be encouraged where practicable, in line with Policy 49 Social and Community Infrastructure. Multi-use and co-location of facilities contributes to optimising the use of land and can increase the wider community benefits of educational proposals. It can lead to increased public access, particularly of sports facilities (indoor and outdoor) through, for example, the use of school playing fields by professional sport clubs, other schools and community groups. The Council will seek to ensure multi- / community use of schools, including private schools, through appropriate measures, such as Community Use Agreements. Meeting educational needs and delivery of new schools 24.24 Under Section 14 of the Education Act 1996, the Council has a duty to ensure the provision of sufficient state-funded school places for all those residents who want them for their children. In accordance with the Academies Act 2010, any new non-voluntary-aided school must in effect be a free school. (Voluntary-aided schools are generally religious or faith schools.) 24.25 The Council’s ability to meet its statutory duty to provide the number and range of school places has, in recent years, become more challenging as a result of the national freedoms and flexibilities which enable different providers to come into the market through the free school route. The role of local authorities has been significantly reduced as a result. 24.26 Consequently, the Council has to work with a variety of organisations who could, in theory, regard themselves as more independent than the Council's existing community schools and converter academies. In addition, the Council does not know until quite late in the process whether the Department for Education will accept a free school proposal in order that the required places can be created and if, through the Education and Skills Funding Agency, they will then be able to find a suitable site for the school.This challenge is compounded by the choices made by parents as to whether to use private sector establishments as an alternative, and due to the Greenwich Judgement, places in local schools cannot be reserved only for children resident in the borough. As a result of the above factors, the Council's overall ability to forecast demand and plan for school places accurately is challenging. 24.27 Notwithstanding the above challenge, the School Place Planning Strategy for the borough, which is reviewed regularly, sets out the anticipated likely demand for school places and how this will be met over the next ten years. Although there has been significant progress made in recent times, this has involved the usage of much of the usable space on existing schools’ sites.The Strategy includes the demand for additional primary places within each of the ten school place planning areas and when further secondary phase places will be required. The potential medium to longer-term implications on the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of birth rates, migration, and socioeconomic factors which may impact on future demand for school places, will be kept under review. At this stage, all land and buildings in education use are safeguarded, such as the former Strathmore School site in Meadlands Drive, Petersham. 24.28 In addition, the Council is required to plan for an increase in school places for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).There are over 4,000 children and young people aged between 0 and 25 years with SEND living in the borough. About 1,600 of these have an Education Health and Care Plan (EHCP), whilst the remainder may be receiving SEND support at school, additional support in early years or post-16 education provision such as a nursery or college, or following a vocational pathway 355",

These needs are forecast to grow in the School Place Planning Strategy. 24.29 The Council will assist in identifying and, where appropriate, allocating sites for educational uses to support the provision of sufficient state-funded primary and secondary school places during the Local Plan period. In this context, the Council works closely with the Education and Skills Funding Agency and the Department for Education to identify possible sites for new schools and, where appropriate, to indicate its support for free school proposals. Access by public transport should be a consideration in reducing traffic impacts when identifying locations for new educational facilities. 24.30 The Council recognises that the independent sector makes a contribution to providing education facilities for the borough’s children and young people. The Council is generally supportive of proposals which increase the provision of places within that sector, provided they can evidence that they meet local need. 24.31 Adequately sized sites for new schools within the areas of the borough where additional places are needed are extremely rare. The following sites are identified for educational uses as part of this Local Plan: Stag Brewery, Mortlake: provision of a new 6-form entry secondary school, including sixth form; Barnes Hospital, Barnes: provision of a Special Education Needs school. 24.32 The Council will work with the Education and Skills Funding Agency, Department for Education, landowners and other partners to identify and, where necessary, allocate sites for the future provision of schools to meet the needs of local communities and enable the Council to meet its duty under the Education Act. Ongoing work is taking place to identify other potential sites for educational uses in the borough. 24.33 In addition, the Council is committed to future working with St Mary's University to address the growth in university places by developing a Masterplan in partnership with the University. Early years and childcare 24.34 Having sufficient childcare in the borough means that families are able to find childcare that meets their child’s learning needs and enables parents to make a real choice about work and training. This applies to all children from birth to age 14, and to children with disabilities. Some children are entitled to free childcare, funded by the government. The Childcare Act 2006 places a duty on the Council to ensure that there are enough childcare places to enable parents to work or train, and there is also a statutory duty to ensure that there are sufficient funded early education places for eligible two, three and four year-olds within the borough. 24.35 The Council’s Childcare Sufficiency Assessment (CSA), which is reviewed regularly, uses data about the need for childcare and the amount of childcare available, to plan how to support the local childcare economy. There are private, voluntary, and independent (PVI) providers, and there are different types of provision, including through the use of childminders. The CSA provides a snapshot, and the situation can change rapidly. The medium and longer-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on working patterns, and the locations where childcare is required, are being kept under review. 24.36 Providers are encouraged to have early discussions with the Council / Achieving for Children Early Years Provision, where proposals affect existing or proposed nursery / pre-school places including funded places and spaces for disadvantaged children. Evidence of such discussions should be submitted with an application to assist in establishing how a proposal meets local needs and priorities, which can respond to changes within the local market while aiming to maintain a mix of provision to allow for choice.

The policy approach to retaining existing nurseries and assessing new or improved nurseries set out above will apply where planning permission is required for a change of use, or to extensions and new development. The Government’s permitted development rights for a change of use from Class E to residential also allow for the impact on the adequate supply of nursery services, which will follow the approach set out above. Where necessary and justified, the Council will use conditions and/or planning obligations to limit uses consented within Class E in order to achieve the objectives of this policy and in line with the NPPF and accompanying PPG to ensure provision of required childcare to meet local needs. Employment and skills training 24.38 The Council will promote local employment opportunities and training programmes, particularly where there are opportunities arising from developments. Securing the skills to support residents into sustainable employment is a key priority for the Council to support the local economy, to raise the bar further for those with higher levels of skills than London averages and make sure some residents with lower skills are not missing out economically. Maximising local labour will also help reduce the need to travel. The construction phase of new development provides opportunities for local employment, apprenticeships and work experience placements. Commercial developments within the borough also bring new employment, apprenticeship and work-experience opportunities for local residents during the end-use phase. Apprenticeships and work experience placements will enable residents to develop an appropriate skill-set for existing and future employment opportunities within the borough. This may be particularly important where the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected specific sectors in the borough. 24.39 Consequently, on all development proposals generating 20 FTE (Full Time Equivalent) jobs or more (this also covers end use jobs and those created within one year of completion of the development), the Council will require Local Employment Agreements (LEA), secured through Section 106 agreements, that set out the skills, employment and training opportunities to be delivered from the development, including how this will be resourced. Such an agreement can make use of existing schemes, such as Richmond Work Match, Way2Work, Construction Training Initiative, schemes run by Registered Providers and developers, provided these manage the development related job opportunities and fulfil the Council's targets and monitoring. 24.40 The number of jobs generated by a development will vary depending on its scale, as well as the end use being proposed. The obligation set out in part B of the policy for an LEA between the developer and the Council will therefore apply to: All residential developments providing 50 units or more; and All commercial developments consisting of 400 sqm or more of employment space. 24.41 The selection of these thresholds is to ensure that the requirement for an LEA is applied to those major developments where there is likely to be scope to provide a significant contribution on site to employment and training opportunities in the borough. Developers are however also encouraged to enter into an LEA on all development sites expected to be above 20 FTE, even if they fall below the above size thresholds. 24.42 The details of the LEA will be subject to negotiation, tailored to site specific circumstances and proportionate to the scale of development proposed, and require developers to bring about the necessary provision to meet the obligations, using reasonable endeavours to incorporate in their 357",

Developers will be expected to work with the Council to promote and advertise tender opportunities and to achieve the procurement of construction contracts and goods and services from companies and organisations based in the borough. 24.44 A developer can set out justification as to why it may not be possible to deliver any of the requirements highlighted, if there are circumstances specific to the scheme (e.g. specialised labour requirements from the end user) such that direct provision is not operationally feasible, or that an alternative means of delivery would result in a more effective outcome.

This emphasises the whole life course of ‘Start Well, Live Well and Age Well’, which encompasses residents of all ages and demographics, that is also the basis of the Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategy. The Council’s Prevention Framework 2021 to 2025 aims to embed prevention in the Council’s wider work, particularly through the environment, to promote positive health and wellbeing and to address health inequalities. 25.3 The London Plan sets out that many determinants of health and wellbeing that can be shaped by the planning system, for example from transport and housing through to air quality and climate change, along with healthcare provision. It seeks an integrated and co-ordinated way to improving the mental and physical health of all Londoners. The London Plan promotes a Healthy Streets Approach to put improving health and reducing health inequalities at the heart of public space, which links with active travel. Inclusive Design 25.4 An inclusive design approach is intended to ensure the diverse needs of all are integrated into proposals from the outset. This is essential to ensuring that the built environment, both the internal and external parts of buildings and the spaces in between, are safe, accessible, and convenient for all. 25.5 One of the draft priorities for the new Community Safety Strategy, being brought forward in 2023 by the Richmond Community Partnership, is for safer neighbourhoods: crime and anti-social behaviour including volume crime such as burglary and motor vehicle crime, violent crime such as robbery and knife crime – and keeping children and young people safe. The Council has committed to developing an ambitious, long-term strategic approach to ending violence against women and girls, in the Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy 2022- 25, and through planning for example inclusive design can ensure women feel visible and safe in public spaces. The borough has had the lowest crime rate in London for the last three years, although the layout of development and public realm, encouraging active and continual use of spaces, can reduce opportunities for crime and anti-social behaviour and the fear of crime. Designing out crime is also identified in Policy 28 'Local Character and Design Quality (Strategic Policy)', in Policy 19 'Managing the Impacts of Development on Surroundings ' in considering ways to manage impacts of evening and food and drink uses, and Policy 43 'Floodlighting and Other External Artificial Lighting ' in recognising the benefits of floodlighting for safety of movement. 25.6 Public toilets are a vital facility, and should be provided as part of major development that are open to the public, such as shops, sport, leisure and health care facilities, transport hubs, cultural and civic buildings, and large areas of public realm. The supporting text to London Plan Policy S6 sets out that a range of toilet facilities should be provided, and that provision should be safe, well-lit and clean with ongoing management and cleaning secured at the planning stage. The provision of Changing Places toilets can open up new areas and experiences for people with profound and multiple impairments, and their companions, removing the barrier that the lack of provision can create. 25.7 The supporting text to London Plan Policy D8 also sets out that the provision of accessible free drinking water fountains helps improve public health, and reduces waste supporting the use of reusable water bottles.

It is recommended that developers have consideration to the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) practice guide [‘Creating better environments for people living](https://www.rtpi.org.uk/practice/2020/september/dementia-and-town-planning/) [with dementia’ (2020) which provides](https://www.rtpi.org.uk/practice/2020/september/dementia-and-town-planning/) practical advice on how to incorporate dementia approaches in development proposals. 25.10 Design of the built environment should specifically consider the needs of the older population such as more seating opportunities and benches. A high quality, inclusive and accessible urban environment will enable the older population to remain independent and active for longer, thereby reducing the need for extensive adaptations to buildings. 25.11 Housing development should consider the needs of the older population. Opportunities to enable older people to downsize is recognised in Policy 13 'Housing Mix and Standards ', along with higher standards for inclusive access, and new accommodation should meet identified local needs as set out in Policy 12 'Housing Needs of Different Groups '. Young People 25.12 What happens in early life, starting from conception, affects health and wellbeing in later life. However, it is often the environment that makes it difficult for children and young people to stay healthy. Growing up in a healthy and safe neighbourhood is a key part of giving children the best start in life; places where children can play safely and access green spaces, breathe clean air, be active, and enjoy a healthy diet. Prevention is critical to ensuring that children and young people can fulfil their potential. 25.13 Planning can play a role in addressing environmental harms and assets in the places and spaces where young people spend the most time outside of the home, including the school, and the local neighbourhood. This links with the approach to restricting the availability of unhealthy foods set out in this policy. It also links to the wider cross-cutting themes and the details set out in other policies in this Plan, for example there are opportunities to work with schools to encourage modal shift to sustainable transport and encourage low pollution walking routes, to prioritise active travel and promote the Healthy Streets approach. Health Impact Assessment 25.14 A Health Impact Assessment (HIA) must be submitted with all major applications. A HIA should assess the health impacts of a development, identifying mitigation measures for any potential negative impacts as well as measures for enhancing any potential positive impacts. The London Healthy Urban Development Unit (HUDU) have developed a rapid HIA tool to quickly assess the impacts of a development plan or proposal and recommend measures, this tool should be used as early as possible in the planning process and established at pre-application stage. As set out in the Planning Obligations SPD, the HUDU guidance and their Planning Contributions Model should be used to calculate the capital cost of the additional health facilities required to meet the increased demand which arises from new developments. Takeaways 25.15 Planning can influence the built environment to support health and wellbeing, this includes helping to reduce obesity and excess weight in local communities. Obesity is one of the greatest health challenges facing London, and the creation of a healthy food environment is therefore important, as set out in the London Plan. Childhood obesity amongst school age children is a concern as evidence suggests that obese children are more likely to be obese adults and are at an increased risk of developing further health difficulties.

Outside of these 400m 'restriction' zones, applications for fast food takeaways will be considered in line with other policies in this plan. 25.17 The following map shows the existing schools within the borough (as of April 2023) and the associated 400 metre buffer area, which are the 'restriction' zones for fast food takeaways: Map 25.1 Existing schools within the borough (as of April 2023) and the associated 400 metre buffer area Health Infrastructure 25.18 The National Health Service (NHS) is facing unprecedented challenges and are working to better integrate health and social care.

This includes the challenge of optimising the redevelopment of health sites and other infrastructure to improve provision and, where appropriate, contribute more widely to the area health needs. 25.19 The South West London Integrated Care System is the partnership responsible for planning, commissioning and buying health services for the borough.

This is seeking to remove barriers that prevented an integrated system, to remove traditional divisions between hospitals and family doctors, between physical and mental health, and between NHS and council services. In the past, these divisions meant that too many people experienced disjointed care. It has established new partnerships between the organisations that meet health and care needs across an area, to coordinate services and to plan in a way that improves population health and reduces inequalities between different groups. It builds on the NHS Long Term Plan and continues to support the plan’s triple aim: Better Health for Everyone; Better Care for All Patients; and Sustainability of local and national NHS system. Place Leaders on behalf of the NHS work with partners such as the local authority and voluntary sector in an inclusive, transparent and collaborative way. 25.21 A Richmond Health and Care Estates Strategy has been prepared during 2021. Overall, this is to support new models of care and integrated working, developing flexible spaces and optimising use of the estate.With a broader model of health and social care working in a multidisciplinary way, there may be a future focus around health and social care community hubs to bring services to local areas. Flexible spaces could be used for social prescribing, including for community and voluntary groups, as a way that GPs, nurses and other primary care professionals can refer patients to local, non-clinical services to address health concerns and improve a patient’s overall wellbeing, while reducing demands on primary (e.g. GPs) and secondary (e.g. hospital and community) care. Digitisation will also be key, and could bring efficiencies for example to access advice or for records storage, provided the digital infrastructure supports these ways of working in the health sector.The South West London Integrated Care System are also preparing an estates strategy. 25.22 There is pressure on health facilities in the borough with currently some shortfall in GP floorspace in parts of the borough. Existing health facilities should be protected and the provision of new or improved facilities appropriate to local needs is encouraged. Applications for new or loss of health and social care facilities will be considered in line with the criteria of Policy 49 Social and Community Infrastructure and paragraph 24.12 sets out that written agreement of the relevant health body must be provided to assess the loss of any existing health facilities. 25.23 While this Plan supports health and social care provision for meeting local needs, the flexibility introduced by Government through Use Class E (commercial, business and service uses) does in principle allow for changes of use both to and from other Class E uses and medical / health services, provided there are no restrictive conditions on a specific property. The policy approach to retaining existing health facilities and assessing new or improved health and social care facilities set out above will apply where planning permission is required for a change of use, or to extensions and new development.Where necessary and justified, the Council will use conditions and/or planning obligations to limit uses consented within Class E in order to achieve the objectives of this policy and in line with the NPPF and accompanying PPG to ensure provision of required health infrastructure to meet local needs. 363",

They provide recreational value, support biodiversity and landscape quality, contribute to physical and mental wellbeing, provide the possibility to grow fresh produce and contribute towards a healthy lifestyle that is active, sustainable and socially inclusive. 25.25 There are currently 24 allotment sites in the borough that are managed by the Council, nine of which are designated as statutory allotments. All apart from three sites are on Council owned land and the remainder are on Crown land. There are also two private sites in the borough. Statutory allotments have legal protection and these sites cannot be sold or used for other purposes without the consent of the Secretary of State. Allotments are an open community use and are appropriate within Metropolitan Open Land. Most of the non-statutory allotments are designated as other open land designations such as Green Belt, Metropolitan Open Land and Other Open Land of Townscape Importance and as such are protected from inappropriate development. 25.26 Allotments address individual and social well-being, by offering physical activity and outdoor exercise, a sense of pride and achievement and the production of good value and nutritional fruit and vegetables. However, they have a wider role as they form a part of the open space resource of the borough and can be a focus of educational interest and public engagement, neighbourliness and social solidarity. Allotment sites also make a contribution to the important areas of biodiversity and sustainability. It is worth noting that family members and friends often join in with activities on the allotments or share in its produce. The value is therefore not confined to the individual plot holders but spreads outwards in a ripple effect, representing an important opportunity for community interaction. 25.27 The Borough’s Open Space Assessment (2023) identifies a sufficient number of allotment plots within the borough due to some plots being split to create smaller, flexible and more manageable plots to meet the needs of a wider array of people. This [approach, set out in the borough’s Allotment](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/media/5685/allotment_strategy.pdf) [strategy 2019-2029 and supported by the](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/media/5685/allotment_strategy.pdf) GLA and other organisations, results in 28.7 plots per 2,301 residents against a target of 20 plots per 2,301 residents. 25.28 Where appropriate, the provision of new allotments or other food growing space, alongside the provision of other private, semi-private and public open spaces, will be supported if opportunities arise as part of new developments. This could include the innovative small-scale use of roofs, walls and balconies, especially where external space is limited. 364",

Climate change is now the greatest challenge facing our society. The Local Plan places the environment at the centre of the Council’s consideration of new development proposals. 25.30 Development should not contribute to, be at risk from or adversely affected by, unacceptable levels of air, noise, odour, light, soil and water pollution or land instability. Developers should explore ways to minimise any harmful and adverse environmental impacts of development, including during construction and demolition.Where possible, development that is likely to generate pollution should be located away from sensitive uses such as hospitals, schools, care homes and wildlife sites.The design and layout of new development should minimise conflict between different land uses, taking account of users and occupiers of new and existing developments. Therefore, any noisy or polluting activities or features such as plant equipment, should be positioned away from sensitive areas where possible to ensure any detrimental impacts on health, living conditions or amenity are kept to acceptable levels. 25.31 In addition, where there are already significant adverse effects on the environment, amenity or living conditions due to pollution, sensitive uses should ideally be steered away from those areas. However, given the limited availability of land for development in this borough, this will not always be possible. Therefore, new developments, including changes of use, should mitigate and reduce any adverse impacts resulting from air and light pollution, noise, vibration and dust to acceptable levels. 25.32 The Agent of Change principle places the responsibility of mitigating the impact of nuisances (including noise) from existing nuisance-generating uses on proposed new development close by, thereby ensuring that residents and users of the new development are protected from nuisances, and existing uses are protected from nuisance complaints. Applications for new development likely to be impacted by existing noise or other nuisance-generating uses will require the submission of a relevant impact assessment to determine the impact and help inform the necessary mitigation measures to make the development acceptable. The Agent of Change principle works both ways; therefore, any new nuisance-generating development will need to put in place measures to mitigate noise impacts on existing development close by. Further information on the Agent of Change principle is included in the NPPF, PPG and London Plan, which set out how to mitigate the adverse impacts of noise as well as other such as air and light pollution. Air Quality 25.33 Good air quality is vital to health and wellbeing. There are a number of areas in the borough that do not comply with the air quality targets and action must be taken to control, minimise and reduce the contributing factors of poor air quality. The whole of the borough has been declared as an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) and as such any new development and its impact upon air quality must be considered very carefully. Strict mitigation will be required for any developments proposed within or adjacent to ‘Air Quality Focus Areas’. An ‘Air Quality Focus Area’ is a location that has been identified as having high levels of pollution (i.e. exceeding the Government annual mean limit value for nitrogen dioxide) and human exposure. Air Quality Focus Areas are designated by the Greater London Authority. The Council will consider the impact of introducing new developments to areas already subject to poor air quality, and the impact on the new occupiers of that development, especially in sensitive uses such as schools. 25.34 To tackle poor air quality, protect health and meet legal obligations, minor developments are required to be at least “Air Quality Neutral” or “Emissions Neutral”. Major development proposals must be submitted with an Air Quality Assessment which will be enough to demonstrate that they are in accordance with Part B1 of London Plan Policy SI 1.

Additional measures may also be needed to address local impacts. The Mayor’s Air Quality Neutral LPG (2023) and Air Quality Positive LPG (2023) set out air quality benchmarks for all development, as well as a simplified approach for minor developments. 25.35 'Air Quality Positive' means making an active contribution to improving air quality in and around a development site or masterplan area and minimising exposure to existing sources of poor air quality. The key aim of the Air Quality Positive (AQP) Statement is to demonstrate how all aspects of a development – including the buildings, public spaces, landscaping and infrastructure – have responded to their environment, contributed to improvement and implemented best practice in relation to air quality. Compiling the statement should ideally be a continuous process throughout development design. 25.36 Although developers are expected to use appropriate mitigation measures to avoid adverse impacts, the Council will seek financial contributions through the use of Planning Obligations towards air quality measures where a proposed development is not air quality neutral or mitigation measures do not sufficiently reduce the harm to air quality. Developers will be required to contribute to off-site measures by making a financial contribution to the Borough’s Air Quality Action Fund (AQAF) secured through a Section 106 Agreement. Further details are set out in the Council’s Air Quality SPD including the rates for calculating contributions and how funds will be spent. 25.37 The Council’s Air Quality SPD (2020) as well as a Development Control for Noise Generating and Noise Sensitive Development SPD (2018), need to be followed. 25.38 The Council’s Air Quality Action Plan 2020–2025 identifies actions and mitigating measures, to be implemented by the Council and partners, to reduce NO2 and PM10 borough wide from main emission sources including road transport and new developments. Noise and Vibration 25.39 Noise and/or vibration arise from a variety of sources, such as major roads, railways and aircraft, as well as industrial and commercial sources.This can have a significant effect on health, quality of life, amenity, living conditions and the environment in general. This therefore needs to be considered when new developments may create noise and vibration, and also when new developments would be sensitive to existing conditions. 25.40 Applicants need to consider acoustic design at an early stage of the planning process to ensure occupiers of new and existing noise sensitive buildings are protected.The Council has adopted a SPD for Development Control for Noise Generating and Noise Sensitive Development. This sets out guidance intended to help protect the local occupiers of new or existing noise sensitive buildings from existing or introduced noise sources, and, where possible, improve amenity and living conditions. The SPD will assist applicants, decision makers, agents, occupiers and others to identify issues to be addressed in any planning application in which noise and/or vibration will be an important consideration. 25.41 The Agent of Change principle places the responsibility for mitigating impacts from existing noise-generating activities or uses on the proposed new noise-sensitive development. In other words, the person or business responsible for the change must also be responsible for managing the impact of the change. New development must be integrated effectively with existing businesses and community facilities (such as places of worship, pubs, music venues and sports clubs). These existing businesses and facilities should not have unreasonable restrictions placed on them as a result of development permitted after they were established. Where the operation of an existing business or community facility could have a significant adverse effect on new development (including changes of use) in its vicinity, the applicant (or ‘agent of change’) should be required to provide suitable mitigation before the development has been completed. 368",

As part of the development process steps must be taken to ensure that the impact of artificial lighting is considered carefully. Odours and Fume Control 25.43 Some commercial activities can have an impact upon the local environment; these impacts can include such things as odours, fumes, dust and steam. As part of the development process steps must be taken to ensure that any impact is considered carefully and that mitigation is in place to manage these types of emissions. 25.44 Applicants will be required to apply the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs' (DEFRA) Guidance on the Control of Odour and Noise from Commercial Kitchen Exhaust Systems. Land Contamination 25.45 A wide range of uses have occurred in the borough throughout its history and there are areas where small scale industrial uses, such as factories, garages, manufacturing works and wharves were once present, and which may have left a legacy of contamination. All new development in the borough is envisaged to occur on previously developed land (i.e. brownfield sites) and therefore remediation is encouraged.The duty to ensure that a safe development is secured on a site that is affected by contamination rests with the developer. Where development comes forward potential contamination risks will need to be properly considered and adequately mitigated before development proceeds. Most of the borough is identified as being at risk of groundwater flooding, which can increase the risk of land contamination from development, and there are identified throughflow and groundwater policy zones. Development will be expected to minimise and mitigate this risk, in line with Policy 8 'Flood Risk and Sustainable Drainage (Strategic Policy) ' and Policy 9 'Water Resources and Infrastructure (Strategic Policy) ' of this Plan. 25.46 To deliver this the Council will: 1. require a desk top study and preliminary risk assessment, including an assessment of the site's history, potential contamination sources, pathways and receptors; 2. where necessary, require a site investigation and detailed risk assessment in line with current best practice guidance, including where appropriate physical investigations, chemical testing, and interpretation of the results, and assessment of risks to groundwater; 3. where necessary, require a remediation strategy that sets out how any identified risks from the reports above are going to be addressed; 4. where necessary, require a validation report once remediation has taken place, including evidence that demonstrates that risks from contamination have been controlled effectively; and 5. require all above reports and investigations to be carried out by an aptly qualified person. Construction and demolition 25.47 There is a need to ensure that occupiers are protected from environmental disturbances during the construction and demolition phase of major developments, and in particular during excavating and construction of subterranean developments such as basements. 25.48 The Council requires the submission of Construction Management Plans (CMP) for the types of developments as set out in the policy. In addition, the Council's Good Practice Guide on Basement Developments sets out guidance to ensure that problems relating to excavation and constructions of basements, such as highway/parking impacts, noise, dust, vibration and disturbance to neighbours, are avoided.

It will also be necessary to control the hours of operation for noisy site works and the processes that would need to be followed in order to work outside these hours when and if required. As part of the Council's commitment to better air quality, the Council will also request, through planning conditions, that the GLA Regulation relating to Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM) is imposed at all times.

Subterranean and other basement developments are considered to be 'development' as defined by the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as amended. Therefore, planning permission is required for the carrying out of basement developments. The Council has made two Article 4 Directions that came into effect on 1 April 2018, which remove permitted development rights across the whole borough for basement and subterranean developments. 25.51 The development of basements in residential areas is becoming an increasingly popular way of gaining additional space in homes without the need to relocate to larger properties as well as for increasing the value of a property. The shortage of land for development as well as high land values in the borough, coupled with constraints imposed by heritage designations, has led to an increase in the number of applications for basement developments in recent years, whereby the vast majority of these relate to new, or extensions to existing basements, under existing dwellings within established residential areas 25.52 The addition of basements to existing properties is considered to exacerbate the issue of rising residential land and property values in this borough, thus creating even more homes that are not affordable for local communities, and it also contributes to the loss of small family dwellings. Therefore, limiting the size and extent of a basement also ensures that the special character of this borough is preserved and that proposals do not lead to over-development or inappropriate intensification of existing properties. 25.53 Adding basements to existing properties, particularly multiple basements in a residential street or area, can significantly change the character of an area, and can cause significant impacts to living conditions of residents in neighbouring properties. Therefore, this policy restricts the depth of the basement excavation to a single storey where it relates to residential properties or those which were previously in residential use. In this policy, a 'single storey' is one that cannot be subdivided in the future to create additional floors (approximately 2.7 metres floor to ceiling height). 25.54 The policy acknowledges that basements and subterranean developments, including potentially those of more than one storey, can be constructed and used without adverse impacts on the living conditions and amenity of neighbours, provided that the proposal is appropriate for the character of the area and the site allows for appropriate access for plant and machinery to enable construction without adverse impacts. 25.55 In addition, this borough is characterised by low-rise residential areas that benefit from garden areas.

They act as stepping-stone sites for wildlife and improve connectivity between habitats, help reduce flood risk and mitigate the effects of climate change including the heat island effect.They also provide green oases, tranquil areas and amenity space for residents as well as health benefits. The importance of garden areas in this borough is also established by virtue of some being designated as Other Open Land of Townscape Importance. In addition, Policy 15 'Infill and Backland Development' resists the significant loss of garden land. While basements may not have a detrimental impact on the openness of an area, they can introduce a degree of artificiality into the garden area and restrict the range of trees and other planting. Therefore, this policy requires the retention of at least half of each garden to enable biodiversity to flourish, and natural landscapes and the character to be maintained. In addition, this enables the treatment of surface water as close to its source as possible by retaining the infiltration capacity of the un-excavated area of the garden, thus ensuring that proposals do not increase surface water flows onto adjoining properties. 25.56 To support appropriate planting and vegetation that supports biodiversity as well as to allow for sustainable drainage, the Council will require a soil depth over any part of the basement beneath a garden of a minimum of 1 metre, together with a minimum 200mm drainage layer.This will allow for both a reduction in the amount as well as speed of surface water runoff, whereby the surface water drainage regime above the basement should be connected to the unaffected part of the garden area. 25.57 All basement and subterranean development should be installed with a pumped sewerage system to prevent flooding from back flow in public sewerage system as recognised in Part H of the Building Regulations, with further details set out in Policy 8 'Flood Risk and Sustainable Drainage (Strategic Policy) '. Issues of groundwater ingress to basement levels should be addressed by property owners. In areas at risk of flooding, Policy 8 'Flood Risk and Sustainable Drainage (Strategic Policy) ' will be applied, which restricts certain types of basements and uses in accordance with the relevant flood zones, for example, restricted uses include self-contained units and bedrooms at basement level. In addition, any sub-surface, basement and cellar proposals within throughflow and groundwater policy zones and/or in an area with >=25% susceptibility to groundwater flooding are required to carry out a site-specific Screen Assessment, which has to be undertaken by a chartered professional, to assess the likely impacts from subterranean development. It should address: the impacts of the proposed subsurface development on the area's subterranean characteristics; land stability; and flood risk and drainage. 25.58 If the Screening Assessment determines that the proposed subsurface development may have an impact on the local environment, or if it determines that further investigation work is required, then a Basement Impact Assessment is required, which has to be undertaken by a chartered professional. A Site and Assessment Verification Form has to be completed by the chartered professional who undertook the assessment and submitted as part of the application. The Council’s [Basement Assessment User Guide provides](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/planning/basement_developments) more information and guidance on Screening Assessments and Basement Impact Assessments. 25.59 Basements and subterranean developments can suffer inundation from flood water entering the basement from above. Policy 8 'Flood Risk and Sustainable Drainage (Strategic Policy) ' of this Plan sets out restrictions for basement developments in areas at risk of flooding. In addition, basements are vulnerable to groundwater entering through the walls and floors as well as service entries. Applicants should follow the BSI Code of Practice for protection of below ground structures against water from the ground (BS 8102:2009). 25.60 The impact of basement and subterranean construction, including issues relating to noise, dust, disturbance and structural stability of surrounding properties as well as 372",

While Planning has limited powers to control the construction processes, it does have an important role in protecting amenity and living conditions.This policy seeks to ensure that the amenity, living conditions and the health and wellbeing of nearby residents are protected by reducing the impacts from construction works, such as noise, vibration, soil removal and associated plant, machinery and heavy vehicles. Therefore, a Construction Management Plan (CMP), as set out in the Council's Local Validation Checklist, will be required for all types of basement and subterranean developments. 25.61 There are concerns over the impacts of basements and subterranean developments on the structural stability of the host building as well as of adjacent and potentially other nearby properties. Careful control is required to manage the detrimental impacts of basement and subterranean developments and to prevent long-term harm to amenity and living conditions of the local community. 25.62 Due to the potential irreversible detrimental harm to the historic integrity and risks to structural damage, particular care and attention needs to be taken where a subterranean or basement development could affect a designated heritage asset, such as a listed building or the associated garden land of a listed building. Proposals will also need to consider the potential archaeological impacts in Archaeological Priority Areas (APAs) where relevant. Therefore, where a subterranean development or basement is added to, or adjacent to, a listed building, a Structural Impact Assessment, including written confirmation that the applicant will pay for the structural report to be independently assessed, will be required. In Conservation Areas, basements should conserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. This is particularly relevant in relation to external visible features such as light wells and railings, which may impact on the character of Conservation Areas. 25.63 The environmental impact of basement and subterranean developments is arguably greater than the equivalent above ground development due to the increased energy and resource requirements in their construction and use (e.g. heating and lighting). The Council therefore expects all basement development proposals to demonstrate that they have sought to minimise their environmental impact in accordance with the relevant climate change, sustainable construction standards and circular economy policies of this Plan. 25.64 The Council's Good Practice Guide on Basement Developments sets out guidance to ensure that problems relating to excavation and constructions of basements, such as highway/parking impacts, noise, dust, vibration and disturbance to neighbours, are avoided. It is expected that all developers for basement and subterranean works follow this guidance. In addition, developers and contractors of basements and subterranean developments are expected to sign up to a Considerate Construction Scheme. The Council strongly recommends for contractors undertaking basement construction to have membership of the Association of Specialist Underpinning Contractors (ASUC) or another suitable body. Applicants, and particularly contractors, should also follow the ASUC ‘Guidelines on safe and efficient basement construction directly below or near to existing structures’ (last updated in August 2016), which has been endorsed by the Health and Safety Executive. 25.65 Applicants wishing to undertake basement and subterranean developments are strongly advised to discuss their proposal with neighbours and other parties, who may be affected, by commencing Party Wall negotiations and discussing the scheme with the Council prior to the submission of a planning application. 373",

This section also covers how the Council can take enforcement action 26.5 against unauthorised development, and undertakes regular monitoring to ensure the plan is effective and where interventions may be needed to achieve the objectives of the Plan. Implementation of the Local Plan 26.2 The new Local Plan sets out the strategy and vision of how the borough will accommodate growth which provides enough homes, jobs, school places and health facilities for existing and new residents. Over the course of this plan the Council will be expected to deliver 4110 new homes. This will put pressure on existing infrastructure such as water waste, energy and transport. 26.3 The Local Plan will be implemented and delivered through a combination of private 26.6 sector investment, the work of other agencies and bodies, and the Councils own strategies and initiatives. The majority of new development identified in the Plan’s site allocations, particularly investment in new infrastructure, housing and jobs, will be delivered by the private sector. Physical, social and green infrastructure is provided and managed by a wide range of organisations in Richmond. This includes Transport for London, Network Rail, statutory undertakers such as Thames Water and other parts of the public sector such as the NHS and their various trusts and educational providers. The community and voluntary sector will play a key role in implementation. The Council will engage with all of the partner organisations throughout the plan period to make sure that delivery of infrastructure is provided at the right time and in the right 26.7 place. 26.4 The emphasis in this Plan is on the ‘Living Locally’ concept which requires the provision of infrastructure to create and support 20-minute neighbourhoods. This cuts across all the ten themes and the Plan as a whole, in terms of the locations of homes, places to work and for leisure, and improvements such 375 as towards active travel and green infrastructure. All new development will deliver improvements to support the living locally concept. Through responding to the climate emergency and taking action, infrastructure will be adapted to become more climate resilient to cope with drought and flooding, along with investment to build a low carbon society, particularly for energy, waste and water.There will be increasing use of low and zero carbon heat sources and decarbonisation of existing heat networks. There will be more efficient use of water resources and supply, and an improvement in water quality in the borough’s rivers.There will be use of materials, and provision for storage and collection which minimise waste and enable a circular economy. Buildings and infrastructure will enable residents, businesses and visitors in the borough to contribute to achieving a net-zero carbon borough by 2043. At least 4,110 homes will need to be built in the borough over the next 10 years, as envisaged through delivering new homes and an affordable borough for all. These new homes will largely be delivered by the private sector in residential-led as well as mixed use schemes. The main locations for new housing across the borough are identified in the spatial strategy and the relevant Housing policies of this Plan. The Plan emphasises the need for genuinely affordable housing due to the acute affordable housing crisis. Affordable housing will be secured through planning obligations, by private developers and Registered Providers (RPs) of affordable housing. The Council will support the delivery of further affordable housing that will be provided by RPs' own schemes. The spatial strategy highlights that by 2039 there is an under-supply of 6,200 sqm gross of retail and food/beverage floorspace requirements. As set out in Shaping and supporting our town and local centres as they adapt to changes in the way we shop and respond to the pandemic, the focus will be on the repurposing of retail space to enable our centres to diversify their offer and facilitate adaption to meet changing needs.",

In particular, Richmond Station and Kew Retail Park are major redevelopment opportunities. 26.8 A key focus is on place-making in our town and local centres, so that by improving design, delivering beautiful buildings and high-quality places they will be destinations with places to meet, shop, work and for leisure, acting as hubs and supporting Living Locally. While development from the private sector is expected to follow a design- and character-led approach, funding for public realm improvements can come from the Council, GLA and central Government, as well as through Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) and local schemes.There will be a partnership approach within the Council, such as licensing, working with business associations, and with other agencies such as the Police, to manage impacts and take a holistic approach. All development across the borough will take account of design codes and the Urban Design Study, to recognise the unique and distinctive character and delivers high-quality design. 26.9 The emphasis on increasing jobs and helping business to grow and bounceback following the pandemic is on providing a variety of affordable and adaptable workspaces, supporting the borough’s locally important sectors and enterprise. The provision of employment space will be delivered by the private sector, this is expected through employment-led intensification and new commercial uses in locations identified in the spatial strategy and employment policies of this Plan. Provision of affordable workspace and support for local employment opportunities and training programmes will be secured through planning obligations in appropriate schemes. Good telecommunications connectivity will be provided, including broadband connections and mobile connectivity, particularly to enable smart technologies and data to support economic growth. 26.10 With the emphasis on reducing the need to travel and improving the choices for more sustainable travel, improvements to transport infrastructure particularly for walking, cycling and public transport will be essential to delivery of the Plan. All development will follow the Healthy Streets approach so the design and management of streets will support activities in the public realm and facilitate a shift to active travel, which also encourages improvements in air quality and promotes healthy lifestyles. The Council will support active travel projects and improvements to public transport, including improving interchange and accessibility. Improvements are largely delivered by Government, Transport for London and other public transport operating companies. Funding for improvements will be provided in part through the Community Infrastructure Levy, and where appropriate, developer contributions through planning obligations will be sought from relevant development sites. A detailed list of transport projects and infrastructure requirements is set out in the Council’s Infrastructure Delivery Plan and Infrastructure Delivery Schedule. There are aspirations for a new foot and cycle bridge across the River Thames and opportunities to support new technology such as the establishment of e-mobility services. 26.11 Through protecting what is special and improving our areas (heritage and culture) the importance of heritage assets will be realised. The repair, restoration or maintenance of a heritage asset will be captured in a planning obligation where relevant to development, as well as opportunities to increase public access. Enhancements to the cultural and community offer will be provided by trusts, interest and faith groups, and commercial enterprises, to support the cultural quarters in Richmond and Twickenham and clusters across the borough. 26.12 There will be enhancements to the multi-functional networks through increasing biodiversity and the quality of our green and blue spaces, and greening the borough .The emphasis in the Plan is on the benefits for health and well-being, climate change, and connecting with nature.

Major new development will provide on-site green spaces. 26.13 As set out in Securing new social and community infrastructure to support a growing population, the Council will work with service providers and developers to ensure the adequate provision of community services and facilities, especially in areas where there is an identified need or shortage. There is an emphasis on flexible spaces that can adapt to change, particularly to serve “Living Locally”. New community and social infrastructure facilities are also expected to be delivered on a variety of sites as identified in this Plan. School place planning is complex, not least as national freedoms and flexibilities enable different providers to come into the market through the free school route. A key challenge will be to ensure provision of sufficient state-funded school places, as adequately sized sites for new schools within the borough are extremely rare. The Council will work with partners, including the Education Funding Agency as well as educational providers, to ensure the provision of the quantity and diversity of school places needed within the borough. The Local Plan identifies land for new educational use at Stag Brewery and Barnes Hospital. 26.14 Creating safe, healthy and inclusive communities will also be integral across a range of infrastructure, and ensuring places will genuinely cater for all needs. The activities of other key partner agencies and bodies, such as the South West London Integrated Care System and NHS partner organisations, who are responsible for delivering health services in the borough. There is continuing estate optimisation, with shortfalls in GP floorspace in parts of the borough, and there will be new models for integrating health and care needs, with flexible spaces and community hubs to bring services to local areas. There are pockets of relative disadvantage around Castelnau, Ham, Hampton Nursery Lands, Heathfield, Mortlake and Whitton. The community and voluntary sector will also be a key partner to deliver services and facilities to meet people’s needs. 26.15 Further information including a detailed list of projects and infrastructure requirements to support development is set out in the Council's Infrastructure Delivery Plan and Infrastructure Delivery Schedule. Infrastructure Delivery 26.16 The Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP), updated in 2023, is part of the evidence base that has informed the policies contained within this Plan. For the purpose of the Local Plan and the IDP, 'essential community infrastructure' is defined as 'any physical structure, facility or service, whether privately or publicly funded, that supports or enables growing communities'. The IDP provides an infrastructure assessment, identifying future infrastructure and service needs for the borough, specifically by: providing an analysis of existing infrastructure provision and identifying how well existing needs are met; identifying future infrastructure requirements to support new development and a growing and changing population, housing and employment growth; providing an indication of the potential costs and means and sources of funding the required infrastructure, including public funding, developer contributions and other sources; and providing a justification for the continued operation of the borough Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) (introduced in November 2014). 26.17 The scope of facilities that have been investigated as part of the IDP includes the following: Social and community infrastructure including early years education, primary and secondary as well as special needs education, further/higher/adult education, health care (including hospitals and GPs), adult social care, sport facilities including leisure facilities such as sports halls and indoor, community centres, youth centres, libraries, affordable housing as well as arts and culture; 377",

Whilst the IDP provides the baseline for infrastructure required to support the sustainable growth of the borough, the IDS provides a detailed analysis of the specific infrastructure projects, including where a need/future demand has been identified. It identifies the costs of new required infrastructure/facilities as well as sources of funding. In addition, it details whether the infrastructure project will be needed in the short-/medium-/long-term, and whether it will need to be delivered in phases. Where applicable, it identifies and includes the location of new infrastructure. The IDS also identifies the relevant delivery partners and any other critical elements that need to be taken account of to ensure the delivery of the necessary infrastructure. 26.20 Both the IDP and IDS provide a snapshot in time and are based on best available information at the time of their production. Needs and demands for infrastructure can change significantly due to unexpected events, for example the opening of a new school may change the demand for school places in a specific area. In addition, they do not provide a definitive or exhaustive list of available funding sources and infrastructure costs as these can also change significantly within a short period of time. Thus, the IDP and IDS are treated as living documents and are therefore monitored and regularly updated. To access the latest IDP and IDS, visit the Council’s website at www.richmond.gov.uk/local_plan, which is also where future updated editions of the IDP and IDS will be published. Planning Obligations and Financial Contributions 26.21 Planning obligations under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), commonly known as S106 Agreements, are a mechanism which make a development proposal acceptable in planning terms, that would not otherwise be acceptable. For planning obligations to be acceptable they must meet three tests set out in Regulation 122 of the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended) which are: Necessary to make the development acceptable in planning terms; Directly related to the development; and Fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the development. 26.22 Therefore, development will be expected to contribute to any additional infrastructure and community needs generated by the development, taking account of the requirements set out in this Plan, the Council's Planning Obligations SPD, Affordable Housing SPD, the Air Quality SPD, Transport SPD, and any relevant forthcoming SPDs, along with the Borough and Mayoral Community Infrastructure Levy.

Not all developments are liable to pay CIL and the borough Community Infrastructure Levy Charging Schedule sets out the rates and boundaries which apply in accordance with the CIL regulations. The current charging zones include a higher residential rate in the north of the borough and a lower rate to the south. A portion of the borough CIL collected is spent on local priorities, this neighbourhood element is operated through the Community Fund. An Infrastructure Funding Statement (IFS) is published each year setting out the income and expenditure relating to the community infrastructure levy (CIL) and section 106 (S106) agreements. The Council will also continue collecting Mayoral CIL which is used by the Mayor and the GLA to fund strategic projects that impact the whole of London, for example Crossrail. Enforcement 26.24 The planning system is undermined when unauthorised development is allowed to go unchecked. Unauthorised development can have a negative impact on the borough’s residents, heritage assets and local areas. The Council will take proactive measure where it has been identified that an unauthorised development causes harm and will take appropriate enforcement action in accordance with the Council’s Planning Enforcement Policy, subject to resources available. Monitoring the Local Plan 26.25 The Council has a well-established and up-to-date monitoring system in place for a range of indicators and targets which monitor the effectiveness of the polices and strategies over time, set out in the Local Plan Monitoring Framework. Key aspects of monitoring continue to be undertaken on an annual basis and is reported as part of the series of Authority’s Monitoring Reports.The GLA also publish monitoring information on the Planning London Datahub which includes interactive tools on development proposals to enable up to date assessment of all planning applications. In addition, the Sustainability Appraisal process, along with other monitoring and research, are used to inform monitoring.The monitoring framework will be revised to reflect the adoption of the new Local Plan policies. 26.26 It is recognised that over the lifetime of the Plan, external circumstances will change. As set out in Policy 10 'New Housing (Strategic Policy) ', the Government annually measures housing delivery and if future delivery falls below certain thresholds then action may be required.Whilst the Plan is overall considered to be flexible, the NPPF allows for Local Plans to be reviewed in whole or in part to respond flexibly to changing circumstances. Therefore, external factors such as changes in national policy, a London Plan review or changes in local evidence and need may trigger a review of this Local Plan. Future reviews may be through a new system of plan-making as proposed by Government through the Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill which may be implemented from late 2024. The programme for the preparation of Development Plan Documents is set out within the Council’s Local Development Scheme, which is regularly reviewed and updated. 379",

BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) – BREEAM is a sustainability assessment and certification scheme for the built environment and provides a widely recognised and well understood framework for the promotion of sustainable design. It allows for the assessment and rating of the environmental life cycle impacts arising from different types of developments, including energy, pollution, water, materials, health and wellbeing, and waste. Compliance with BREEAM will help to mitigate the life cycle impacts of new and existing buildings on the environment and allow developers to demonstrate to the Council that development is truly sustainable. Building of Townscape Merit (BTM) – BTMs are buildings, groups of buildings or structures of historic or architectural interest, which are locally listed due to their considerable local importance. Buildings of Townscape Merits are non-designated heritage assets. Building Regulations (Part L) - Part L (conservation and fuel power) of the Building Regulations in England sets the limiting values for all building fabrics, the conservation of fuel and energy. The Government has said that the Future Homes Standard, anticipated to come into force in 2025, will deliver zero-carbon homes. Part F (ventilation) applies to the ventilation requirements and standard required within buildings. Part O (overheating) requires the calculation and minimisation of overheating within commercial and residential buildings. Often known as TM52 and TM59 overheating analysis requires detailed dynamic simulation thermal modelling (DSM).

Canyon like effect – Created when a narrow street is flanked by continuous tall buildings on both sides. – Capital Asset Value for Amenity Trees (CAVAT) CAVAT provides a methodology for calculating the monetary value and/or compensation where a tree is felled or damaged. It works by calculating a unit value for each square centimetre of tree stem, by extrapolation from the average cost of a range of newly planted trees. This basic value is adjusted to reflect the degree of benefit that the tree provides to the local population. The adjustment is designed to allow the final value to realistically reflect the contribution of the tree to public welfare through tangible and intangible benefits. For further information see the London Tree Officers Association website at www.ltoa.org.uk/resources/cavat Car Club – These are schemes such as city car clubs and carpools, which facilitate vehicle sharing. Carbon - The word carbon is used in this Plan as shorthand for all greenhouse gases. London’s carbon accounting is measured in carbon dioxide equivalent, which includes the conversion of other greenhouse gases into their equivalent carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon Neutral - The definition of a carbon neutral building is a building where greenhouse gas emissions are minimised at all stages, including the manufacturing processes, during construction and during use of the building. The emissions that occur are balanced by climate-positive initiatives and offsetting so that the net carbon footprint over time is zero, making or resulting in no net release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. – Centre Hierarchy The hierarchy of centres in the borough categorises centres and parades into 4 types – town centres, local centres, neighbourhood centres and Important Local Parades.They range significantly in size and function. Paragraph 86 of the NPPF requires local planning authorities to define such a hierarchy. Character – The distinctive or typical quality of a building or area; as described by historic fabric; appearance; townscape; and land uses. Climate Emergency Strategy – A high level strategy intended to provide an overarching framework around climate change, bringing together existing areas of work to provide more clarity and focus, to highlight linkages between approaches being taken across the organisation and to identify additional key future actions and approaches which have not previously been in place. 381",

Dual Aspect – A dual aspect dwelling is one with opening windows on two external walls, which may be on opposite sides of the building or on adjacent sides of a dwelling where the external walls of a dwelling wrap around the corner of a building. One aspect may be towards an external access deck or courtyard, although the layout of the dwelling needs to be carefully considered in these cases to maintain privacy.The design of the dual aspect dwelling should enable passive/natural ventilation across the whole dwelling. The provision of bay windows, stepped frontage, shallow recesses, or projecting facades does not constitute dual aspect. Energy Efficiency - This is about making the best or most efficient use of energy in order to achieve a given output of goods or services, and of comfort and convenience. This does not necessitate the use of less energy, in which respect it differs from the concept of energy conservation. – Energy Hierarchy The Mayor of London's approach to reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the built environment. The first step is to reduce energy demand (be lean), the second step is to supply energy efficiently (be clean) and the third step is use renewable energy (be green). Energy Use Intensity - is a measure of the total energy consumed in a building annually. It includes both regulated (fixed systems for lighting, heating, hot water, air conditioning and mechanical ventilation) and unregulated (cooking and all electrical appliances, and other small power) energy.

Extra Care – Extra Care is housing with care primarily for older people where occupants have specific tenure rights to occupy self-contained dwellings and where they have agreements that cover the provision of care, support, domestic, social, community or other services. This helps people to live independently, avoiding the need to move into a residential care setting. Schemes vary in scale and nature so an assessment will be made on a scheme-by-scheme basis if a proposal is considered as ‘extra care’, depending on the nature of the housing and its design features, the support services available including how care is bought and provided, and any eligibility criteria for tenants or owners. Fabric Energy Efficiency Standard (FEES) – This standard sets a maximum limit on the amount of energy (in kWh/m2/year) that would normally be needed to maintain comfortable internal temperatures in a home. It was first introduced as part of a strategy for zero carbon homes, in 2016. It is included in the Code for Sustainable Homes, a method for assessing and certifying the sustainable design and construction of new homes. Family housing – Family housing is generally defined as having three or more bedrooms, however if of a suitable size (meeting the Nationally Described Space Standard and the external amenity standards) a two-bedroom property can be designed for 3 or 4 persons and would be considered as family housing. Fluvial water – Water in the River Thames and other rivers. Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) – In circumstances where the Environment Agency consider there is a risk of flooding, they may require a Flood Risk Assessment to accompany a planning application. – General Permitted Development Order (GPDO) The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended) grants rights (known as permitted development rights) to carry out certain limited forms of development without the need to make an application for planning permission.

Residential Care – Residential care homes are residential developments where a number of older people live, usually in single rooms, and have access to on-site care services. A home registered simply as a care home will provide personal care only – help with washing, dressing and giving medication. Care homes with nursing provide the same personal care, but also have a qualified nurse on duty twenty-four hours a day to carry out nursing tasks. These homes are for people who are physically or mentally frail or people who need regular attention for a nurse. Homes registered for nursing care may accept people who just have personal care needs but who may need nursing care in the future.

It has representatives from the public sector, business, community, voluntary and faith sectors who harness joint resources to improve the quality of life for everyone who lives in, works in or visits the borough.The Richmond Partnership has an Executive Group which draws together senior members of the Council, Richmond Adult Community College, Richmond Voluntary Services, Police, Fire Brigade, Richmond upon Thames College, Achieving for Children and the South West London Integrated Care System/NHS. For further information, see the Council's website at [www.richmond.gov.uk/richmond_upon_thames_partnership](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/richmond_upon_thames_partnership) Third Generation (3G) playing pitch – A type of artificial grass pitch (AGP) known as 'third generation turf'.With 3G turf, the pile (the artificial grass ‘blades’) is supported by an infill of rubber crumb. Sports that can use 3G pitches include football, rugby and lacrosse, providing that certain specifications are met for each sport. Tidal water – The part of the River Thames that is subject to tides. Town Centres – Centres categorised in the first tier of the borough’s centre hierarchy: Richmond, Twickenham, Teddington, East Sheen, and Whitton. They have an important role to play, providing shops, services, employment opportunities, housing and being a focus for community and cultural life. They are defined on the Policies Map by a Town Centre Boundary (TCB). Transport Assessment (TA) – A comprehensive and systematic process that sets out transport issues relating to a proposed development. It identifies what measures will be required to improve accessibility and safety for all modes of travel, particularly for alternatives to the car such as walking, cycling and public transport and what measures will need to be taken to deal with the anticipated transport impacts of the development. 390",

Transport Statement (TS) – A simplified version of a Transport Assessment where it is agreed the transport issues arising out of development proposals are limited and a full Transport Assessment is not required. Travel Plan – A long-term management strategy for an organisation or site that seeks to deliver sustainable transport objectives through action and is articulated in a document that is regularly reviewed. Tree Preservation Order (TPO) – A tree preservation order is an order made by a local planning authority in respect of trees or woodlands. The principal effect of a TPO is to prohibit the cutting down, uprooting, topping, lopping, wilful damage, or wilful destruction of trees without the LPA's consent. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) – The organisation that seeks to encourage the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage around the world considered to be of outstanding value to humanity. Urban Heat Island Effect – The absorption and retention of heat that results in urban areas becoming warmer at night than rural areas. Use Classes Order – The Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) puts uses of land and buildings into various categories known as 'Use Classes'. Water Framework Directive (WFD) – The WFD is a European directive which aims to protect and improve the water environment (including rivers, lakes, reservoirs, streams, canals, groundwater, transitional waters or estuaries and coastal waters) through a legislative framework. Whole life-cycle carbon - Whole life-cycle carbon emissions are the total greenhouse gas emissions arising from a development over its lifetime, from the emissions associated with raw material extraction, the manufacture and transport of building materials, to installation/ construction, operation, maintenance and eventual material disposal. Zero Carbon (Net-zero Carbon) – Activity that causes no net release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Zero-carbon therefore refers to both embodied energy and operational energy. Embodied energy refers to the energy which is used in the manufacture of the building materials, while operational energy is that which is used to heat, cool and power your home. The embodied energy of insulation, for example, is the energy which is used to create the insulation itself, while good insulation will help towards lowering a home’s operational energy. A building which operates at zero carbon does not burn fossil fuels, has ultra-high energy efficiency and is 100% powered by renewable energy. Zero-emission – Activity that causes no release of air pollutants and carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. 391",

The Council’s assessment will consider the overall length, type and quality of the marketing to come to a view, and if the applicant/agent puts forward any justification for any shortcomings in the marketing (e.g. the use of only one specialist website rather than a range of generic websites due to the nature of the existing employment use, or that a marketing board was not used because of advertisement controls) these will be considered, however the expectation is the below requirements should be fully addressed. 28.3 Marketing should always involve a robust and active marketing campaign and should: Be ongoing for a minimum period as set out in the table below. Be through a commercial agent. The property should be marketed on property databases, search engines and other relevant websites which focus on the sale or letting of commercial premises, which are free to view and easily accessible by prospective purchasers / tenants. Prices should be commensurate with the existing quality and location of the premises.

Applicants should address this when submitting a planning application. Offices (E (g) (i) or (g) (ii) Use Class) 28.9 Where a proposal involves a change of use or redevelopment resulting in a loss of office space, marketing must clearly demonstrate that there is no longer demand for an office based use in this location and that there is not likely to be in the foreseeable future. Marketing must also include the following: Evidence that the site has been marketed for the existing office use and other types of office-based uses such as flexible, start-up or co-working space. Offices should be marketed at a price commensurate with their existing quality or condition based on the local office market, by reference to comparables in the locality. The lease term should not be unduly restrictive and should include the potential for a short-term lease in appropriate cases. Details of the lease terms offered should be included in the marketing report Alternatively, the potential of upgrading the building or adapting the building to meet modern workspace requirements should be explored. This may include a viability assessment addressing the feasibility of refurbishing or modernising the existing office space. 28.10 Please note that provision of marketing will not be accepted as justification for an exception to policy; there should be no net loss of office floorspace.

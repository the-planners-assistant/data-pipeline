We have seen the population in the borough double in the past thirty years and it is predicted to rise by almost 100,000 by 2031. This growth shows that Tower Hamlets is a place people want to live and work in, which we should celebrate, however we need to plan appropriately for this scale of growth. The recent resident survey showed that only 35% of residents felt new housing being built was affordable. This is an issue across the capital but clearly one we have to address in Tower Hamlets. The Local Plan sets out policies on providing the affordable homes we need. The Local Plan also sets out policies about infrastructure provision, employment opportunities and protection of our environment, including air quality. Along with the policies, developments will need to fit within the ambitious vision of the Local Plan – to help continue to build for the kind of borough we want to enjoy in the future. Planning impacts on our everyday lives and influences the character of environment – our borough. It is because of this that we need the guidance to help plan for our future and shape the places we live. Having listened to our local community, here is a Local Plan that reflects their needs and priorities and will help take Tower Hamlets in the right direction.

It identifies how many new homes, jobs and services are needed to support our growing population, and where and how they should be provided. It will also shape how our places will look and feel and influence the way that our communities interact with each other and the spaces around them. It also provides a series of policies to ensure development is well-designed, accessible, safe and respects and enhances the environment, and can be delivered alongside new infrastructure and local services. Tower Hamlets is one of the fastest growing areas in Europe. 1.2 In order to keep pace with this change, this plan has been developed to ensure the benefits of this growth can be spread across the entire borough and also coordinate and manage it in a way that can best meet the needs of our communities. Context The Local Plan has also been prepared in line with the London 1.3 Plan, relevant acts and regulations and the policies set out in the government’s National Planning Policy Framework, with input from local residents, businesses, landowners, neighbouring boroughs, statutory bodies and other interested stakeholders. In particular, it positively responds to the minimum targets for housing and jobs set out in the London Plan [1] . The Local Plan will also sit alongside any future neighbourhood 1.4 plans and area action plans which provide more detailed planning guidance to help shape the development of specific areas and locations in the borough. Together, these documents (along with the London Plan) make up 1.5 the borough’s development plan and will be used to make decisions on planning applications (see Figure 1). This plan must be read as a whole. Proposals will be considered 1.6 against all relevant policies set out in this plan. The policies and proposals set out in this document are also 1.7 illustrated on an interactive map (known as the Policies Map). This map identifies areas of change and opportunity within the borough, as well as the open spaces and other important local assets that will be protected and, where possible, enhanced. It also shows the areas identified in the policies where specific guidance will be followed. 1 The London Plan sets out the overall approach to planning and growth across London, produced by the Greater London Authority on behalf of the Mayor of London. The London Borough of Tower Hamlets Local Plan will be in general conformity with the London Plan. Where relevant, cross-references are made to London Plan and other relevant supporting documents and these will be applied alongside the policies in the Local Plan. 10 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits Part of the borough falls within the boundary of the London 1.8 Legacy Development Corporation (as shown on Figures 2 and 3). The Local Plan does not cover this area with the exception of waste matters (as detailed in chapter 15). Local Plan designations within this area are shown on the Policies Map and key diagram and are identified in the London Legacy Development Corporation Local Plan which applies in this area.

Borough portrait **", "content": "Introduction 2.1 Tower Hamlets has played a significant role in the social, political and economic history of London. Over the centuries, the borough has been a focal point for London and the UK, acting as a key trading route to the east from Central London. Today, Tower Hamlets has grown into a world-class hub for financial, technological and creative industries, with the potential to become the setting for exciting innovations and advances in the twenty-first century. However, this growth has brought with it stresses: Tower 2.2 Hamlets, for example, still has high levels of deprivation and its evergrowing population is placing increasing pressure on local services and resources, including the use of land. Providing enough new homes, jobs and services in the right places to support the needs of our growing population and other parts of London is one of our key challenges. This chapter provides an overview of Tower Hamlets and how it 2.3 relates to the wider London and UK context. It also looks at the future predictions for growth and the implications this will have on local communities and the look and feel of the borough.

{"id": "297796e1-2ec6-46f8-80d1-482be02ac1c2", "title": "**12**", "content": "SECTION 1: SETTING THE SCENE Tower Hamlets is an inner London borough and occupies an 2.4 important strategic location within London and the south east of England (see Figure 2). The borough shares its boundaries with the City of London in the west and the London boroughs of Newham and Hackney in the north. The River Thames flows along the southern boundary of the borough, separating it from the Royal Borough of Greenwich and the London boroughs of Lewisham and Southwark, while the River Lea runs along the eastern fringe of the borough. Part of the borough falls within the boundary of the London 2.5 Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) – the local planning authority that is coordinating the growth and regeneration of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and the wider area as part of the legacy of the Olympic Games (as defined on Figure 3). Any planning application relating to land within this area (including Hackney Wick and Fish Island) must be submitted to the London Legacy Development Corporation. As shown in Figure 2, the borough is extremely well-connected 2.6 with excellent transport links via tube, rail and bus to the City of London, Stratford, Greenwich and other parts of London and beyond, including international airports (e.g. London City Airport and Stansted) and the Channel Tunnel. The borough also forms part of a major growth corridor between London, Stansted and Cambridge, centred on enterprise and innovation within emerging sectors such as digital media, life science, telecommunications and advanced manufacturing. 2 www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/documents/boroughstatistics/population/MYE_2015 3 www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/boroughstatistics/wardprofiles/census 4 https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/daytime-population-borough Population Tower Hamlets has doubled its population in the past 30 years, 2.7 from 150,200 in 1986 to 304,900 in 2016 [2] . From 2006 to 2016, Tower Hamlets witnessed the fastest population growth of any local authority in England and Wales, particularly among the working-age population, making it one of the densely populated boroughs in the UK. 2.8 One of the borough’s defining characteristics is the diversity of its people. Around two-thirds of the borough’s population come from a minority ethnic background and more than two-fifths of the population were born outside of the UK [3] . The borough also has the largest proportion of young people compared to other inner London boroughs. 2.9 The borough’s daytime population has also increased significantly in recent years, primarily as a result of workers travelling to and from the City Fringe and Canary Wharf employment areas, and is approximately 42% larger than its residential population [4] . 14 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**2.

Tower Hamlets continues to play a major role in supporting both 2.11 the London and national economy, contributing significantly to the growth of London as a financial and business centre. The majority of employment is concentrated within the City 2.12 Fringe/Whitechapel and Canary Wharf/Isle of Dogs areas of the borough – these are strategically important employment locations of national and international importance and serve as the headquarters for a large number of multinational businesses. Tower Hamlets also has a very high number of small-to-medium enterprises and micro-businesses, which is characteristic of its role as a seedbed for innovation, creativity and entrepreneurism. However, the benefits of this growth have not been evenly spread across the borough as only 15% of jobs in the borough go to local residents [5] . While there are fewer people who are economically active than 2.13 the regional and national average, levels of education attainment have improved significantly in recent years. Housing In recent years, Tower Hamlets has delivered more homes than 2.14 any other authority in England. However, like many London boroughs, Tower Hamlets suffers from an acute shortage of affordable homes and relative high levels of overcrowding. Over the past decade there has been a marked change in housing 2.15 tenure. Private rented housing is now the fastest growing and largest tenure in the borough. The percentage of social housing has fallen significantly and levels of owner occupation, the smallest tenure, have also slightly fallen. These trends are set to continue. Deprivation and inequality Tower Hamlets is a place of extremes and contrasts. While relative 2.16 poverty in Tower Hamlets has declined, deprivation remains widespread, particularly in central and eastern parts. The borough also has the highest levels of child and pensioner poverty in England [6] . However, there are pockets of affluence within close proximity to the River Thames and former dockland areas. This disparity is reflected in the borough’s ratio of low-to-high pay, which is the largest in London [7] . 2.17 The health of people in Tower Hamlets is significantly worse than the London and England averages, with healthy life expectancy at birth being nearly ten years less than the national average [8] . Health inequalities also persist in the borough, with significant differences in life expectancy between the most and least deprived wards. Physical activity is a major contributor to health and well-being, and levels of physical activity in Tower Hamlets are currently lower than both the London and England averages, with those living in the more deprived areas in the east of the 5 www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/boroughstatistics/economyandbusinesses 6 www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/boroughstatistics/incomepovertyandwelfare/indicesofdeprivation 7 London Poverty Profile (New Policy Institute, 2015) 8 www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthlifeexpectanciesatbirth 16 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits borough being less likely to take part in active sport. Levels of childhood obesity are significantly higher in the borough than the London and England averages, with levels of obesity among 10-and-11-year-olds now increasing. Levels of social isolation and loneliness are also relatively high compared to the England average but similar to London. Environment Figure 4 illustrates that Tower Hamlets is made up of distinct 2.18 places (24 in total) with unique characteristics, from the major international business centres of Canary Wharf and parts of the City Fringe, through to residential areas with traditional East End character, such as Bow and Stepney, and vibrant inner city communities, such as Whitechapel and Shoreditch. Alongside these areas are a number of major leisure attractions and landmarks, such as museums, galleries, markets (e.g. Spitalfields Market), parks (e.g. Victoria Park) and traditional shopping streets (e.g. Roman Road) [9] . These places have evolved from a series of ancient hamlets 2.19 into densely-populated inner-city communities within the heart of east London, encompassing conservation areas, town centres and assets of significant historic and community value, interspersed with open spaces, waterways, streetscapes and views. Steeped in a rich history, Tower Hamlets is blessed with 2.20 substantial areas of historic and architectural interest, including 58 conservation areas (which cover around 30% of its total area) and over 2,000 listed buildings, with great variation in character and size. Some of these buildings are landmarks of national and international importance, including the Tower of London (a UNESCO world heritage site) and Christ Church, Spitalfields. Other notable historic buildings include the medieval parish church of St Dunstan (which predates the Tower of London) and the high-tech, former Financial Times Print Works (constructed in the late SECTION 1: SETTING THE SCENE 1980s). One Canada Square, whilst not formally listed, has been a symbol of modern, progressive London for over a quarter of a century and forms the backdrop to the dramatic skyline of Canary Wharf, which is visible over a wide area. Large parts of the borough (including the former dockland areas 2.21 and part of the City Fringe) have undergone significant change and regeneration, including the refurbishment and restoration of historic buildings along the Thames and within our inner city communities. In recent years there has been an increase in the number of tall buildings, causing notable changes to the borough’s skyline. The greatest natural asset in the borough is the River Thames 2.22 and the network of inland waterways which dissect the borough, such as canals, reservoirs and former working docks (see Figure 5). The borough also has a range of high quality parks and open 2.23 spaces ranging from large urban parks (e.g. Victoria Park, Mudchute Park and Mile End Park) through to burial grounds and small pocket parks. However, the overall provision of publicly accessible open space is low compared to other inner London boroughs with similar characteristics, as well as being far below national standards. The topography and urban form of the borough also makes it vulnerable to the effects of climate change, in particular from flooding and the urban heat island effect. While carbon emissions are steadily falling, the borough still emits 2.24 relatively high levels of carbon dioxide relative to other parts of London, primarily due to emissions from industrial and commercial uses [10] . In addition, parts of the borough, particularly around major roads and junctions, have some of the poorest air quality levels in London. 9 The Tower Hamlets Urban Structure and Characteristic Study identifies the spatial structure of the borough, comprising 24 individual places. 10 UK Local Authority and Regional Carbon Dioxide Emissions: 2005- 2014 (National Statistics, 2016)", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**2.

These areas are shown on the key diagram (see Figure 5). Development will also be focussed in highly accessible locations 7.6 with good links to public transport, cycling and walking networks and town centres in line with policies S.TC1 and S.TR1. 7.7 The remaining part of the borough is defined as the Central sub-area. Whilst not having the status of an opportunity area, this area has the potential to absorb additional growth, primarily through infill and land use intensification which respects the character of the surrounding streetscape. The Local Plan outlines how these areas will look and develop in the future. New development will be expected to have regard to the design and development principles set out in Section 4 and other relevant policies set out in the Local Plan. In particular, these policies will be used as a place-making tool in the development management process to manage growth and deliver associated infrastructure in a coordinated and timely manner in line with the overall vision and objectives of the Local Plan. Each sub-area (as shown on the Policies Map) is distinctive and 7.8 new development will need to respond to their individual characteristics to facilitate distinct neighbourhoods and healthy and liveable places where people want to live, work and enjoy leisure. The Local Plan also seeks to protect and enhance the character 7.9 and distinctiveness of the borough’s 24 places that make up each of the four sub-areas (see Figure 4). Development within the sub-areas will be expected to have regard to the distinct characteristics of the borough’s 24 places, as defined within the Tower Hamlets Urban Structure and Characterisation Study and other relevant guidance, such as conservation area appraisals, design guides, supplementary planning documents and the Tower Hamlets Conservation Strategy. 7.10 Sites have been identified across a range of locations within each of the sub-areas to address the housing and employment needs of the borough as well as facilitate the delivery of key supporting infrastructure, such as publicly accessible open space and schools. These sites (known as allocations) are shown on the Policies Map [11] . Further information on the detailed site-specific requirements that will inform the design, scale and layout of new development within these allocations is set out in Section 4. While the majority of the borough’s future housing and 7.11 employment supply is expected to come forward on allocated sites, significant opportunities exist to bring forward development within other locations, such as small-scale infill sites within existing neighbourhoods and the intensification of existing brownfield sites. These sites (known as windfalls) have the potential to make a significant contribution to the supply of housing and employment land in the borough. 11 Please note – allocations are sites that can deliver over 500 new net additional homes or sites that can provide a significant quantum of employment floorspace and jobs alongside key infrastructure. 34 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits 7.12 Tech City (as identified on Figure 5) is a strategically important business cluster within the heart of the City Fringe sub-area, centred on digital and creative companies, particularly around Shoreditch, Spitalfields and Whitechapel. Whitechapel will also be home to a new state-of-the-art life science research hub (known as Med City) around the existing Queen Mary University campus and Royal London Hospital site alongside residential and commercial uses. This policy seeks to support the continued expansion of this cluster and strengthen the links between bio-tech and life science facilities, including the provision of affordable and shared workspace (see Part 5 above). 7.13 Canary Wharf (as identified on Figure 5) is a financial and business district of national and international importance. The London Plan sets out an aspiration to re-designate Canary Wharf as a metropolitan centre (as defined in the glossary in Appendix 1) due to its potential to serve a wide catchment area over several boroughs and into parts of the wider South East region. Our evidence suggests that Canary Wharf is already fulfilling this role and policies in this plan provide guidelines to help facilitate and support this designation (see Policies S.TC1 and S.EMP1). Town centres are the economic, transport, social and civic hearts 7.14 of our communities and offer the greatest accessibility to jobs, services, shops and public transport. They are relatively vibrant and healthy and many have benefited from growth and investment in recent years. Like many other centres in London, our town centres and high streets face particular challenges in the face of global competition, the internet and fluctuations in the property market; and they need to diversify to attract more people and businesses throughout the day and evening as well as meet changing customer demands. The network and hierarchy of centres is set out in policy S.TC1, with each centre performing a different but complementary role. SECTION 3: POLICIES 7.15 Significant levels of development and resulting population growth will result in the need to deliver a range of facilities, services and infrastructure, such as new schools, open space provision, health facilities and shops. However, much of the borough’s existing infrastructure is at or close to full capacity and in many cases requires investment. Developers are therefore expected to contribute towards meeting the additional infrastructure needs arising from new development. Further details (including the mechanisms through which developers will be expected to contribute towards infrastructure provision) are outlined in Policy D.SG5, Section 4 (relating to site allocations) and Section 5 (relating to the monitoring and delivery framework). This policy will be implemented through a number of mechanisms 7.16 such as supplementary planning guidance, master plans and opportunity area frameworks, which provide more detailed guidance to coordinate and manage development alongside the London Plan.", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**7.

It seeks to ensure each individual development positively contributes to implementing and delivering the vision and objectives of the plan. For the purposes of this policy, we will consider the application 7.18 and design in its entirety and in relation to its surroundings. Impacts will be considered unacceptable when they do not meet the standards and requirements provided in the policies in the plan or where they result in negative impacts that cannot be adequately mitigated. Improving health and wellbeing in the borough is a key priority in 7.19 our Community Plan, reflecting the borough’s significantly high levels of poor health outcomes. This policy seeks to address high levels of poor health in the borough, which environmental improvements, including the principles of active travel, active design and healthy streets, can help to reduce [12] . The design of the built environment and the provision of 7.20 accessible services are able to directly contribute to reducing inequalities (including health inequalities) and promoting community cohesion. This policy addresses these objectives and helps to ensure the continued delivery of ‘One Tower Hamlets’ via the built environment and development process. Planning has a particular role to play in ensuring the built environment is accessible to those with physical impairments and this is addressed in part b.vi above. In order to demonstrate compliance, developments will be expected to provide details within the planning application statement, identifying how they have met the principles outlined above. 12 Further details on the borough’s health profile and priorities and the links between health and the built environment can be found in the Tower Hamlets Joint Strategic Needs Assessment: Planning and Health (2016) and the Tower Hamlets Health and Wellbeing Strategy (2017). 36 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**7.

Developments containing those uses which are most likely to impact health outcomes, or are in locations which may impact on health outcomes, are required to undertake a health impact assessment. Health impact assessments should be undertaken using the 7.22 recommended guidance from our public health service. For example, the latest Healthy Urban Planning Checklist which also provides a rapid health impact assessment tool (Healthy Urban Development Unit). Part 1 refers to major developments in areas of sub-standard 7.23 air quality: these are areas where nitrogen dioxide levels exceed 40 µg/ m3 (the European Union legal limit / national air quality objectives). This includes areas in which fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels exceed 10 μg/m3 annual mean PM2.5 (World Health Organisation guideline limits). These areas are outlined on the Policies Map. Part 2 states that developments of a scale referable to the 7.24 Greater London Authority (as defined in the glossary in Appendix 1) will be expected to complete a more extensive health impact assessment. Further guidance on how these assessments should be undertaken will be available from our public health service. A health impact assessment can also be submitted as part of an integrated impact assessment. The health impact assessment should outline how the 7.25 development could positively or negatively impact on the wider determinants of health and should identify actions to enhance the positive impacts and mitigate the negative impacts. The outcome of these actions should be clearly identifiable within the planning application. 38 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES Explanation This policy recognises that the high levels of growth within the 7.26 borough are mainly taking place alongside, or within, areas which are already densely inhabited. It therefore seeks to ensure development minimises its impact on the local environment and existing communities. Developers will be expected to sign up to the considerate 7.27 constructors scheme and a constructors forum (where appropriate) to better manage and mitigate the cumulative impacts arising from construction on the borough’s key development sites. The Considerate Constructors Scheme is a national initiative 7.28 which seeks to promote safe and considerate building practice and engineering works and improve standards of neighbourliness. Sites that are registered under the scheme are independently assessed and monitored against a code of considerate practice, designed to encourage higher standards of conduct. We may also consider membership of alternative constructor schemes as also meeting the requirements of this policy. Further detail on implementing Part 1(a) is provided in Control of 7.29 Dust and Emissions Supplementary Planning Guidance (GLA, 2014). Compliance with Part 1(b) should be evidenced within an air 7.30 quality (dust) management plan, using the methodology, measures and monitoring process outlined in the Control of Dust and Emissions Supplementary Planning Guidance. In order to demonstrate compliance with Part 1(c) and (d), where appropriate, a construction logistics plan should be submitted in line with relevant Transport for London guidance. In addition, applicants may wish to submit proof of membership of the fleet operator recognition scheme and/or direct vision standard for heavy goods vehicles.", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**7.

This should be evidenced through the construction logistics management plan. Further guidance on producing a construction logistics management plan can be found in the Sustainable Design and Construction Supplementary Planning Guidance and our latest code of construction practice. We seek to reduce development waste and encourage the 7.32 process of limiting waste to begin early in site development. The design and materials used in the construction of new buildings (including the need to choose sustainable materials and sustainable construction methods) can make a significant difference to the energy requirements and associated level of carbon emissions. In order to address Part 3 of the policy, applicants should evidence how the development will meet this requirement in the design and access statement and/ or the sustainability statement, as part of the planning application. More detailed guidance can be found in the Sustainable Design and Construction Supplementary Planning Guidance. 40 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES Explanation In order to ensure that the policies of the Local Plan are 7.33 delivered in a way that achieves sustainable development, we will seek contributions from developers to fund improvements to infrastructure and the environment. Contributions will be made through the Community Infrastructure Levy (which applies a standard charge to developers to fund supporting infrastructure such as transport, schools, community facilities and health centres) and/or Section 106 agreements (which address the provision of affordable housing and more site-specific infrastructure requirements). The spatial vision and objectives emphasise the importance 7.34 of managing growth and shaping change. This puts planning for infrastructure at the heart of the Local Plan, ensuring that new development in the borough contributes towards the provision of the infrastructure that is needed to support growth and enable everyone in the borough to benefit from the opportunities this will bring. Developer contributions can help to contribute to the success of 7.35 a development and the needs of the wide community in line with the key priorities set out in Sections 2 and 4. For instance, they can enhance the quality of a development and ensure it does not give rise to unacceptable development impacts. We will work collaboratively with our partners to deliver the 7.36 infrastructure necessary to support the growth and development identified within the Local Plan, understanding the contribution that this growth can make to achieve the wider objectives of the plan and other relevant strategies. The Infrastructure Delivery Plan identifies the types of infrastructure required to support the anticipated growth in the borough and includes a summary of the currently identified infrastructure projects is included in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan.

The borough-wide Community Infrastructure Levy (which was 7.38 adopted in April 2015) will be used to deliver infrastructure in line with the Regulation 123 List, which sets out the projects or types of infrastructure we intend will (or may) be wholly or partly funded through this levy. Necessary items required to mitigate the impact of development that are not on the Regulation 123 List, such as affordable housing, may be secured through Section 106 obligations. The Mayor of London’s Community Infrastructure Levy will help 7.39 fund strategic transport projects (e.g. Crossrail 2). We collect these receipts from developments in Tower Hamlets and pass them onto Transport for London. Developments in the borough may be liable for both the Mayoral and borough-wide community infrastructure levy and, in certain circumstances, pursuant to supplementary planning guidance, the Mayor of London may also require a Section 106 financial contribution from office, retail and hotel developments. Part 1(b) seeks to address the use of Section 106 planning 7.40 obligations to secure the provision of affordable housing and mitigate the impact of development where these cannot be addressed through the Community Infrastructure Levy. Section 106 planning obligations will be sought where they are: a. necessary to make the development acceptable in planning terms b. directly related to the development, and c. fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the development. The Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document 7.41 provides detailed guidance on our approach to planning obligations. The measures sought through a planning obligation will vary depending on the nature and scale of a development, its location and impacts. Development which is subject to a Section 106 agreement should apply this document, and will be assessed on an individual basis. 7.42 Financial contributions may be sought financially or ‘in kind’ – where the developer builds or directly provides the matters necessary to fulfil the obligation negotiated as part of the planning application. Where provision is made within developments, this will be credited to the scheme and may offset financial contributions that may otherwise be sought. However, financial contributions may be secured for reasonable fitting out and infrastructure costs and this is determined on a case-bycase basis. Part 1(c) aims to ensure developers maximise contributions 7.43 towards the delivery of affordable housing and infrastructure in line with the vision and objectives of the plan, whilst still ensuring development can be delivered. Development should follow the guidance set out in the Development Viability Supplementary Planning Document. This sets out how the Local Plan policies should be applied in a development viability context when determining planning applications. It aims to provide greater clarity to both applicants and the general public and ensure that the principles of sustainable development are at the forefront of decision-making in Tower Hamlets. 42 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES Financial viability is a key consideration in terms of the application 7.44 of Section 106 planning obligations, and where development does not meet planning policy or propose to provide required planning obligations, financial viability assessments are required to be submitted in accordance with the prevailing local validation requirements checklist or any relevant supplementary planning document. The issue of financial viability should be considered at the earliest opportunity. If an applicant is engaged with us in this regard prior to the submission of a planning application, then the chances of a positive outcome for all sides are greatly increased. 7.45 Part 2 seeks to provide flexibility in the determination of planning applications relating to the site allocations (as outlined in Section 4) to ensure that development is viable and can be delivered during the plan period, having regard to the provision of infrastructure and other site specific requirements set out in the plan. Part 3 sets out our approach to the application of the vacant 7.46 building credit, which provides an incentive for brownfield development on sites containing vacant buildings. Viability evidence finds there is no need to apply the vacant building credit mechanism in the borough to ‘kick start’ development [13] . In addition, the effect of the vacant building credit will be to reduce affordable housing contributions and this is contrary to our need to deliver affordable housing through the planning system [14] . The Affordable Housing and Viability Supplementary Planning Guidance (GLA, 2017) sets out the extent to which vacant building credit should be applied in London and concludes that its application is unlikely to be suitable in London. 13 Tower Hamlets Local Plan Viability Assessment (2017) 14 Tower Hamlets Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2017)", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**7.

Creating attractive and ** **distinctive places**", "content": "Introduction The borough consists of a number of distinctive, diverse and 8.1 vibrant places, such as historic hamlets, ancient markets, urban parks, inland docks, urban farms and a world heritage site. Together, the characteristics of these places make up the distinct identity of the borough, and have evolved gradually over many years. More recently, the pace and scale of growth within the borough and across London has threatened the fabric of these unique places. The policies in this chapter seek to ensure that new development 8.2 is well-designed, safe, accessible, inclusive and respects the distinctive character of our places, paying careful attention to the layout, scale and form of buildings and spaces, the connections between them, and the mitigation of impacts, such as noise and air pollution. This section contains the following policies: 8.3 z Policy S.DH1: Delivering high quality design z Policy D.DH2: Attractive streets, spaces and public realm z Policy S.DH3: Heritage and the historic environment z Policy D.DH4: Shaping and managing views z Policy S.DH5: World heritage sites z Policy D.DH6: Tall buildings z Policy D.DH7: Density z Policy D.DH8: Amenity z Policy D.DH9: Shopfronts z Policy D.DH10: Advertisements, hoardings and signage. 44 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits Explanation Delivering high quality design will help to ensure that Tower 8.4 Hamlets remains one of the most dynamic and attractive parts of London. We are seeking to achieve excellence in the quality of our buildings and spaces which befit Tower Hamlets’ location within the heart of London and its world-class urban environment. The purpose of this policy is to outline the key elements of high quality design so that we create buildings, spaces and places that are sustainable, accessible, attractive, durable and well-integrated into their surroundings and that are sensitive to the character of the area, thus contributing to a better quality of life. The character and places of the borough are described in more 8.5 detail in Section 2 (Setting the scene) and Section 4 (Delivering placemaking) of the plan and other relevant studies (e.g. Tower Hamlets Urban Structure and Characterisation Study). Parts 1(a) to (c) provide detailed guidance to ensure that the 8.6 design, siting and layout of new development is considered in the wider context and is sensitive to the existing character and identity of the area, taking account of the opportunities to improve health and well-being. Part 1(d) refers to views which are locally distinctive and which 8.7 residents, workers and visitors of the borough recognise and value. In particular, development proposals will need to take account of the views identified in Policy D.DH4 and shown on Figure 6. Part 1(e) seeks to ensure that new development (including 8.8 materials and finish) is designed and built as robustly and durably as possible to support its users and reduce the need to make additional alterations following construction, particularly where it is associated with family living, social housing and specialist accommodation. Planning applications (including temporary permissions) will need to include technical information regarding materials and finishes to demonstrate their longevity, quality and relationship to the local context. SECTION 3: POLICIES Part 1(f) seeks to ensure that buildings and spaces are designed 8.9 to be convenient for a wide range of users, including wheelchair users, elderly people with reduced mobility and families with young children. Buildings and spaces should be designed to be adaptable and flexible from the outset, enabling them to respond to the changing needs and lifestyles of the occupier and allow for a variety of uses over time. Part 1(g) will be considered against the objectives set out in the 8.10 Tower Hamlets Local Biodiversity Action Plan in line with Policy D.ES3. Part 1(h) highlights the importance of integrated sustainable 8.11 solutions to managing climate change and maximising opportunities to make more efficient and prudent use of energy and waste in line with Policies S.SG2 and D.SG4. Part 1(i) seeks to promote the provision of open spaces and water 8.12 spaces in the borough and recognises their importance for the health and well-being of the local community as well as their contribution to biodiversity and landscape, as set out in Part 1(g).", "level": 2, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**8.

As Tower Hamlets has some of the highest population densities 8.14 in London, the quality of our streets and spaces is important to maintain and create a high quality of life. The public realm in the borough varies considerably, from the high quality treatments around Canary Wharf (e.g. natural stone paving and tree planting) and conservation areas, through to the isolated, post-war streetscapes beyond Canary Wharf and Aldgate, as well as the severance arising from major arterial routes (e.g. East Cross Route, Aspen Way and The Highway) around Bow, Poplar, Limehouse and the Tower of London. Part 1 seeks to improve connectivity, permeability and legibility, 8.15 especially around key transport interchanges, town centres and community hubs around the borough, whilst maintaining existing routes through or adjacent to development sites to allow continued access during the construction of development. Connectivity refers to the number of connections and their 8.16 integration, layout and relationship to one another and the impact this has when moving from one point to another. Permeability refers to the variety of pleasant, convenient, accessible and safe routes through an area and the capacity of those routes to carry the movement of people, whilst avoiding visual clutter in the streetscape and barriers to pedestrian/cycle movement as much as possible. Legibility is the degree to which a place can be easily understood and moved around in and can be called ‘way-finding’. SECTION 3: POLICIES In order to improve accessibility and increase movement, new 8.17 development will also be required to follow a street hierarchy that puts pedestrians and cyclists first and promotes streets as links for movement and as places in their own right to ensure a strategic, accessible and safe street network across the borough. This hierarchy consists of: a. Main streets – focusing on movement and prioritising the safe and convenient flow of buses, cyclists and pedestrians b. Secondary streets – balancing movement between vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians, with attractive and convenient places where people gather c. Local streets – protecting and enhancing the character and social gathering function that streets provide, alongside their function of providing safe and convenient access to individual properties. In addition, Part 1 seeks to embed the principles of secured 8.18 by design into the design and layout of new development. Developers should refer to the relevant guidance in relation to counter-terrorist and crime prevention security and engage fully in the pre-application process in order to ensure that measures to mitigate risks are incorporated into developments, where appropriate. Where there is a need to ensure the safety of streets and public spaces, particularly crowded places, the correct level of protection should be provided without compromising the ability to create aesthetic and functional public spaces. Proposals should not impose undue restrictions on other occupiers in the area. Part 2 places public realm as a central component to the design of 8.19 a development to ensure it is comfortable and functional, well-integrated with surrounding areas (including London’s green grid network) and supports the delivery of successful and vibrant places.", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**8.

Proposals should also use complementary elements, such as 8.21 materials, finishes, furniture, landscaping, signage, lighting and public art, to ensure that development and the public realm is at a human scale and puts people at the heart of the design process, so that the importance of how people view and feel about their environment is recognised. This should include ensuring design features meet the health and well-being needs of people (e.g. the provision of shade, shelter and places to rest, including seating with supportive backs). Development should aim to ensure building frontages are active 8.22 and minimise visual and physical obstruction and street clutter. Refuse and recycling facilities should be sensitively and conveniently located so that they are easily accessible by residents and operatives.

Tower Hamlets has a higher proportion of scheduled monuments, 8.26 listed buildings and conservation areas compared to that of other London boroughs. Some of the key elements of the borough’s heritage include: SECTION 3: POLICIES In order to satisfy the criteria set out in Parts 2 to 9, developments 8.29 will need to demonstrate an understanding of the significance of the relevant asset, including the contribution setting makes to its significance, as part of the planning application process. It should also include an assessment of group value, as well as the individual significance of heritage assets. As a minimum, this should include both desktop analysis and on-site investigation, with reference to the Greater London Historic Environment Record and other relevant documentation. The borough has a local history library, which provides a useful resource. Research undertaken into the heritage asset affected should describe the significance of the heritage asset in sufficient detail to determine its historic, archaeological, architectural or artistic interest to a level proportionate to its importance. The Greater London Historic Environment Record will help inform whether a site on which development is proposed includes or has the potential to include heritage assets with archaeological interest. Detailed plans to an appropriate level will need to be submitted 8.30 with applications as part of design and access statements/heritage statements to demonstrate how the heritage asset and its setting will be impacted and to ensure that its significance is protected or enhanced. Where a new heritage asset is discovered, the developer will be 8.31 expected to work with us to seek a solution that protects the significance of the new discovery, so far as is practicable within the existing scheme. Depending on the importance of the discovery, modifications to the scheme being implemented may be required. a. Military and naval buildings (e.g. Tower of London) b.

We will not permit harm to or total loss of a designated heritage asset unless the benefits of the proposal outweigh the harm or the criteria set out in Part 4 can be met. In particular, listed buildings and structures in the borough make 8.33 an important and valued contribution to the character and appearance of the borough and provide places to live and work in, well-known visitor attractions and cherished local landmarks. We have a duty to preserve and maintain these assets for present and future generations. Proposals relating to works to a listed building or within the 8.34 vicinity of a listed building will be required to demonstrate that it will not affect the special interest of the listed building. In addition to planning permission, listed building consent may also be required for works that will affect the special character of a listed building. When considering proposals within conservation areas, as set 8.35 out in Part 6, consideration will be given to the relative significance of the element affected and its contribution to the significance of the conservation area as a whole and its setting. We have prepared a series of conservation area appraisals 8.36 and management plans that assess and evaluate the character and appearance of each of our conservation areas and set out how we consider they can be preserved or enhanced. We will take these into account when assessing planning applications for development in conservation areas. We will seek to manage change in a way that retains the distinctive character and appearance of our conservation areas and will expect new development to contribute positively to this. In relation to Part 9, any development in or adjacent to 8.37 archaeological priority areas is required to investigate and consider any archeological interests in the area. The archaeology of the borough can best be protected if as much information as possible is available at the planning application stage. The evaluation, which may involve fieldwork, is needed so that we can assess the archaeological implications of proposals. Where appropriate, the evaluation may show how developments can be designed so that they do not harm a site of archeological interest and/or how the remains will be preserved at the site, and where appropriate, preserve the archaeological findings at the site.

Townscape views can be valued for a variety of reasons, but often the most valued views will feature a prominent building that terminates a vista, acts a focal point or establishes some other form of spatial prominence. Such landmarks help to define and identify places and are considered to be a key component of high quality urban design. The policy identifies: a. A skyline of strategic importance which is observed from multiple locations within and outside the borough, and b. A series of views and landmarks of a borough-wide importance: borough-designated views and borough-designated landmarks. 8.44 Part 1(a) refers to strategic views identified in the latest versions of the London View Management Framework and Tower of London and Maritime Greenwich World Heritage Site Management Plans which have impacts on developments within Tower Hamlets. Part 1(b) refers to the group of tall buildings around Canary Wharf 8.45 that form a distinctive cluster, referred to as the ‘skyline of strategic importance’. This cluster is visible across London and has become a globally recognised silhouette. The distinctive skyline of the cluster is a prominent and recognisable feature in views from the surrounding areas, which are of a much smaller scale. The area of skyline of strategic importance covers the tall building zones in Canary Wharf: Canary Wharf cluster and the Millwall Inner Dock cluster, as shown on the Policies Map and set out in Policy D.DH6. Building heights within the designation area should significantly step down towards its boundaries. The heights in the setting of the skyline of strategic importance should be consistent and significantly lower than the buildings at the edge of the designation area. Development should be tested in the views as per Figure 6. Part 1(c) refers to borough designated landmarks – buildings of 8.46 high architectural and cultural value that can be seen in views to and from a number of conservation areas. These views are referred to as borough designated views. Development should be tested against their impact on the prominence of borough designated landmarks in borough designated views as per Figure 6. 8.47 Intrusive development (as defined in the glossary in Appendix 1) that competes with the prominence of borough-designated landmarks in the backdrop of the borough-designated views or obscures them at the mid or foreground will be resisted. New developments are expected to make a positive contribution to the skyline, including in their use of palette and texture, in particular where these buildings will have an impact on long-distance views. Part 1(d) seeks to shape and manage the impact of development 8.48 on views identified in the Conservation Area Character Appraisals and Management Guidelines covering each of the borough’s 58 conservation areas. Development that is harmful to the special character of these views will be resisted. Part 1(e) recognises that water space is an intrinsic element of 8.49 the borough’s identity and that its presence is an essential element of the character of a place. Visual connections between public realm and waterfronts should 8.50 be strengthened. Developments located directly at the waterfront and on streets in their direct vicinity which are parallel and perpendicular to their course should afford views and glimpses of waterscape from the street level. 54 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES Part 1(f) seeks to shape and manage the impact that development 8.51 would have on townscape and local views that are important to the identity of Tower Hamlets and its unique places. These will be identified on a case by case basis through the townscape and visual impact analysis in relation to a particular development. Due to relatively flat topography, tall buildings located in the borough can be seen from a number of remote locations.

London has four world heritage sites, two of which are located 8.53 within or next to the borough of Tower Hamlets on the banks of the River Thames: the Tower of London and Maritime Greenwich (as shown on Figure 5). The Tower of London, one of the UK’s most famous landmarks 8.54 and tourist attractions, is a Grade I listed castle and royal fortress, which acts as the gateway into the borough from the west. Indeed, the borough is named after the villages and hamlets around the Tower of London. However, many of the streets and spaces in and around this area are dominated by vehicles/heavy traffic and offer a poor public realm and interchange experience from Tower Hill and Tower Gateway stations. These issues are also identified within the Tower of London World Heritage Site Management Plan. Maritime Greenwich lies immediately south of the borough and 8.55 comprises an ensemble of buildings (including the Queen’s House, Royal Observatory and the Old Royal Naval College) set in landscaped parkland (part of the buffer area lies within the borough at Island Gardens on the Isle of Dogs, as shown on Figure 6). This policy aims to ensure that new development safeguards and 8.56 does not negatively impact on the ‘outstanding universal value’ of the Tower of London and Maritime Greenwich world heritage sites, including their attributes, settings and views to and from them. In this context, outstanding universal value is defined as “areas of cultural and/or national significance so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations of all humanity” [15] . 15 United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).

In recent years there has been a surge in the number of tall building developments in the borough, particularly within existing clusters at Aldgate, Isle of Dogs and other clusters emerging along the River Thames waterfront. Whilst tall buildings can positively contribute to the local 8.60 environment and help to deliver growth in the local economy or much needed new homes, they can also cause harm to the character and identity of an area, either individually or cumulatively. 8.61 Tall buildings can significantly impact the quality and safety of the public realm (e.g. through blank facades and a poor street interface or through generating adverse micro-climatic conditions, such as wind funnelling). They may cause overshadowing or solar glare and undermine the quality and value of adjacent developments. In low-or-medium rise residential neighbourhoods, tall buildings can feel overbearing and have a negative impact on amenity and views. Beyond the Central Activities Zone and Tower Hamlets Activity 8.62 Areas, as defined on the Policies Map, the borough is largely residential in nature and includes a relatively high proportion of medium to low rise buildings. In this context, it is important that tall building developments are 8.63 carefully designed and steered towards locations that positively respond to the context and character of the surrounding area, including the borough’s 24 places. SECTION 3: POLICIES 8.64 For the purposes of this policy, a tall building is classified as any building that is significantly taller than its local context and/or has a significant impact on the skyline. Within the borough, buildings of more than 30 metres, or those which are more than twice the height of surrounding buildings (whichever is less) will be considered to be a tall building. Part 1 of the policy sets out the criteria against which all 8.65 development involving tall buildings will be assessed. The criteria will guide the visual and contextual development of tall buildings in the borough. In order to enable assessment against the criteria, we will require an accurate visual representation to be submitted alongside the design and access statement as part of the planning application. This model should show the proposal in near, middle and distant views, including the public realm and its appearance at street level. It should include a 360-degree view analysis and a study of relative heights of buildings in the surrounding area. A virtual model and/or visual impact study (including verified views) may be required depending on the scale and nature of the proposal, including an assessment of the cumulative impact of nearby proposals with valid planning permission. Proposals involving tall buildings will need to demonstrate how 8.66 any adverse impacts on the microclimate will be mitigated in relation to wind, overshadowing, day lighting, solar glare and light pollution. Buildings over 30 metres in height and/or substantially taller than the surrounding area and/or over 150 units must be tested against the industry standard Lawson criteria in relation to wind. The testing of the following scenarios will be required as part of the planning application: a. Baseline (i.e. the situation at the time of submission) b. The proposed development without mitigation/landscaping c. The development with surrounding cumulative developments without mitigation/landscaping d. The development with the inclusion of mitigation/landscaping", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**8.

The development with surrounding cumulative developments with the 8.70 Part 2 identifies a series of tall building zones (as shown on the Policies Map and Figure 7) to make it clear where tall buildings will be directed. The location of these zones has been derived from a thorough analysis of the character of the borough. The Tall Buildings Study should be read alongside this policy and 8.71 provides detailed guidance on the potential location, design and height of tall buildings in the borough. It is expected that a new supplementary planning document will be prepared (as a follow-up to the Tall Buildings Study) to explain how the policies relating to tall buildings and other high density developments in the plan will be implemented. 8.72 Each tall building zone is different and tall buildings proposed within the zones will need to respect the existing character of the area and respond to sensitivities. Tall building development within the zones may require land assembly as not every individual plot within these zones is large enough to meet requirements set out in Part 2. inclusion of mitigation/landscaping f. Specific details on the required mitigation measures must be provided, including where and how these measures will be implemented g. It is essential that any required mitigation measures are tested as part of the application. This is to ensure that the mitigation is adequate, and can therefore be relied upon. The mitigation must be implemented prior to occupation of any part of the development and retained for the duration of the development. Proposals involving buildings 90 metres in height or greater 8.67 must be referred to the Civil Aviation Authority and London City Airport to ensure they will not be a potential hazard to aviation safety and navigation, in view of the proximity to London City Airport. The criteria set out in Part 1 also applies to the redevelopment 8.68 of existing tall buildings (including those outside the tall building zones). The presence of an existing tall building on the site will not in itself be regarded as justification for replacing it with another tall building or the commencement of a tall building cluster or zone. Tall buildings, by default, house large numbers of people and 8.69 can support a range of activities, including the provision of amenity areas (e.g. private, communal and public spaces) and active uses. In the majority of cases, tall buildings are communities in their own right. Tall buildings should deliver appropriate quantities of high quality amenity and play space (where residential uses are proposed) which is exclusive to tenants and occupants. Communal spaces should establish platforms for interactions between users to support a sense of belonging. Ground floors of tall buildings, where possible, should introduce uses which would benefit the wider neighbourhood. Tall buildings should also foster social cohesion and support integration between local communities. 62 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES Figure 8: Principles of tall building clusters Within tall building zones (as shown on Figure 7), clusters of tall 8.73 buildings may be developed. The height of tall buildings within a cluster should reflect the role and function of the cluster and normally the tallest elements should be located towards the centre of the cluster, which should mark a particular feature or location (e.g. One Canada Square, Canary Wharf). Developments involving tall buildings will be required to step down towards the edge of the tall building zone (see Figure 8). It does not follow, however, that all buildings within a tall buildings zone will be tall in height/scale and variations in height will be encouraged to create a more dynamic skyline. Proposals involving tall buildings on the edge or within the vicinity 8.74 of tall building zones will be expected to follow the step down approach from the cluster and demonstrate how they will avoid the merging of clusters and be sensitive to the height of the surrounding context. Building heights in the adjacent tall building zone will not be considered to set a precedent for inappropriate heights on adjoining sites. In the context of this policy, step down sets out how the transition in height takes place in both character and physical form. The Tall Buildings Study identifies other potentially suitable locations outside of the tall building zones where tall buildings might be appropriate, depending on the nature of the proposals and where sensitive receptors have been addressed. However, tall buildings will generally not be supported in sensitive locations (e.g. conservation areas). 64 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES In relation to Part 3 (a) to (d), tall building proposals outside of 8.75 the zones will be subject to additional criteria to make sure they are focussed in appropriate locations (e.g. areas of high public transport accessibility) and contribute positively to the character of the site and surrounding area. In such locations, tall buildings will be expected to serve as landmarks and unlock strategic infrastructure provision (specific examples include publicly accessible open space, new transport interchanges, river crossings and educational and health facilities serving more than the immediate local area) to address existing deficiencies and future needs (as identified in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan, the Regulation 123 List and other relevant strategies and in the requirements set out in Section 4). The height of these buildings should relate to their role as a local, district or metropolitan landmark and the surrounding context height (as categorised in the Tall Buildings Study). In addition, proposals should ensure that there is adequate distance between the proposed and existing tall buildings in the area to ensure that the positive aspects of the existing local character and legibility are maintained and/ or enhanced. Where possible, we will seek to work with developers, land 8.76 owners, statutory agencies and neighbourhoods to develop masterplans to guide the scale and location of tall buildings, taking account of their wider and cumulative impacts, in line with the requirements set out above.

In addition, developers should consider the existing and planned capacity of infrastructure and services to accommodate the development, including potential mitigation measures to provide additional capacity and unlock any identified constraints. Where residential density guidelines are applied to mixed-use 8.81 developments, the density figures should be based on the net residential area. Developers are expected to reference in their planning application the relevant London Plan density guidance for their site and the actual net residential density proposed. Tall and dense developments are also required to consider the 8.82 criteria set out in Policy D.DH6 (taking account of the guidance set out in the Tall Buildings Study). Explanation Many proposed developments in the borough are seeking to 8.77 exceed the highest density levels currently set out in the London Plan’s density range. While, in principle, this is allowed as an exception as part of the London Plan’s policies, in some parts of the borough, exceptional densities are coming forward in great numbers and concentrated in certain areas, such as South Quay and parts of the City Fringe Central Activities Zone. In order to manage this, the policy requires that developments in 8.78 excess of the London Plan density levels should consider the cumulative effects from development including the development potential of neighbouring sites. In particular, it seeks to optimise the use of land in the wider area and ensure development takes place in a coordinated manner with neighbouring sites as part of the masterplanning exercise to prevent it from constraining the ability of neighbouring sites to optimise densities. For the purposes of this policy, mitigation may be required to 8.79 address any negative impacts resulting from a level of development that is excessive in terms of demand on infrastructure and services, or impact on local amenity and character. 66 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES Explanation This policy seeks to ensure developments are well designed (both 8.83 internally and externally) and enable residents and occupants to enjoy a good level of amenity and natural surveillance. 8.84 For the purposes of this policy, a habitable room is defined as a room within a dwelling, the primary use of which is for living, sleeping or dining. This definition includes living rooms, dining rooms, bedrooms, studies, home offices and conservatories but excludes halls, corridors, bathrooms and lavatories. Kitchens which provide space for dining and have windows will be considered habitable rooms and should be included in the assessment of amenity impacts. Applicants or developers will need to give careful consideration to 8.85 the layout and massing of buildings to ensure that the new development does not result in an increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook. Single aspect dwellings should be avoided. If dwellings overlook bin stores, then screening and landscaping should be used to limit the impact. 8.86 Part 1(a) of the policy seeks to ensure there is sufficient privacy and no unreasonable loss of amenity from overlooking between habitable rooms of adjacent residential properties, or onto schools and other community facilities (e.g. health centres) or private open spaces. The degree of overlooking depends on the distance and the horizontal and vertical angles of view. However, a distance of approximately 18 metres between windows of habitable rooms reduces inter-visibility to a degree acceptable to most people. This figure will be applied as a guideline depending upon the design and layout of the development. 8.87 For the purposes of this policy, outlook is defined as the visual amenity enjoyed by occupants when looking out of their windows or from their garden, see Part 1(b).", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**8.

Part 1(d) seeks to ensure that new developments minimise the impact of the loss of daylight and sunlight and unacceptable overshadowing (including on amenity space and public open space). A sunlight and daylight assessment must accompany all major 8.89 planning applications and/or smaller schemes where adverse effects on daylight and sunlight levels are anticipated. It should follow the methodology set out in the most recent version of Building Research Establishment’s ‘site layout planning for daylight and sunlight’ guidance and the British Standard Code of Practice for daylighting, the results of which must be submitted with the planning application. Daylight and sunlight assessments should also include consideration of the potential redevelopment of adjacent sites, so as not to prejudice their redevelopment, see Part 1(d). 8.90 Part 1(e) seeks to ensure that artificial lighting is well-designed and uses appropriate light levels to avoid interference with someone’s use of their property and reflects the street hierarchy. Badly designed lighting schemes can be damaging to the environment and result in visual nuisance to residents. 8.91 For the purposes of this policy, light pollution is defined as the adverse effect of artificial lighting and includes glare, light spillage and sky glow. Odour and fumes from commercial development can also have an 8.92 adverse impact on the amenity of surrounding residents. Best practice guidance should be followed: development should refer to the most upto-date guidance and/or best practice on the control of odour and noise from commercial kitchen exhaust systems. Noise and dust pollution can often be a particular problem during 8.93 the construction phase of the development. Where necessary, we will use planning conditions requiring construction management plans to demonstrate that noise and dust pollution can be satisfactory managed and/or mitigated along with any adverse impacts on the highway network. 68 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits Explanation This policy seeks to ensure that shopfronts are attractive, well 8.94 designed and make a positive contribution to the surrounding streets, spaces and public realm and thereby enhance the overall character and appearance of the borough. Shopfront design should be an integral part of the design process 8.95 with consideration given to how security measures are incorporated to maintain active frontages at all times. These should include the use of security glass and internal retractable grills rather than the use of closed external roller shutters which result in unwelcoming environments. SECTION 3: POLICIES 8.96 Shopfronts should incorporate a well-defined frame, stall-riser, door and window units which sit in a defined architectural surround, use appropriate high quality materials and be of a scale which relates to the upper floors of the building and complements the quality and character of surrounding buildings. Achieving a sensitive relationship between the shopfront and its 8.97 surroundings means for instance: shopfront fascias should be within the width of a single building and should not extend above the ground floor or obscure architectural features of value. Shopfronts which form part of a group of original shopfronts and/ 8.98 or are designated heritage assets should be of a traditional design and incorporate traditional features, character and use traditional materials.

Part 1 provides guidance on the appropriate design and settings 8.100 of advertisements, hoardings and signage (including fascia and hanging shop signs, A-boards, poster panels, digital billboards and free-standing advertisements). We recognise that well-designed features in the streetscape can 8.101 make a positive contribution to the public realm and play an important role in providing local information and supporting local businesses. However, poorly designed, excessive or overly dominant features can have negative impacts on the character and appearance of their surroundings and can create hazards for pedestrians and traffic. Advertisements, hoardings and signage should be in keeping with 8.102 the character of the area and should not negatively affect the amenity of surrounding properties or highway/public safety. There is a particular need to avoid physical and visual clutter in the streetscape as well as problems arising from distraction among road and pedestrian users. For instance, the location of A boards in areas where the width of the footway is less than 2 metres will be resisted. Poster panels/freestanding adverts will generally be out of place within residential areas due to their scale, size and intrusive nature. External illumination for signage will need to be carefully considered at an early stage in the design process to ensure that lighting can be sensitively incorporated, where required.

Meeting housing needs**", "content": "Introduction This chapter sets out the policies to maximise the supply of 9.1 housing in the borough to meet both local and strategic needs. 9.2 The London Plan (GLA, 2016) identifies a ten-year minimum housing supply target of 39,314 homes within Tower Hamlets over the period 2015-2025. This is equivalent to a minimum requirement of 3,931 homes per annum. The London Plan does not set out specific housing targets beyond 2025 but expects boroughs to ‘roll forward’ their annual target. The London Plan ten-year target, plus the annual rolled forward target, results in a housing supply target for the borough (2016 – 2031) of 58,965 homes. This target is greater than our objectively assessed need of 9.3 46,458 homes [17] , reflecting the fact that the borough is expected to significantly contribute towards meeting London’s strategic housing need. Appendix 7 sets out a summary of the expected housing supply over the plan period. Tower Hamlets also needs to provide at least 21,100 new 9.4 affordable homes over the same period to meet its future needs, equivalent to an average of 1,407 dwellings per year (45% of the overall need). The delivery and implementation section sets out the strategy 9.5 on how we are planning to meet both local housing needs and strategic housing needs over the plan period (see Section 5). SECTION 3: POLICIES 9.6 The figures in Table 1 are based on the estimated capacity of the four sub-areas (further detail on these figures is set out in Appendix 7).

In addition, we anticipate that through normal plan delivery over 9.9 the plan period, sufficient additional units can be delivered to meet the London Plan target. This is due to factors relating to uncertainties and assumptions in the housing supply which have not been factored into the trajectory (see Appendix 7) and are anticipated to accelerate the delivery of new homes over the plan period. This includes higher-than-average density levels and delivery rates (due to the extent of development interest in the borough) and the emergence of new delivery mechanisms (e.g. new council-led housing companies and the GLA-funded housing zone within Poplar Riverside) and other interventions (e.g. brownfield register). If our targets are not being met, we will undertake an update of 9.10 the Local Plan to explore ways of addressing this unmet need, taking into account the outcomes of future revisions to the London Plan and opportunities to increase the supply of housing as detailed in Section 5 below. Triggers and timescales for an update are outlined in Section 5. This section contains the following policies: 9.11 z Policy S.H1: Meeting housing needs z Policy D.H2: Affordable housing and housing mix z Policy D.H3: Housing standards and quality z Policy D.H4: Specialist housing z Policy D.H5: Gypsies and travellers accommodation z Policy D.H6: Student housing z Policy D.H7: Housing with shared facilities (houses in multiple occupation). 19 Our approach in this regard is outlined in the Tower Hamlets Housing Delivery Strategy (see also 9.14). 74 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**9.

The borough’s housing supply target relates to total net housing 9.13 supply. The strategic target is composed of the housing supply target of at least 39,310 new homes between 2015 and 2025 – established in the London Plan (GLA, 2016) – and a rolled-forward target of at least 3,931 new homes per year between 2026 and 2031. The target includes self-contained residential units and non-self-contained residential accommodation, including specialist housing for students and older people in use classes C2, C3 and C4 or sui generis, as identified in Annex 4 of the London Plan (GLA, 2016). Housing growth will be primarily delivered in the locations 9.14 specified in Part 1(a) [20] via a number of different mechanisms: the regeneration of previously developed land, intensification of the built form in opportunity areas, and in highly accessible locations along transport corridors, and the delivery of site allocations. Sites which form part of the Poplar Riverside Housing Zone programme are also expected to support the delivery of new homes. A smaller proportion of housing will be delivered through town centre intensification, estate regeneration and infill development, bringing back long term vacant properties into residential use and the development of windfall sites. Further details can be found in Sections 4 and 5 [21] . SECTION 3: POLICIES Part 1(b) seeks to protect existing and safeguard the future supply 9.15 of self-contained housing. This is to ensure we meet identified local need as well as strategic targets for housing. Development for non-selfcontained units will not be supported where it utilises land identified for self-contained housing through a current planning permission, or through the borough’s development plan. It is recognised that other policies in this plan identify suitable locations for other land uses. Developments of other land uses, where supported by policy and/or site allocations, are not considered to undermine the supply of self-contained units. Family housing requires particular protection, due to high levels of identified need [22] . Part 1(c) and (d) will be implemented through partnership working 9.16 to realise local need as well as strategic targets. Estate regeneration schemes are expected to protect and enhance the estate’s physical environment and community assets, as well as deliver at least likefor-like replacement of unit size and tenure mix. The Tower Hamlets Housing Strategy (2016-2020) and the Good Practice Guide to Estate Regeneration (GLA, 2018) provide further guidance. Policy D.H2 (Part 5) provides further detail on delivering this requirement. Vacant units brought back into residential use also contribute 9.17 towards meeting the housing supply figure. We undertake a range of activities to bring vacant buildings back into use, such as grants and buy back of ex-council stock. 20 Opportunity areas are designated in the London Plan (GLA, 2016) and are considered to be London’s main opportunities for accommodating large-scale new development to provide substantial numbers of new employment and housing, due to transport connectivity, land availability and deliverability. Site allocations are sites in the borough which have been identified as able to accommodate new homes and jobs alongside necessary infrastructure such as open space, health and education facilities. Further information about opportunity areas and site allocations are provided in Policy S.SG1. 21 The Housing Delivery Strategy sets out our approach to managing housing delivery across the borough to 2031 and supports the delivery of the housing target set out in this plan. 22 Tower Hamlets Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2014 and 2017)", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**9.

There is a concern at a regional level that a portion of new build homes in London are not being used in a way which meets housing need and GLA-commissioned research indicates that Tower Hamlets has the second highest percentage of overseas sales in London [23] . Developers are encouraged to make a voluntary ‘first dibs’ offer to the Mayor of London or participate in any replacement initiative which encourages the marketing of new homes for sale to Londoners in the first instance and/or provides Londoners with an opportunity to purchase new homes before they are marketed overseas – particularly lower cost homes. 9.19 Part 2 sets a target of achieving 50% affordable homes through private development as well as council-led initiatives. This target is . On developments that considered to best reflect local housing need [24] yield 10 or more net additional residential units, at least 35% affordable housing is expected. Developments are expected to maximise the provision of affordable housing, having regard to availability of public subsidy, implications of phased development (including provision for re-appraising scheme viability at different stages of development) as well as financial viability which should, in particular, take account of prevailing local and regional viability guidance. Applicants are strongly encouraged to meet or exceed the delivery of 35% affordable housing. Lower levels will only be accepted where robustly justified through viability evidence and where it is demonstrated that there are clear barriers to delivery. Applications that do not meet policy requirements will be subject to viability re-appraisals. Further guidance is provided in the Development Viability Supplementary Planning Document and the Viability and Affordable Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (GLA, 2017). The borough’s guidance will take precedence. 9.20 Affordable housing calculations will be made using habitable rooms. Given the extent of local need, it is considered necessary and 9.21 appropriate to seek financial contributions towards the provision of affordable housing from sites of less than 10 units. Financial contributions will be calculated using our preferred methodology as set out in the Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document. Over the plan period, developments on small sites have the potential to contribute over 3,000 new homes and could make a significant contribution towards meeting local affordable housing need (see Appendix 7). Financial contributions will be calculated using a slidingscale target starting at 3.5% across the whole site and increasing by 3.5% for each additional home, reaching 35% for sites of 10 units or more. Further detail (including on financial viability assessments) is provided in the developer contributions policy (D.SG5) and in the latest Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document. Part 2(b) expects that all housing developments will contribute 9.22 to delivering mixed and balanced communities. Private student and specialist housing will be required to deliver a mix of affordable and market units of the relevant typology on site in order to meet a wide range of needs. All other housing development will be required to deliver a mix of housing tenures and sizes on site. Part 2(c) seeks to support a range of innovative housing products 9.23 such as ‘build-to-rent’ private rented housing. Housing products will be supported where they are compatible with optimising the use of land and facilitate the delivery of housing to meet needs in each tenure. All residential developments, excluding student and specialist housing (which are addressed in Policies D.H6 and D.H4 respectively), must meet the requirements outlined in Policies D.H2 and D.H3, including unit size mix, affordable housing and space standards. In addressing these 23 Overseas Investors in London’s New Build Housing Market (University of York, 2017) 24 This need is established in the Tower Hamlets Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2014 and 2017). 78 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits requirements, consideration will be given to the size of the development. We also support the delivery of residential moorings in suitable locations (further guidance is provided in Policies S.OWS2 and D.OWS4). Part 2(d) demonstrates our commitment to supporting those who 9.24 wish to build their own home. The current self-build register indicates there is interest in self-build in the borough, however high local land values and housing targets are resulting in the predominance of flatted developments which limits opportunities for viable self-build. Group self-build has the best potential to deliver significant additional housing output in higher cost areas, like Tower Hamlets [25] . We would therefore encourage group self-build as a more viable model of self-build in the borough. Our housing service is working with interested local selfbuilders to support self-builders overcome challenges to delivery in the borough. Part 3 requires development proposals to appropriately respond 9.25 to the character of the surrounding area and site-specific constraints, as well as provide a high quality living environment taking account of the Home Quality Mark standards [26] . Further guidance is provided in chapter 2. Part 4 recognises our duty to provide specialist and supported 9.26 housing for students, gypsies and travellers, the homeless, the disabled, vulnerable and older people. This will be achieved through working with partners to facilitate the appropriate quantity and quality of housing. In addition, specialist housing should be integrated into the wider area through careful design and the sharing/joint use of facilities to encourage a sense of community belonging and social interaction, where applicable. SECTION 3: POLICIES The existing gypsy and traveller site at Old Willow Close (as shown 9.27 on the Policies Map) has been safeguarded to meet the borough’s gypsy and traveller accommodation need. We will also seek to deliver and safeguard any further pitches which may be provided adjacent to the existing site, following completion of the Elizabeth line construction [27] . 25 London Strategic Housing Market Assessment (GLA, 2013) 26 The Home Quality Mark is a new residential quality design and construction standard, developed by the Building Research Establishment. 27 This need is identified in the Tower Hamlets Gypsy and Traveller Needs Assessment. The safeguarded site meets our statutory requirement to ensure adequate provision of sites to meet the needs of gypsies and travellers who meet the new government definition of gypsies, travellers and travelling showpeople (Policy for Traveller Sites, Department for Communities and Local Government, 2015). Any additional capacity on the site and adjacent land will contribute towards providing culturally appropriate housing for gypsies and travellers who do not meet the new planning policy definition.", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**9.

In addition, we face considerable challenges in delivering homes which are affordable to local people on average-to-medium incomes, who are unable to access social housing or afford market housing, particularly if they have children [28] . The policy seeks to ensure new housing maintains mixed, 9.29 balanced and stable communities across the borough and delivers the right range of housing products to meet locally assessed needs. As outlined in Part 2(a), affordable housing calculations including the percentage of affordable homes delivered in a scheme, the percentage of intermediate and affordable rented homes and any calculation undertaken in relation to assessing Part 2(b) will be calculated using habitable rooms. 9.30 Where the development provides up to 35% affordable housing, as per Policy S.H1 above, the affordable housing provision should be comprised of: SECTION 3: POLICIES Larger intermediate units (three or more bedrooms) should 9.31 be prioritised as London Living Rent products, and generally, shared ownership will not be considered appropriate where unrestricted market values of a unit exceed £600,000 (as per the Affordable Housing and Viability Supplementary Planning Guidance [GLA, 2016]). Where the development provides more than 35% affordable housing, the tenure of the additional affordable homes will be subject to negotiation. GLA developed products (including the London Affordable Rent and London Living Rent) may be subject to change over the plan period. Our affordable housing service will provide further guidance on suitable products when assessing applications. Rent levels are determined as part of the viability assessment of each planning application and undertakings are made to retain similar rent levels at the point of completion. The ownership of affordable homes must be transferred to one of our approved local registered providers or other approved affordable housing providers. 9.32 Part 2(a) requires proposals to calculate affordable housing using habitable rooms as it ensures the provision of a range of housing sizes more likely to meet the needs identified in the latest housing needs assessment. It is expected that there should not be a greater than 5% variation in floorspace between the private and affordable units, excluding units designed for wheelchair use. This prevents an underprovision of affordable housing where the developer proposes unusually large market homes. 9.33 In the majority of cases, affordable housing should be delivered on-site. This is important in promoting mixed and balanced communities. In some circumstances, site constraints may lead to applicants proposing to provide affordable housing off-site or through payments in-lieu to contribute to the delivery of affordable housing and in particular rented family housing. a. 70% rented element, of which 50% should be London affordable rents and 50% should be Tower Hamlets living rent b. 30% intermediate element, which can include London living rent, shared ownership and other intermediate products [29] . 28 These needs have been identified through the Tower Hamlets Strategic Housing Market Assessment, which sets out the housing requirements arising from expected population growth. 29 Further guidance is provided in the Approval to Proceed with Guidance on New Rent Levels (2017)", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**9.

Part 2(a) and (b) gives further guidance. In addition, the design of the off-site development, the living environment for residents and other elements of the scheme must demonstrate advantages to residents over the option of affordable housing provided on-site. 9.35 If no suitable sites are available for off-site affordable housing and payment in-lieu is to be acceptable, developers must demonstrate that the payment will enable the construction or purchase of a minimum of 50% affordable housing in the borough and there is no financial advantage to the development of not providing affordable housing onsite. This must be evidenced through the financial viability statement. The payment in-lieu will be ring-fenced for additional affordable housing output. Part 2(d) refers to incremental development. This is housing 9.36 development where permission is subsequently amended (e.g. by means of a variation of the extant planning permission) to the extent that the amended development would provide new units or the existing development is extended to provide new units by the granting of a new permission on the same or an adjoining site where the units would physically or functionally extend the existing development (e.g. by relying on a common access core or on the existing amenity space or other communal facilities in order to meet the policy requirements or standards required elsewhere in the plan). In these circumstances, we consider the new units to be part of the existing development and the affordable housing requirements will be calculated accordingly, taking into account the affordable housing already delivered or secured. In both cases, where the amended or linked development would provide 10 units or more in aggregate, affordable housing should be provided, in accordance with The use of the fast track threshold approach where the unit mix 9.38 and affordable housing product split is not being met must be confirmed as acceptable by our affordable housing team. Policy S.H1, Part 2 (a)(iii) and Parts 1 and 2 (a) to (c) above. If it would result in less than 10 new units in aggregate, policy S.H1, Part 2 (a)(ii) will apply. If lower than policy compliant levels of affordable housing for the total scheme (as amended or extended) are proposed, this will only be accepted where robustly justified through a financial viability assessment, in line with the latest guidance (as outlined in paragraph 9.18). The financial viability information should be proportionate to the scale of change and time elapsed between the existing approval or development and the proposed amendment or extension. Part 3 requires proposals to provide a range of unit sizes. Unit 9.37 size distribution will be calculated by unit numbers and not habitable rooms. Developments may be required to meet updated needs as a result of monitoring. Where a development proposes to deliver at least 35% affordable housing (to use the fast track approach) and in exceptional circumstances (e.g. where applications propose to deliver a significantly higher quantum of affordable housing than 35%, whilst meeting the required affordable housing tenure mix, and/or propose to deliver significant social infrastructure on-site), we will consider a different housing mix, having regard to the following factors: a. The proposal must meet the tenure split requirements outlined in Part 1. b. Proposals will be expected to meet our affordable housing product requirements outlined in paragraphs 9.29 and 9.30. c. Greater unit mix flexibility can be applied to the market tenure unit mix, as opposed to the unit mix for affordable housing. However, the scheme must still provide a significant proportion of family housing in the market tenure and proposals will be expected to meet our unit mix requirements to deliver family housing in the affordable tenures. 82 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits In view of the high housing target and the shortage of family 9.39 housing in the borough, Part 4 seeks to ensure that priority family housing is not unnecessarily lost through development. In order to manage the current shortage of family homes (three or more bedrooms), proposals to convert family homes into smaller self-contained flats will be resisted, unless the conversion enables the retention of a family unit. The continued access to a private garden for the family unit, where applicable, is considered to be appropriate due to the shortage of traditional forms of family housing within the borough. Conversion to residential uses identified as hostels or other forms of shared accommodation (including homes for multiple occupation) will also be resisted. Housing estates in the borough provide a large number of 9.40 affordable homes, as well as much valued open space and community facilities. Part 5 recognises the importance of retaining these facilities and the existing quantum of affordable housing. Where it would result in an improvement in quantity and quality of open space or community facilities, re-provision will be allowed. Affordable units must be reprovided with the same or equivalent rent levels. This policy also recognises that additional homes may be provided through estate regeneration schemes and seeks to secure that any net additional homes are also subject to the affordable housing requirements in Policies S.H1 (Part 2) and D.H2 (see Parts 1 and 2). Part 5(d) ensures that there is a plan in place to bring any existing homes retained as part of an estate regeneration scheme up to the latest decent homes standards, either during the regeneration works or through a planned maintenance and/or major works programme. SECTION 3: POLICIES Part 6 seeks to ensure that residents, businesses and other 9.41 stakeholders are able to properly influence and shape the proposed development at the earliest opportunity, helping to better deliver sustainable communities. This is particularly important due to the levels of development taking place in the borough alongside existing communities. The Tower Hamlets Statement of Community Involvement should be used as best practice guidance to inform the types of consultation and co-production methods which proposed developments and estate regeneration schemes are expected to undertake in accordance with the consultation and engagement principles outlined in the Good Practice Guide to Estate Regeneration (GLA, 2016), or any replacement document. Consultation must be undertaken in advance of submitting a planning application. The consultation statement will be required at planning application validation stage.", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**9.

Achieving the borough’s high housing target will result in further intensification of land use and therefore require an appropriately quality-driven response to maintain and improve standards of living in the borough. High density developments necessitate that development delivers higher than the minimum design, space and amenity standards. Part 1(a) and (b) seeks to ensure all housing development 9.43 provides adequate internal space to meet relevant space, accessibility and amenity standards and provide an appropriate living environment. It requires development to comply, as a minimum, with the space and accessibility standards set out in the London Plan (GLA, 2016) and the Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (GLA, 2016), whilst having regard to the particular needs of residents in the borough as well as the increasingly dense character of the built form. If the GLA’s space and accessibility standards are updated, we may seek to implement these changes, so long as they are locally suitable. We strongly urge developers/applicants to provide evidence of how the scheme will achieve high quality design in line with the Home Quality Mark standards. In order to implement Part 1(b) and meet standards in the Housing 9.44 Supplementary Planning Guidance (GLA, 2016), 10% of all new units across all tenures should be wheelchair user dwellings, but this may be varied to at least 10% of habitable rooms where a better outcome is provided in terms of delivery of larger units. All ‘wheelchair user dwellings’ (the M4 (3) standard) in the affordable rented tenure should meet the M4 (3) (2) (b) standard which meets the needs of occupants who use wheelchairs. It is expected that units which meet the wheelchair user dwellings standards M4 (3) (2) (b) above the ground floor will be provided with access to a second lift for use when the primary lift is not SECTION 3: POLICIES functioning. We have a preference that units which meet the accessible units standards M4 (3) will be provided below the fifth floor due to . In difficulties allocating wheelchair accessible units on higher floors [30] some circumstances, site constraints (such as the inability to secure sufficient accessible parking, lack of lift circulation space and restrictions on ground floor residential uses) could lead to applicants arguing that units which meet the wheelchair user dwellings standards M4 (3) (2) (b) may not be able to be delivered on site. In these circumstances, we may accept payments in lieu of the provision of units which meet the wheelchair user dwellings standards M4 (3) (2) (b) through the ‘Project-120’ scheme [31] . 9.45 Part 2 provides guidance that private and affordable housing should not be distinguishable. Different tenures should be mixed throughout a development, although it is recognised that separate cores may be required to enable effective management and minimise service charges for affordable units. Where separate cores result in separate entrances for market and affordable units, these entrances must also not be externally distinguishable and must be located so that they are of equivalent access and amenity value. Part 3 recognises that due to higher occupancy rates and child 9.46 yields, affordable housing is likely to be subject to more wear and tear than other housing tenures. In order for these homes to be fully fit for purpose, developers must use hard-wearing, durable materials to ensure the development remains of high quality throughout its lifetime and requires minimal service charges to clean and maintain. This should be evidenced in the design and access statement. In addition, all familysized affordable homes should have separate kitchens and living rooms, due to local needs. For further guidance, please contact our affordable housing service and/or refer to the Tower Hamlets Housing Forum’s Section 106 Design Guide. 30 Accessible Housing Assessment (2018) 31 We are working with the borough’s development partners to ensure that new homes for wheelchair users are designed to meet the specific needs of families on the accessible housing register and thereby reduce the number of tenants requiring specifically adapted wheelchair accessible homes and the length of time they have been waiting to secure a suitable home.", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**9.

Part 5 seeks the provision of new outdoor amenity space on-site which is well located, well designed and functional (including private amenity space, communal amenity space and child play space) to provide opportunities for residents to lead healthy and active lifestyles. In considering the design and layout of private amenity space, it 9.48 is important that the space meets the minimum standards set out in the policy (see Part 5) to ensure that residents have sufficient space to carry out activities such as drying clothes or eating a meal outside. In relevant areas, developments should also be guided by Policies D.ES2 (Air quality) and D.ES9 (Noise and vibration) in relation to the layout and design of amenity space. Due to the positive impacts of access to nature in terms of 9.49 well-being, a significant amount of amenity space should include soft landscaping. This also provides greater opportunity to incorporate biodiversity elements and sustainable urban drainage systems. In considering the design and layout of communal space, it is important that this space is integrated into the overall design of the development and the wider public realm. The design should ensure that communal space is overlooked and supports a range of activities including space for relaxation, gardening, urban agriculture and opportunities to promote biodiversity, ecology and intergenerational community cohesion. In considering the design and layout of child play space, it is 9.50 important to ensure that this responds to the needs of children within the development. Play space for all children should be provided on site. Where there are demonstrable site constraints, play space for under fiveyear-olds must be on site and older children’s play space must be within . This space should be the GLA’s specified recommended distances [32] well-integrated into the development and fully considered in the design of the communal space. However, play provision requirements must be provided in addition to other quantitative standards, such as open space provision and communal space provision. In order to demonstrate that the proposed play space is of high quality, applicants will be required to demonstrate within the health impact assessment how they have used Play England’s 10 key design principles for creating successful play spaces.

It also seeks to protect appropriate staff accommodation ancillary to a relevant use. The Tower Hamlets Housing Strategy (2016-2021) seeks to 9.52 create more choice so that development meets a wide range of housing needs. The London Plan (GLA, 2016) provides an indicative benchmark for specialist housing for older people. The benchmark for Tower Hamlets is 70 units a year, of which 45 units should be an affordable product. Examples of specialist housing include: 9.53 a. Sheltered housing – commonly self-contained homes with limited on site support (usually within use class C3) b. Residential care homes – commonly bedsit rooms with shared care is provided for those residents who need it (also within use class C2); e. extra-care homes – combinations of the above providing independent lounges and eating arrangements (within use class C2) c. Nursing homes – similar to residential care, but accommodating ill or frail elderly people, and staffed by qualified nursing staff (also within use class C2) d. Dual-registered care homes – residential care homes where nursing living alongside care and support, and sometimes also offering support for older people in the wider community f. staff accommodation ancillary to a relevant use. Development proposals will need to submit details of how they 9.54 meet the requirements set out in Part 2 (a) to (d) and/or the need for specialist housing set out in Part 3 (a) to (d), as appropriate.

In addition, new development must demonstrate that it is 9.56 accessible in terms of location and individual mobility needs. Close proximity to local services is considered to be a walkable distance of no more than 10 to 15 minutes. Where appropriate, the proposed scheme should provide necessary storage for mobility scooters. In addition, opportunities to integrate the development into the wider area should also be explored to encourage a sense of belonging (especially among people from different generations) as well as to protect against loneliness and isolation. Part 3 also ensures that specialist housing contributes to mixed 9.57 and balanced communities. Older persons’ housing will be required to be delivered across tenures in accordance with the latest Tower Hamlets Strategic Housing Market Assessment. It is expected that all specialist housing in use class C3 will provide affordable homes, in line with Policies S.H1 and D.H2.

However, the delivery of a significant amount of student housing may compromise our ability to deliver other priorities, including self-contained housing, employment and infrastructure provision. As such, the delivery of student accommodation needs to be managed in accordance with strategic needs and local priorities. In the context of this policy, student housing relates to private 9.62 student accommodation, student accommodation with an undertaking with an institution and accommodation provided by an institution. Appropriate locations predominately consist of a dense urban grain where the introduction of student housing could potentially complement the existing mix of uses and the provision of local services, including public transport. Close proximity is defined as adjacent to the institution or within walkable distance of 10 to 15 minutes. Policy S.TR1 provides greater detail on accessible locations. Proposals involving the development of student housing must 9.63 demonstrate that it will not involve the net loss of existing self-contained homes and/or will not involve land identified for self-contained housing through a current planning permission or through a site allocation set out in the borough’s development plan. In order to meet the needs of students with physical disabilities, 9.64 5% of student rooms must be wheelchair accessible (capable of being independently accessed and used). To meet this requirement, rooms and bathrooms must meet the requirements outlined in Figure 30 and Figure 52 in the British Standard BS8300: Design of an accessible and inclusive built environment. 90 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES 9.65 Part 1(a) supports the delivery of affordable student housing in accordance with the London Plan (GLA, 2016). We will use the Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (GLA, 2016) to negotiate the proportion of affordable housing, its cost and its allocation to students (an indication of the level of rent and the proportion of affordable housing will be provided through the London Plan annual monitoring report). This suggests that the cost should be no more than 55% of average student income for a UK full-time student living in London away from home, and suggests that the proportion of affordable housing should be the maximum reasonable amount, subject to viability. Planning obligations will be used to secure the affordability and availability of the affordable accommodation for as long as the student housing use continues. Part 1(b) to (c) seek to ensure the suitability of the 9.66 accommodation in terms of its relationship with the surrounding environment and in terms of living standards. Development will be required to demonstrate how it meets these criteria. There are concerns regarding an over-concentration of student housing in some areas which may have an impact on the amenity of existing residents. The issues relate to noise disturbance or the loss of shops and services that meet the needs of longer term residents. We will therefore assess proposals for student housing having regard to any existing concentrations and the wider housing mix in the area. Where the scale or concentration of student housing is likely to harm the amenity of the local area and undermine the balance of housing and service provision, we will seek a range of mitigation measures, such as management conditions and additional infrastructure provision. Part 2 relates to proposals involving the net loss of student 9.67 accommodation. The loss of student accommodation should not create additional pressure on the existing housing stock and the supply of new housing, and thus it will only be supported where it can be demonstrated that it no longer serves a purpose or can be provided elsewhere.", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**9.

Planning permission is required for a HMO where there are more than six unrelated individuals forming a household who share a kitchen, bathroom or toilet. This definition is different to that used by the mandatory licencing scheme. HMOs have traditionally provided lower cost housing, including for those under 35 years of age in receipt of the shared room rate housing benefit. However, there has been a recent growth in London of purpose-built, large-scale, higher quality HMOs charging commercial market rents [35] . This includes, for example, accommodation modelled on student housing but available for a wider range of occupants or accommodation described as ‘co-living’. The Greater London Authority (GLA) household projections 9.69 suggest there is an increasing demand for HMO-style accommodation in the borough, particularly among young people. The number of ‘other type’ households (which includes HMOs) headed by persons aged 1634 is projected to rise from 12,295 in 2016 to 16,555 in 2031 [36] . High quality, large-scale HMOs can help meet this need. This will need to be demonstrated with regards to the specific scheme and location (Part a). Applications should seek to address housing need, as outlined in Policies S.H1 (see paragraph 9.21) and D.H2. It is considered this is best delivered through a mixed tenure scheme which could meet a range of housing needs. In addition reflecting the changing role of HMO-style accommodation in the borough and the acute shortage of affordable housing, it is appropriate that all forms of market housing (including HMOs) contribute towards meeting the high affordable housing need. 35 Making the most of build to rent (Future of London, 2017) 36 Tower Hamlets Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2017) 92 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES Part 1(a), (b) and (c) ensures development contributes towards 9.70 maintaining mixed and balanced communities. Our affordable housing service – using the evidence from the latest strategic housing market assessment – will assess the proposed rent levels to determine whether the development would primarily provide housing with shared facilities for people with low incomes. Where it would not meet the housing needs of those on low incomes, developments will be required to meet the affordable housing requirements outlined in Policies S.H1 and D.H2. Affordable housing contributions will be sought from all residential developments (as per the GLA’s Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance). The high-density nature of HMO development means that they 9.71 should be provided in sustainable locations and must demonstrate they will not create adverse amenity impacts to the immediate and/ or surrounding residential area. In order to address this, HMOs should be found in locations which have suitable transport and which will not cause amenity impacts to the surrounding area. Where appropriate, we will seek a planning obligation to protect local amenity (e.g. by securing a management plan). HMO developments must provide high quality living space, in line 9.72 with relevant standards as outlined in Policies D.H3 and D.DH8.

The west of the borough forms part of the Central Activities Zone (see Figure 10) which contains London’s core functions and activities, such as government administration, culture and business. Canary Wharf, located to the north of the Isle of Dogs, contains some of the world’s largest financial and professional service organisations. The borough has a proud history of entrepreneurialism amongst 10.2 local people, with businesses ranging from small family companies, creatives, start-ups, light manufacturers and small-to-medium enterprises, through to multinational corporations. There has also been a growth in hi-tech and creative industries over the last few years, as well as businesses moving from more central parts of London to take advantage of lower rents. Employment space has, however, come under increasing development pressure and legislative changes have broadened the scope of permitted development without full planning applications. Industrial land in particular has been lost at a faster rate than originally planned, creating a shortage that could undermine the ability of the borough and the key international business locations of Canary Wharf and the City of London to function effectively. Alongside this, there has been a shift in the type of employment space that employers and start-ups require. This pressure has meant that it is not just availability but also affordability of employment space that has become an issue, thus threatening the business-focused dynamism of local people and the borough’s industrial heritage. 37 https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/long-term-labour-market-projections The total number of jobs in the borough is projected to rise from 10.3 285,600 in 2015 to 410,600 in 2031, an increase of 44% (125,000 jobs), . This is based on by some way the highest growth figure in London [37] previous growth trends being maintained into the future; between 2005 and 2015 there was a comparable jobs increase of 47%. In terms of projected jobs in office and industrial sectors, we have used forecast data from Experian Economics. This identifies a growth of 36,481 employment jobs in the borough over the plan period. Table 2 sets out these forecasts along with estimates of the net additional floorspace that would be required to support these jobs. 10.4 The table demonstrate that there is sufficient supply of sites identified for future office floorspace. There is however a shortfall of industrial floorspace compared to demand as a result of significant losses of industrial land in the borough in recent years and the displacement of businesses into the borough from the City of London and other inner London boroughs where they have been forced out by higher rents and land values. As such, it is vital that existing provision is protected and that new floorspace is encouraged in appropriate locations to service the needs of industry as well as the needs of the City Fringe and Canary Wharf. 94 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES Table 2: Jobs and floorspace (sqm) forecasts: 2015-2030 |Col1|Demand|Col3|Col4|Supply|Balance| ||||||| |||Net|Gross||| ||Jobs|Floorspace|||| |Office|35,716|435,879|729,136|1,369,225|+640,089| |Industrial|765|36,366|273,912|82,376|-191,536| 10.5 While the industrial projections cannot be met from identified sites in the development pipeline, potential additional capacity exists within designated employment locations through the intensification of existing provision.

These are illustrated on the Policies Map.| |Other employment sites|These are sites or units outside of the areas described above. Cumulatively, they provide significant floorspace and jobs across a variety of sectors.| 98 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits Explanation This policy sets out our approach to employment provision in 10.8 relation to the level and distribution of jobs across the borough over the period to 2031. This will help to ensure successful and sustainable local and sub-regional economies, promoting and facilitating a range of employment spaces to meet the needs of different types of occupiers across different locations (see Figure 10 and the Policies Map). We will work with applicants during the pre-application process 10.9 to ensure that proposals are consistent with the needs and character of their locations, while addressing policies set out elsewhere within this section and the wider Local Plan. 10.10 Additional office floorspace forms a substantial element of the borough’s future employment projections. Canary Wharf and the City Fringe contain a high proportion of primary and large floorplate offices which form part of globally-significant employment clusters. As such, these areas need to be protected and supported to ensure the delivery of sufficient high quality employment land to meet borough-wide needs. This will be achieved through the designation of Preferred Office Locations (POLs) [38] . SECTION 3: POLICIES The Central Activities Zone (CAZ) and the north of the Isle of Dogs 10.11 (including Canary Wharf) has been subdivided into three distinct areas [39] . Commercial core areas (Primary POL) are deemed to be unsuitable locations for housing or other uses which would undermine the strategic functions of the CAZ and the north of the Isle of Dogs [40] . Employment and defined strategic functions/uses must be given greater weight than residential (Secondary POL) or equal weight to residential use (tertiary areas within the CAZ). 10.12 Part 1 of the policy identifies the borough’s Primary POL which corresponds with the ‘commercial core area’ of the north of the Isle of Dogs. This area has a high concentration of significant office functions, with high levels of activity and accessibility to London and the wider region. The Secondary POL covers parts of the City Fringe and north 10.13 of the Isle of Dogs. These areas are also key existing or potential employment locations with offices and other strategic functions as the dominant land use. However, in contrast to the Primary POL, residential uses will be acceptable so long as they do not undermine the supply of offices and other strategic uses. This approach seeks to ensure residential development does not prejudice the future intensification of employment floorspace or undermine the predominant employment function of these areas. This will help achieve a sensitive transition between the Primary POL and surrounding areas. 38 Source: Preferred Office Location Boundary Review (2017). 39 Further details are provided in the Central Activities Zone Supplementary Planning Guidance (GLA, 2016). 40 These functions include: government institutions, internationally significant business headquarters, cultural, science and tourist facilities of national or international importance and centres of excellence in higher education as set out within the Central Activities Zone Supplementary Planning Guidance (GLA, 2016).", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**10.

Within this zone, proposals should consist of or provide a significant quantum of employment floorspace or other strategic CAZ uses relative to the surrounding context of the site. Other uses which may include residential will be encouraged. The borough’s Local Employment Locations (LELs) have relatively 10.15 high public transport accessibility levels and support significant numbers of jobs but have unique individual characteristics. Applicants should aim to ensure that new employment space that is brought forward contributes to and meets the demands of each area. In particular within the Whitechapel LEL. New development within LELs will be expected to provide high-quality flexible workspace designed to meet the needs of emerging and growing sectors (e.g. research and development) as well as other small-to-medium enterprises and creative businesses. Tower Hamlets has a relatively limited supply of industrial land 10.16 and floorspace, despite high levels of market demand, in the face of increasing competition from other land uses, such as housing. There are clusters of existing industrial activity predominantly in the north east of the borough along key transport routes. These sites need to be protected to support the long term needs of the borough and the role of the City of London and Canary Wharf as global economic hubs (some services need to be in close proximity to the end user and immediately available). This will be achieved through the designation of the Strategic Industrial Location (Empson Street) and Local Industrial Locations (see Part 1). As well as retaining existing designations, new LILs have been identified at Blackwall Trading Estate and Thomas Road (as shown on the Policies Map) to secure the long term provision of industrial space. SECTION 3: POLICIES Part 1 also highlights that town centres are locations in which 10.17 non-retail employment uses will be supported, subject to the provision of active frontages at ground floor level. This is because town centres are located throughout the borough and are able to offer smaller spaces which meet the needs of businesses serving the local community. Within the Tower Hamlets Activity Areas and some District Centres and Neighbourhood Centres (as shown on the Policies Map), purpose-built office buildings can be supported where they are of a nature and scale which corresponds with their surroundings. Within the Primary and Secondary Frontages, employment spaces should be located on upper floors so as not to undermine the retail and leisure functions of those areas. Proposals outside of designated employment locations and 10.18 the town centre hierarchy (see Part 1) will be supported where they demonstrate that there is a need and demand, with further detail set out in Policy D.EMP2. Part 2 sets out the information required to support proposals that 10.19 do not meet the employment thresholds under Part 1. Further guidance on how applicants can assess schemes in relation to employment targets is set out within our monitoring and delivery framework (see Table 6 in Section 5). Part 3 describes how development should contribute to meeting 10.20 our long term objectives to support investment and job creation in the borough. Tower Hamlets has a diverse economy ranging from the globally-significant financial centre of Canary Wharf and the associated services required to support it (and the neighbouring City of London) to creative and cultural industries, industrial uses, secondary offices and businesses, meeting a very local need. Employment activities are distributed across the borough with specific locations supporting clusters of particular businesses or unit types.

This has the dual benefit of supporting new and emerging economic sectors and providing additional space for small-andmedium enterprises and micro-businesses that provide employment for a significant proportion of the borough’s population. Development incorporating a range of unit types and sizes will be encouraged, including where these are clustered within a single building and provide shared and networking facilities. Developments should address the most up-to-date requirements as part of pre-application discussions. We will particularly welcome proposals which demonstrate co-operation with recognised workspace providers, for which we hold an approved list. Opportunities for the long-term management of new units by a company specialising in flexible and affordable workspace provision should be fully explored as part of the planning application process and may be secured for the long term through planning obligations. 41 Tower Hamlets Growth Sectors and SME Workspace Study (2016) 102 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits Explanation Part 1 of the policy encourages the provision of additional 10.22 employment floorspace to meet demand and the needs of different business types. Where new provision is proposed, it must be located in the most viable locations to support the role and function of the borough’s designated employment locations and to proactively avoid long-term vacancy or subsequent conversion to other uses. This policy seeks to direct new provision to the designated employment locations, activity areas and site allocations which include employment space as a first priority, then to locations of highest activity, accessibility and visibility (see Part 2) and finally to other locations (see Part 3) where it meets strict criteria. For the purposes of this policy, major routes are considered 10.23 to include the borough’s A roads and other roads along the strategic highway network where there is a high level of accessibility, visibility and footfall. Development outside of the areas referenced in Parts 1 and 2 will 10.24 be expected to demonstrate through a detailed marketing strategy that the demand within the relevant part of the borough has been assessed and that anticipated asking rents/purchase price for the new unit(s) would be appropriate to the location (according to indicative figures) or that an occupier for the space has been secured. Temporary employment units can activate spaces that would otherwise remain redundant in advance of more permanent development. Temporary uses would be expected to only remain in place for a defined period of time, or until the site comes forward for development to meet its full potential or allocated use(s). SECTION 3: POLICIES the indicative market rate for the relevant location, for a period of not less than ten years. The floorspace and discount thresholds above are treated as minimum targets and anything above will be subject to viability (in line with Policy D.SG5). Applicants should work with our enterprise team and recognised affordable workspace providers (for which we hold an approved list) to determine the nature of the affordable workspace provision on a case by case basis. Applicants may wish to manage the space either themselves or in association with a provider not included on an approved list, provided we can agree on these terms. In all cases, the applicant will be required to provide details of management arrangements as part of the planning application. In exceptional cases, where an occupier requires exclusive use 10.26 of a single office property, such as a global headquarters building, we may consider implementing the development with alternative affordable workspace provision. Any alternative provision should in the first instance be provided as part of the same development scheme or secondly within the same sub area (as defined in Policy S.SG1). But where this is not possible, nor in our view desirable, then provision elsewhere in the borough may be considered. Any alternative provision should be of equivalent value which may translate into greater floorspace than the original proposal if an alternative location is considered. 10.27 Part 5 aims to prevent long-term vacancy caused by high fitout costs and lack of supporting infrastructure deterring interest from potential tenants. For example, development should provide sufficient cycle spaces, appropriate levels of natural light and a range of shared services and facilities appropriate to the size and scale of the unit (such as communal breakout spaces, kitchen areas, showers and childcare facilities) which do not detract from the visual appearance of the development or its surroundings. In the case of office developments high-speed broadband connectivity should be provided to serve the enduser. Industrial units would be expected to provide double-height units with appropriate access and good standards of internal sound insulation to minimise conflict with surrounding uses. Part 4 seeks to ensure that major development (i.e. which 10.25 comprises at least 1,000 square metres of gross commercial floorspace relating to B1, B2 and B8 uses) is flexibly designed to provide at least 10% of affordable workspace to meet the needs of more local businesses as well as start-ups. To address this policy, applicants should let the workspace at an affordable tenancy rate, at least 10% below", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**10.

In such cases, applications will not be supported (see Part 6). Instead, we would welcome proposals that offer a range of uses (including employment and housing) as separate units within the same site. 104 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits Explanation This policy describes the criteria that will be used to address the 10.29 potential loss of employment space within the borough in line with the vision and objectives of the plan (see Section 2). To ensure the supply of employment land to meet identified demand is maintained, proposals which result in the loss of employment floorspace within the POLs, SILs and LILs (as shown on the Policies Map and Figure 10) will not be supported. Consequently, we will be seeking to implement an Article 4 direction removing permitted development rights from offices to residential uses covering designated employment areas and other key locations. Within the Primary and Secondary POLs, the expectation is that development proposals are employment-led in line with the policies and principles set out in Policy S.EMP1. Proposals involving the loss of industrial land that is located outside the SIL or LILs will be considered on a site-by-site basis in accordance with Part 2 above. Part 2 requires evidence covering a continuous period of at least 10.30 24 months in order to prevent unnecessary loss of existing employment space which would put pressure on the ability of the borough to meet projected need. Applicants should outline where and how marketing has been undertaken, with details also provided to demonstrate that the asking rent has been at a realistic rate for the type, size and condition of the property/unit. Such information should accord with our indicative guidance which is regularly updated. It would be expected that the property or site has been actively marketed, including appearing on local and national commercial property websites and visible display boards being displayed at the site. Applicants should provide us with a report detailing the level of interest in the property over the 24-month period, details of any viewings and offers, and details of why any interest had not been taken forward. SECTION 3: POLICIES It is recognised that, in some cases, requiring 24 months 10.31 marketing evidence may be counterproductive to enhancing local character if the condition of the property is such that attempting to let it would be unrealistic. In such cases, the applicant should submit a detailed report on the history and condition of the property to robustly justify why marketing evidence should not be required and that reprovided employment space as part of redevelopment would not be viable. It should be demonstrated that the proposed development would not prejudice wider land-use objectives or the delivery of site allocations, and that reverse-sensitivity issues would not arise through conflict with surrounding existing uses, particularly where it lies within a cluster of other employment uses. The report should also demonstrate that the benefits of an alternative use would outweigh the benefits of the employment use to meet other local plan objectives, such as the need for complementary town centre uses or to maintain active frontages within town centres. Due to the mixed employment nature of the LELs, applicants 10.32 should prove that the site or unit is unsuited to continued employment use in any form (e.g. a B1 office use could not be used for light manufacturing or research and development).", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**10.

The Primary POL has the capacity to provide significant additional office floorspace and, as such, proposals which intensify existing sites or provide new office developments will be welcomed. Parts 2 and 3 seek to strike an appropriate balance between 10.34 offices, CAZ strategic uses and housing to meet future growth and the place-making objectives of mixed-use development. Any redevelopment proposals within the Secondary POL and CAZ (tertiary area) should meet the requirements set out in Parts 1 and 2 of Policy S.EMP1. Part 4 provides guidance as to the types of spaces that are 10.35 appropriate within each LEL to maintain their function and support their individual characteristics, and should be applied on a case-by-case basis considering other proposals in the area to ensure that a mix of appropriate unit types are provided across the areas as a whole. It is accepted that there are opportunities to redevelop or 10.36 intensify some LILs and LELs and that in some cases the introduction of residential uses may be appropriate. Parts 4 and 5 of the policy seek to strike an appropriate balance between employment and other uses (particularly housing) to ensure that the employment function of LELs and LILs is maintained. New or re-provided industrial employment units should be completed to a standard that meets the needs of industrial users (e.g. a ground floor location with appropriate unit heights and direct vehicle access). The industrial uses should be the primary consideration early in the design phase. SECTION 3: POLICIES Where development is proposed within a LIL, appropriate 10.37 justification should be provided to demonstrate that conflict between current and future industrial uses at the site would be avoided and that non-industrial uses are compatible with the function of the site in line with the criteria set out in Part 1. This could include appropriate soundproofing and/or implementing separate access and servicing. Part 6 encourages the retention of employers and jobs in the 10.38 borough. However, it is recognised that in some cases it may be beneficial for the business itself to move to another location. This part of the policy will therefore be applied flexibly on a case-by-case basis, but is applicable to all types of application that may result in business displacement and not exclusively within designated employment locations. To satisfy this policy, we will require information about how the existing business which would be displaced as a result of development would be accommodated elsewhere in the borough. If the business is to be located in an out-ofborough location, it would be necessary to demonstrate that there is no disadvantage to existing employees in terms of access; the quality and quantity of such facilities will be improved; and that a suitable site within the borough could not be found.", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**10.

They also provide significant opportunities for employment and housing, particularly on upper floors. Additionally, across the borough, there are other areas of commercial, leisure and retail activity (including individual stand-alone units) which have a role in supporting the borough’s needs. These policies seek to ensure that our town centres remain 11.2 vibrant and sustainable while continuing to meet the needs of the people that use them.

The western part of the borough (as shown on Figures 5 and 11) 11.6 lies within the Central Activities Zone. The Central Activities Zone is the geographical, economic and administrative heart of London, one of the world’s most important financial and business centres, and contains the major employment, leisure and retail designations within London. All development proposals within this zone should primarily 11.7 refer to the relevant policies set out in the London Plan and the Central Activities Zone Supplementary Planning Guidance. Major Centres generally contain over 50,000 square metres 11.8 of retail and leisure floorspace and serve a borough-wide catchment area [43] . Development within the Major Centre of Canary Wharf would be expected to demonstrate that it contributes to the continuing growth of Canary Wharf and supports its role as an important centre for international business and finance within the Primary and Secondary Preferred Office Locations, as well as its emerging residential neighbourhood at Wood Wharf. 11.9 Canary Wharf is already fulfilling the role of a metropolitan centre because it serves a wide catchment area, extending over several boroughs and into parts of the wider south east region. It contains over 100,000 square metres of retail, leisure and service floorspace with a significant proportion of high-order comparison goods relative to convenience goods as well as significant employment, service and leisure functions. This policy sets guidelines to help facilitate and support the re-designation of Canary Wharf as a Metropolitan Centre. SECTION 3: POLICIES The Tower Hamlets Activity Areas (as shown on the Policies Map) 11.10 are specific areas bordering the Central Activities Zone and the Major Centre of Canary Wharf where the scale, continuity and intensity of town centre activity and land use is different to that found across the rest of the borough. Within the Tower Hamlets Activity Areas, applicants will be expected to demonstrate how the proposals will enhance movement and connectivity to and through the designation, in particular improving links between Canary Wharf and surrounding areas to the north and south. Where the proposed site is within a Tower Hamlets Activity Area 11.11 but outside of a Major, District or Neighbourhood Centre boundary, applications should include assessments of the mix of uses within a reasonable surrounding radius, outlining how the proposed use would contribute to and support the area’s function to avoid over concentrations of uses. District Centres (as shown on the Policies Map) generally meet 11.12 more local needs, with catchments of around 800 metres and provision of convenience goods and services. Typically, they contain around 10,000-50,000 square metres of retail, leisure and service floorspace, and often have specialist functions. They have high levels of accessibility. They are also generally suitable locations for housing and employment. While Whitechapel currently has the status of a District Centre, 11.13 the opening of the Elizabeth line and the emergence of a nationally important high-tech and bio-science cluster means it has the potential to be re-designated as a Major Centre before the end of the plan period. Such growth in Whitechapel to enable re-designation would include delivery of a new civic centre, additional employment and retail space and public realm improvements, with a relatively high proportion of comparison goods relative to convenience goods. Each year, we will monitor the development of the Canary Wharf and Whitechapel town centres over the course of the plan period to provide evidence to inform future reviews of the London Plan. 43 The Central Activities Zone, Major Centres and District Centres are defined in the London Plan (GLA, 2016)", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**11.

Units are predominantly small-in-scale, with convenience supermarkets of around 500 square metres tending to be the largest occupants. Larger neighbourhood centres may also have particular specialist functions, and can be appropriate for some leisure and night-time economy uses. Three new neighbourhood centres have been identified at the following locations: Burdett Road South, London City Island and South Quay, whose designation reflects existing mixed-use activity and/or responds to recent developments and anticipated population growth. In particular, the designation of South Quay reflects the aspiration within the South Quay Masterplan Supplementary Planning Document to create a ‘high street’ environment along Marsh Wall, with an enhanced convenience offer and other local services to meet the immediate needs of residents. Such provision would complement rather than compete with the adjacent major centre at Canary Wharf. Columbia Road and Redchurch Street have individual 11.15 characteristics in comparison to other neighbourhood centres that have emerged in recent years, with a growth in specialist retail along with some leisure provision. As such, development proposals within those designations will be subject to additional requirements in comparison to other neighbourhood centres and these are set out in subsequent policies to help maintain their uniqueness and appeal. 11.16 Table 3 provides a breakdown of the retail floorspace capacity requirements across Major, District and Neighbourhood Centres during the plan period.

Please note: Where identified that there is ‘no capacity’, this represents a negative retail capacity figure as a result of committed development. 114 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES 11.17 The level of need for retail floorspace set out in Table 3 is based on a constant market share approach over the plan period. It takes into account the impact of committed development, which is why some town centres do not have any floorspace capacity in the comparison retail sector as a result of the growth potential in these areas, particularly in Canary Wharf. 11.18 These figures should not, however, represent a ceiling to new development. New floorspace and investment may enhance the profile of a town centre, helping to claw back expenditure, and increase market share and trade retention. Furthermore, there is still no certainty that committed development will come forward as planned in the short term, highlighting the importance of ensuring these figures are kept under review throughout the plan period.", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**11.

Primary Frontages include a high proportion of retail uses, while Secondary Frontages provide opportunities for a greater diversity of uses to support the vitality and viability of the town centres. Where comprehensive redevelopment alters the layout of existing 11.20 Major, District or Neighbourhood centres, proposals to change the use of a retail unit within the redeveloped town centre will be assessed based on the character and mix of uses of the surroundings within the redeveloped site. Development will be expected to contribute towards achieving a 11.21 minimum of 60% of units as A1 retail use within the Primary Frontages and 40% of units as A1 retail use within the Secondary Frontages. Due to their unique nature and characteristics, the minimum 60% figure should also be applied to Columbia Road and Redchurch Street Neighbourhood Centres to promote and maintain the specialist function of those areas. This will ensure that retail remains the dominant use within these areas and core function of the town centre to reinforce its vitality, viability and attractiveness. The Primary Frontages (see Part 1) will have the highest levels of activity and footfall. As such, it is also appropriate to locate uses to these areas which enhance the character and attractiveness of the town centre as a place to visit, such as cafés, restaurants and drinking establishments. Other uses would be appropriate on upper floors within the primary frontages, such as offices, gyms or residential uses. However, access to upper levels must be designed to promote street-level activity and not undermine the viability of ground-level units. SECTION 3: POLICIES 11.22 Within the Secondary Frontages, a wider mix of uses (e.g. financial and professional services, community and leisure facilities) which contribute to the vitality and viability of the town centre will be supported. On this basis, a lower minimum retail threshold will be appropriate. However, it would not be appropriate to allow the clustering of non-retail uses where it would have negative impacts on the health and well-being of the town centre within these or any other locations. Undesignated frontages are areas within the District Centres (see 11.23 Part 4) that contribute to the overall offer of the centre but perform a more tertiary function (e.g. small offices, wholesalers and market storage) or community functions with little or no retail use. Frontages have not been designated within the Canary Wharf 11.24 Major Centre. This is because it is a predominantly undercover shopping complex in single, private ownership that functions differently to other town centres in the borough. A minimum proportion of 40% of units within Neighbourhood 11.25 Centres (excluding Columbia Road and Redchurch Street) and Neighbourhood Parades should be within A1 retail use. As part of the planning application process, applicants are 11.26 advised to undertake surveys (e.g. vacancy rates) to justify that changes of use would not result in the proportions of A1 units within the Primary and Secondary Frontages falling below the proportions set out in the policy above. Where marketing evidence is required as part of Part 6, applicants should outline where and how marketing has been undertaken, having regard to our guidance on marketing which will be regularly updated. For instance, marketing activity must include evidence that the asking rent has been set at a realistic rate and the site has been advertised on national commercial and retail property websites.

We will regularly monitor the mix of uses within the borough’s town centres through the Annual Monitoring Report. Frontages are calculated as a whole across the centre, not within individual stretches of units. The design, accessibility and layout of town centres will have an 11.27 important impact upon their success, and in turn the health and wellbeing of local people. This policy seeks to promote a range of unit sizes and types within each centre to meet the needs of different users and occupants. In relation to Part 7(a), applicants need to demonstrate that development proposals would not lead to an over-supply of particular unit types which confirms that there is a range of unit types across the wider town centre and that there is a need for the size and type of unit being proposed. In addition, the Transport for London’s Healthy Streets principles should be applied to the design, accessibility and layout of town centres in order to ensure they remain attractive and competitive. Whilst the changing nature of town centres and consumer 11.28 demands may mean less need and demand for retail space in some locations, the requirements set out in the policy where loss of retail (A1 use) is proposed ensures that any loss will need to be clearly justified (e.g. where units are too large to let as a single entity; therefore subdivision would increase attractiveness to potential occupants). However, it is acknowledged that there may be instances where 11.29 some loss of floorspace within the Primary Frontages contributes to achieving wider objectives, such as the redevelopment of the site or improving access to upper levels. In such cases, street-level retail units should remain of a size and scale that is viable to current or future occupants and that access to upper levels has been designed so as to not undermine the activity and function of the Primary Frontage. In order to satisfy Part 7, applicants will need to provide examples of other retail units of similar proposed size and layout in the area which are occupied and the types of occupants that such units attract. Information on the local market should also be submitted, including details of retailer demands and lettings in the local area to ensure that development does not result in ‘token’ retail units being created that are too small for the requirements of occupants. 118 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES Explanation New retail development will be directed towards existing centres 11.30 in accordance with the sequential approach set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) which assesses the suitability of alternative sites in the following order of priority: town centres, edge-of centre sites and other out-of-centre locations which are well connected to existing centres. However, subject to meeting the requirements set out in Part 1, we recognise that demand for retail also exists in locations outside of Major, District and Neighbourhood Centres to meet the immediate convenience needs of local people and/or support the function of designated employment locations. New retail units or extensions outside of the centres set out in 11.31 Part 1 should not exceed 200 square metres gross floorspace to ensure that they are local in nature and do not harm the vitality and viability of existing centres. Where individual retail units exceed the size limit set out in Part 1, applicants will be required to submit an impact assessment in accordance with the NPPF. The primary shopping areas of the Major and District Centres are illustrated on the Policies Map. For Neighbourhood Centres, their boundaries (as illustrated on the Policies Map) will equate to the primary shopping areas of these centres. The Central Activities Zone and Tower Hamlets Activity Areas 11.32 have a unique role in the town centre hierarchy. New retail uses may be appropriate in these areas, especially those of a smaller scale, where they would not detrimentally affect the vitality and viability of Major, District or Neighbourhood Centres. We take a judgement-based approach to proposals within these areas and a sequential test and/or impact assessment may still be required where a proposal has a potentially adverse impact on one or more Major, District or Neighbourhood Centre. Part 2 contains a general presumption against the loss of retail 11.33 space outside of town centres. However, in certain circumstances, such losses may be justified.

However, it is recognised that in some cases requiring marketing evidence may be counterproductive to enhancing local character if the condition of the property is such that attempting to let it would be unrealistic. In such cases, the applicant should submit a detailed report on the history and condition of the property to robustly justify why marketing evidence should not be required and that re-provided retail space as part of redevelopment would not be viable at the location. Explanation Part 1 of the policy seeks to guide the location and scale of uses 11.34 within the A2 use class (financial and professional services).

Such uses have become important in preventing and reducing vacancy in town centres. They can also help to increase activity in town centres outside of traditional shopping hours, thus contributing to town centre vitality and a greater perception of safety from increased natural surveillance. Within the Primary Frontages of the District Centres and the 11.37 Columbia Road and Redchurch Street Neighbourhood Centres, as shown on the Policies Map, new A3 and A4 uses can be supported where the overall proportion of A1 retail does not fall below 60% of all units. Therefore, where change of use is proposed in those areas, applicants should provide a town centre survey outlining that an appropriate level of A1 retail is being maintained to ensure the vitality and viability of the area as the primary shopping area. Within Secondary Frontages in the District Centres and Neighbourhood Centres, applicants should demonstrate that the overall mix of uses would be conducive to the future vitality and viability of the town centre. Within the Central Activities Zone and Tower Hamlets Activity Areas, proposals involving new A3 and A4 uses will be managed on a case-by-case basis, with the onus on applicants to demonstrate there would not be an over-concentration of similar uses within the surrounding area. We recognise that, in some instances, it may be appropriate 11.38 and desirable to locate A3 and A4 uses within Neighbourhood Parades or outside of Major, District and Neighbourhood Centres, Tower Hamlets Activity Areas and the Central Activities Zone, although robust justification must be provided (see Part 2). Examples might include SECTION 3: POLICIES facilities that enhance the enjoyment of open spaces and water spaces; serve transport interchanges or serve out-of-town-centre employment areas. For instance, new or replacement community pubs will be sought to meet local needs in locations where an existing public house may have been lost to redevelopment. Within Neighbourhood Parades and non-designated locations, 11.39 proposals involving A3 and A4 uses should be of a more modest scale than might be expected in larger town centres. Applicants should robustly state why a café, restaurant or drinking establishment would be appropriate in such a location. Details of any other cafés, restaurants or drinking establishments in the local area should also be provided to mitigate the risk of clusters developing that could undermine nearby town centres. In respect of drinking establishments, a detailed management plan should be submitted alongside the planning application confirming that it will be run as a ‘community’ public house and that conflicts with neighbouring properties would be avoided. Applicants would also be encouraged to consider our statement of licensing policy. In order to satisfy Part 3, planning applications will be expected 11.40 to include information (including town centre surveys) in order to ensure that any provision of new hot food takeaways would not exceed the levels set out in Parts (a) to (c). In order to satisfy Part 4, applicants should outline details of other 11.41 such premises within the local area to demonstrate that there would not be a clustering or over-concentration of such businesses.

In certain circumstances, such uses would be preferable outside of town centres due to the impact on surrounding amenity through noise or the negative impact on town centre appearance resulting from inactive frontages or requirements for space. 124 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits Explanation For the purposes of this policy, visitor accommodation refers to 11.43 provision within the C1 use class, such as hotels, bed and breakfasts, traveller hostels, serviced apartments and self-catering apartments. This policy seeks to steer visitor accommodation towards the Central Activities Zone, Canary Wharf Major Centre, Tower Hamlets Activity Areas, and the borough’s District Centres, or along primary routes (e.g. A-roads) where they are adjacent to transport interchanges (such as Docklands Light Railway/railway/underground/bus stations. Short stay accommodation schemes should be of a size that 11.44 reflects their surrounding built environment and reflects the function of the location within town centres or employment areas. For example, a large-scale hotel that is appropriate in the Major Centre of Canary Wharf may not be suitable within a smaller District Centre. 11.45 This policy applies a flexible approach to the assessment of new visitor accommodation. This recognises the different markets that various forms of visitor accommodation may serve, and the way in which customers and service vehicles may access such accommodation. For example, traveller hostels, budget hotels and small boutique hotels are less likely to require significant space for coaches and other vehicles setting down and picking up movements as customers are more likely to arrive via public transport. Developers and applicants will need to submit information 11.46 detailing how customers would access the accommodation (e.g. whether this would be mostly utilising existing public transport provision and if not there is appropriate provision for vehicles setting down or picking up). This would also apply to any vehicles required to service the accommodation (e.g. to handle laundry and deliver other supplies to the accommodation). It should be demonstrated that such movements would not create unacceptable impacts on residential amenity or highway safety in accordance with Policies D.DH8 and D.TR2. SECTION 3: POLICIES For serviced apartments, development will be required to provide 11.47 the following details: a. Management will ensure rooms will not be occupied for periods of 90 days or more b. Management will provide 24-hour servicing c. Telephone lines will be provided in the rooms with no opportunity for personal lines installed by the occupier d. Management will ensure rooms will be charged out at a maximum at weekly rates e.

They can also act as incubation space for new ideas and small-to-medium enterprises. This policy aims to protect the borough’s existing markets and ensure that new development does not undermine their future role and function (e.g. ensuring that storage facilities are maintained). While new markets within Major, District or Neighbourhood 11.49 Centres are favoured, this policy also recognises that there may be opportunities for markets outside of town centres where they activate vacant spaces. Applicants and developers should work with our markets team 11.50 at the earliest opportunity so that information can be provided with the planning application to show that sufficient space will be safeguarded to meet the needs of traders in terms of servicing and storage. Proposals should also detail how the types of goods and services proposed would complement rather than compete with surrounding town centres, as well as how they could contribute to other priorities such as improving access to healthy, affordable food.

Supporting community ** **facilities **", "content": "Introduction Tower Hamlets has a range of community facilities such as health, 12.1 social, education, leisure and sport facilities providing valuable services to both local communities and visitors. The provision of these essential community facilities plays a vital role in creating and sustaining liveable neighbourhoods through providing valuable services. Community facilities are facing increased pressure from higher 12.2 land value uses, such as housing and employment, in the face of limited public funding and a fast-growing resident and worker population. Specific need gaps and priorities include the provision of public houses, youth centres, local presence facilities/Idea Stores, indoor sport facilities and community halls. These policies will seek to promote and facilitate the delivery 12.3 of essential community facilities through new development (including changes of use, extensions and new builds) in line with the Infrastructure Delivery Plan, which outlines the existing capacity and future needs and priorities facing some of the community facilities in the borough. In particular, they aim to ensure that sufficient facilities are provided to meet the needs of the borough’s growing population in the areas of greatest need and growth, as described in Section 4. This section contains the following policies: 12.4 z Policy S.CF1: Supporting community facilities z Policy D.CF2: Existing community facilities z Policy D.CF3: New and enhanced community facilities z Policy D.CF4: Public houses. Explanation This policy seeks to maintain an adequate supply and range 12.5 of community facilities across the borough to serve local needs and support the creation of more liveable and sustainable places in line with the vision and objectives set out in Section 2. Delivery of new and improvements to existing community facilities will be achieved through the use of developer contributions (as identified in Policy D.SG5) and working together with partners to ensure adequate services are in place to support the sustainable growth of the borough. 128 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits For the purpose of this policy, community facilities include a range 12.6 of social infrastructure that provide services to the community such as: SECTION 3: POLICIES borough and such uses contribute to the vitality and viability of town centres. In addition, new facilities will be directed towards locations which are accessible to their catchment areas. This policy will be delivered in accordance with the Infrastructure 12.12 Delivery Plan and other relevant strategies, including the Indoor Sports Facilities Strategy, Open Space Strategy, Green Grid Strategy and areabased masterplans. We will continue to work with key stakeholders and other service providers to ensure that new community facilities are provided at locations where there is a clearly demonstrated need. a. Indoor sports and leisure facilities (e.g. leisure centres and swimming pools) b. Health facilities (e.g. hospitals and doctor surgeries) c. Cultural facilities (e.g. art galleries, museums and theatres) d. Education facilities (e.g. schools, nurseries and universities) e. Social facilities (e.g. places of worship, libraries, Idea Stores, local presence and public houses). 12.7 Playing fields and outdoor sport facilities, such as multi-use games areas and tennis courts, are also important community facilities. These are addressed within Policies S.OWS1 and D.OWS3. Part 1 sets out a presumption against the loss of community 12.8 facilities to ensure that sufficient provision is available to meet local needs. Part 2 promotes opportunities to expand or improve the capacity 12.9 and accessibility of existing facilities, taking account of future projected community needs (as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan). Part 3 seeks to encourage the provision of multi-purpose and 12.10 shared services which provide opportunities to co-locate or integrate a range of community uses and functions, such as community halls and sport facilities. Consideration should be given to promoting community facilities which can be easily accessed, support a wide range of users in line with the principles of active and inclusive design and make relevant provision outside of core hours, particularly in respect of childcare provision, external recreation space, sport facilities and appropriate classroom space.

Part 1 seeks to resist the loss of the borough’s valuable 12.14 community facilities, except in certain circumstances, see (a) and (b). Statements from relevant providers confirming that the existing or alternative community uses would not be needed or possible in the premises will be required. Where the loss of a community facility is justified, the applicant will need to explore the opportunity to accommodate an alternative community use which would better meet local needs, in accordance with relevant strategies, including the Indoor Sports Facilities Strategy, Open Space Strategy and Infrastructure Delivery Plan. Loss of sports and recreational facilities will only be justified where an applicant can provide a robust assessment demonstrating surplus provision or where the proposal includes a replacement of the facility with at least an equivalent function, quality and quantity of sport provision that better meets the needs of the community. We recognise that in certain circumstances site redevelopment 12.15 will require the relocation of existing uses to a location where the needs of the users will be more adequately met. To ensure that there is no unacceptable disadvantage to existing users, re-provision of community facilities should be within the relevant catchment area and should result in quality and access improvements, reflecting the principles of active and inclusive design.

Part 1 seeks to ensure that expansion of existing and delivery of 12.20 new community facilities is directed towards accessible locations such as town centres. However, new community facilities outside of town centres will only be supported where sufficient evidence is provided to demonstrate that there is a local need not being met elsewhere in the neighbourhood. Facilities provided in these locations need to ensure that they are local in nature and scale and that there is no adverse impact on the amenity of the surrounding residents. This includes the impact of people coming and going to the facility and the impact of users within the facility when it is in use, as well as the impact on the highway network and parking facilities. Where the provision of a community facility is proposed as part of a residential development, it should be demonstrated that it is accessible to people living outside of the development and designed to be visible from the street. Part 2 aims to ensure that new community facilities which form 12.21 part of a wider development are designed to facilitate and encourage wider community use and do not look and feel exclusive to the occupants of the development. Consideration should be given to ensuring that the facility can be easily accessible to a wide range of users. Part 3 encourages the provision of education facilities at early 12.22 years, primary and secondary level in appropriate locations, where they meet local need and demonstrate high quality and inclusive design in line with the relevant guidance from the Department for Education, Sport England and other relevant national governing bodies (for instance, suitable locations for early years could include the ground floor of residential blocks or secondary frontages in existing town centres). In order to ensure that education facilities are suitably located, 12.23 applicants should outline the indicative catchment area for the recruitment of pupils and assess the impact of people (including pupils, parents, carers and staff) arriving and leaving the facility as well as the impact on the highway network and parking facilities. Demand for early education and care facilities will increase in 12.24 the future as the borough’s birth rate continues to rise. Early education and care facilities refer to places where a number of children under five years of age are brought together during part or all of a working day on a regular basis where they can play, learn and receive care (e.g. primary school nurseries, children’s centres, pre-school and ‘wrap-around’ childcare). The provision of early year facilities will contribute towards reducing the borough’s current below-average levels of achieving good cognitive development at age 5 and enable greater employment rates amongst parents in line with our statutory duty to provide childcare to some 2-year-olds and all 3-and-4-year-olds. Future provision will increasingly require innovative approaches to the use of land and floor space, including the co-location of early education and care facilities with compatible uses, such as primary and secondary schools and office buildings. Further and higher education (see Part 5) refers to the stage 12.25 of education after secondary school and includes a wide range of institutions including universities and colleges (as defined in the glossary in Appendix 1) which provide lifelong learning. It is noted that some further education colleges do include sixth form provision. In order to meet these requirements, the applicant will need to provide evidence of the relevant certification from the Department for Education as well as details of student and staff numbers, enrolment criteria and curriculum details.

In order to satisfy Part 1(b), applicants will need to submit a full 12.28 detailed marketing report outlining the asking price or rent for the public house and the terms on which it was offered (e.g. freehold or leasehold: whether or not it included living accommodation and whether any part of the property was excluded). The report should include details of any interest in the property, viewings, and why such interest was not taken forward. This information should also be provided for a subsequent 12-month period outlining attempts to let the property for alternative community uses as described under Part 1(c). Part 2 seeks to avoid future examples in the borough of what are 12.29 termed ‘trojan horse’ pubs. This term refers to developments that have met policy requirements through the re-provision of floorspace for pub use but at a level that is insufficient to be practically let as a pub, resulting in a subsequent application to convert the space to an alternative use. This part of the policy seeks to ensure that there is a genuine intention to continue pub use where redevelopment is proposed. It must also be 46 Pubs in Tower Hamlets – Evidence Study (2017) demonstrated that appropriate soundproofing is to be installed so as to minimise conflict between the pub and any residential use. In order to satisfy this criterion, applicants should submit indicative floorplans demonstrating that, at a minimum, the proposed floorspace for pub use can support a bar area, appropriate seating, storage and toilets. Applicants seeking to reduce or remove outdoor space must 12.30 demonstrate that the remaining space is of sufficient size and quality for the needs of pub users, and that the pub could continue to operate viably following any loss or reduction. It must also be demonstrated that any smokers displaced from such spaces would not cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of surrounding properties by gathering in alternative locations. Where loss or conversion of ancillary function space or living 12.31 accommodation is proposed, it must be demonstrated that the pub use would not be undermined through such loss. For the loss of function space, evidence is also required to demonstrate the availability of sufficient and suitable alternative facilities available within the local area. 134 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**12.

Enhancing open spaces and ** **water spaces **", "content": "Introduction Tower Hamlets has a number of valued open spaces and water 13.1 spaces which offer many important social, environmental and economic benefits, including: z Enhancing amenity; z Contributing to healthy lifestyles through providing opportunities for active travel and leisure z Providing sport and recreation opportunities z Providing meeting places for community activities and cultural events z Helping to manage flood risk and mitigating the risks of climate change z Enhancing biodiversity, and z Providing a cooling effect to reduce elevated urban air temperature. The overall provision of publicly accessible open space remains 13.2 low with some parts of the borough being acutely deficient, including the Isle of Dogs, Shoreditch and Whitechapel. This equates to 0.89 hectares per 1,000 residents, which is less than the borough’s open space standard of 1.2 hectares per 1,000 residents [47] . SECTION 3: POLICIES In a densely populated borough like Tower Hamlets facing 13.3 significant development pressure, there is limited scope to provide major additional open space to accommodate the needs of the growing population, such as new parkland and woodland. Nevertheless, the borough’s open spaces make a significant positive contribution to the character and appearance of the borough, reflecting their popularity among residents and visitors, relatively good condition and varied use. Some parks (e.g. Victoria Park) are nationally renowned and have been awarded Green Flag status. In order to meet this shortfall, it is estimated that 220 hectares 13.4 of additional publicly accessible open space will be required across the borough over the period to 2031. As the population continues to grow there will be an increasing 13.5 need to protect and revitalise our existing open spaces as well as secure additional publicly accessible open space, especially within deficient areas (see Figure 13). Tower Hamlets has access to more water spaces than any other 13.6 London borough, comprising the rivers Thames and Lea and the other connecting water spaces (e.g. Limehouse Cut, Regents Canal and Hertford Union Canal) as well as several docks and basins. However, much of the potential of the borough’s water spaces remains untapped, due to fragmented public access and limited active recreation and leisure opportunities. Tower Hamlets has also experienced significant historic water loss, particularly around Shadwell Basin and the Ornamental Canal, while a considerable amount of water space has been reclaimed and re-used to frame development around West India Docks, Blackwall Basin and Poplar Dock in Canary Wharf. This has further limited the availability of water spaces for recreation, transport and other water-related activities. It has also impacted on the biodiversity of the waterways as well as the open character of our valuable water space heritage assets. 47 In particular, Tower Hamlets faces a significant shortfall in the provision of playing pitches, especially outdoor sports provision, due to the fact that most grass pitches are located at parks or areas of open space where often they serve multiple functions, such as recreational open space and non-sports related activities.

The Open Space Strategy sets out where strategic open space 13.11 (i.e. one hectare or above) will be provided across the borough. This includes the requirements relating to the provision of playing pitches and a detailed action plan on how our open space priorities will be addressed. Further details on the specific needs and priorities for the provision of playing pitches and outdoor sport facilities are outlined in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan. The Green Grid Strategy identifies opportunities on how to better connect existing open spaces and create smaller scale open spaces in areas of need. For the purposes of the Local Plan, open space means all land 13.12 that offers opportunity for play, recreation and sport or is of amenity value, whether in public or private ownership, and where public access is unrestricted, partially-restricted or restricted. This includes all open areas consisting of: major parks (e.g. Victoria Park and Mile End Park), local parks, gardens, squares, playgrounds, ecological spaces, housing amenity land, playing fields (including playing pitches), allotments and burial grounds, whether or not they are accessible to the public. This definition does not include water bodies. Figure 12 illustrates the distribution of publicly accessible open 13.13 spaces across the borough. Detailed boundaries of the borough’s publicly accessible open spaces are shown on the Policies Map. Some of the borough’s open spaces and water spaces are designated as Metropolitan Open Land (including East India Dock Basin and Brunswick Wharf, Island Gardens, Lee Valley Regional Park, Meath Gardens, Mile End Park, Mudchute Park, Millwall Park, Tower Hamlets Cemetery and Victoria SECTION 3: POLICIES Park) which form part of London’s strategically defined open space network. Part 1(a) seeks to protect all open spaces regardless of their size, 13.14 type, ownership and where access is unrestricted, partially restricted or restricted. Part 1(b) seeks to protect the open character of Metropolitan 13.15 Open Land (MOL). MOL is a unique open space designation in London and is afforded the same level of protection as the Green Belt within the London Plan. Part 1(c) promotes the enhancement of the borough’s existing 13.16 open space to improve their quality and multi-functionality to serve a variety of users. This will be delivered through the provision of new outdoor sport facilities, such as playing pitches (e.g. ancillary facilities and changing rooms), outdoor gyms and multi-use games areas within existing parks (e.g. Victoria Park, Mudchute Park and Mile End Park). Proposals should also aim to incorporate the principles of Sport England’s Active Design Guide. Part 1(d) promotes the delivery of a well-connected and high 13.17 quality network of publicly accessible open spaces through new and improved green grid connections, in accordance with the Transport for London’s healthy streets initiative. This can be achieved through new planting in the public realm (including streets, trees and vegetation) and maximising opportunities to create access to nature, natural play and educational elements along the green grid as well as improved signage and posting to enhance way-finding. The Green Grid Strategy has identified a series of strategic green grid projects (as shown on Figure 12) to improve cross-borough connections and help address deficiencies across the borough as well as other parts of London. Parts 1(d) and (e) promote the provision of new publicly accessible 13.18 open spaces to serve the borough’s growing population, particularly where they are of a wider strategic importance (e.g. Lea River Park) and in ). areas of significant open space deficiency (see Figure 13 [48] 48 Publicly accessible open space deficiency is mapped using 400 metre catchment areas from parks of 1 hectare or above.", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**13.

Larger open space (i.e. one hectare and above) provision will 13.20 be secured on allocated sites (as identified in Section 4) through new development. Delivery of smaller publicly accessible open spaces such 13.21 as pocket parks and linear verges will be promoted through new development. Innovative approaches to delivering new open space (e.g. roof13.22 top gardens/greenhouses, community gardens and green/brown roofs) in these areas as well as locating parks in areas of the borough where accessibility to public open space is poor will be promoted. 140 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES Explanation Water spaces make a positive contribution to the economy, 13.25 society and the environment and should be safeguarded for waterrelated purposes with priority given to water management, improving water quality, managing land drainage, and avoiding, reducing and managing flood risk. This policy seeks to protect and enhance the borough’s valuable 13.26 network of water spaces and also ensure that they are easily accessible and provide a wide range of water-related opportunities for local communities and visitors. For the purposes of the Local Plan, water space means an area of 13.27 water (permanently or intermittently) and includes rivers, canals, docks, basins, ponds, marshland and other water bodies. Part 1(a) seeks to ensure that development does not result in 13.28 further loss or over sailing of the borough’s valuable water spaces unless it is a water-related or water-dependent use at appropriate locations. Water-dependent uses are defined as an activity which can only be conducted on, in, over or adjacent to the water because its function requires direct access to, along and across the water or involves, as an integral part of the activity, the use of the water. Appropriate infrastructure to support water-dependent uses includes: a. Walkways and slipways for pedestrians, boaters and cyclists b. Bridges and tunnels (e.g. across the rivers Lea and Thames) c. Water-based sport and leisure (e.g. sailing and kayaking) d. Security and safety (e.g. lifebuoys and other life-saving equipment) e. Water-based passengers, tourism, transport support and freight infrastructure (e.g. piers and clippers) Marine support facilities f. g. Moorings (including permanent and visitor moorings) and their support infrastructure. 142 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits In addition, other water-related uses may also be considered at 13.29 suitable locations where there is clear evidence that they are specifically designed to enhance the public access, use or enjoyment of the water space and will have a positive contribution to the character of the water space without causing any adverse negative impacts on biodiversity (e.g. activate the water space to enhance it as a waterside destination). An important consideration in decision making will be the cumulative impact of existing and proposed new water related uses in order to ensure that that there is no adverse impact on the character and openness of the borough’s water space and the amenity of surrounding residents. 13.30 Despite their urban setting and heavily modified nature, the borough’s network of rivers, canals and docks are important for biodiversity, supporting a wide range of species of wild plants and animals (including rare and protected species) and allowing people to come into contact with nature. In accordance with Part 1(b), development will be expected to preserve and enhance biodiversity and increase the resilience of wetland ecosystems. This can be achieved through a range of measures, such as the restoration and creation of priority habitats and planting native species to create more natural landscapes along the waterways, and the prevention of overspill of artificial lighting onto waterways or onto adjacent areas of soft landscaping. 13.31 Some of the borough’s water spaces are difficult to find and access from nearby transport hubs (e.g. River Lea, Shadwell Basin and West India Middle and South Docks) or have restricted and disjointed access (e.g. River Thames). Part 1(c) of the policy seeks to ensure that access to all water spaces is improved through appropriate signage for better way finding. Many of the borough’s water spaces (including Blackwall Basin, Hermitage Basin, Limehouse Basin, East India Dock Basin, Limehouse Cut Canal, Millwall inner and outer docks, Poplar Dock, St Katherine’s Dock, Wapping Canal, West India Docks and the rivers Lea and Thames) are located within or adjacent to areas of open space deficiency in access to parks. These water spaces and the adjacent land SECTION 3: POLICIES therefore provide important open space functions and make a valuable contribution to the health and well-being of communities. In delivering Part 1(d), additional opportunities will be explored to 13.32 maximise the use of the borough’s water spaces for transport and freight at suitable locations (e.g. Trinity Buoy Wharf and along the River Thames), including the introduction of additional Thames Clipper stops. Policies S.TR1 and D.TR4 provide further guidance on sustainable transport and freight. Creating and enhancing the borough’s high quality, usable 13.33 and accessible network of water spaces will be delivered through a coordinated approach with a wide range of stakeholders, including the Canal and River Trust, Port of London Authority, Inland Waterways Association, neighbouring boroughs and other relevant organisations, see Parts 1(e) and (f). This policy also recognises the importance of several 13.34 strategic documents which provide the framework for the sustainable development of the borough’s water spaces and, more specifically, the River Thames and its tributaries, see Part 1(f). a. The European Water Framework Directive provides a framework for protecting and improving the ecological quality of all water bodies. b. Following on from the European Water Framework Directive, the Thames River Basin Management Plan sets out actions to protect and enhance the river’s natural environment. c. The Thames Strategy East sets out a long term framework to guide the sustainable management of the Thames Policy Area (as shown on the Policies Map) and promotes development principles, such as greater connectivity through improved foot and cycle access to and along the River Thames and the provision of water support infrastructure (e.g. bridges, piers and flood defences, etc) which respects and contribute to the river’s character.", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**13.

It also seeks to maximise the opportunities for delivery of new open space and for enhancing accessibility and connectivity to the wider network, which is considered crucial to addressing the borough’s open space deficiency (as shown on Figure 13). Development on areas of open space will be resisted unless in the 13.36 circumstances specified in Part 2(a) and (b). The types of development that are considered to be acceptable in principle within areas of open space include changing rooms, play equipment and seating. They should be of a scale and function proportionate to the open space in which they are to be located and should be purely ancillary to it. In relation to part 1(b), there may be instances (e.g. in housing 13.37 estate regeneration schemes) where building on fragmented areas of poor quality open space enables the provision of a larger consolidated area of open space which is more usable for the local community. In these circumstances, the starting point will be no net loss of open space but if the development is resulting in an increase in population then additional open space will be required in accordance with the principles set out in Policy S.OWS1. Part 1(d) seeks to ensure that outdoor sport and recreation 13.38 facilities are protected against unjustified loss in line with the requirements set out in the National Planning Policy Framework. Part 2 seeks to promote delivery of new publicly accessible 13.39 open space and the provision of new publicly accessible open space on strategic schemes (i.e. more than 100 homes or over 10,000 square metres floorspace) where development is considered to place significant additional demand on existing publicly accessible open space, particularly in identified areas of open space deficiency (see Figure 13). Where publicly accessible open space is provided on site, it 13.40 should aim to meet the local standard of 1.2 hectares per 1000 residents (as identified in the Open Space Strategy) and be designed to support the key open space functions, as specified in Part 2 (a) to (e) in line with the All London Green Grid Supplementary Planning Guidance. Future management and maintenance of new publicly accessible open space will be secured through planning conditions or legal agreements to ensure the highest possible level of public access, function and use. Where the new publicly accessible open space is delivered to a 13.41 satisfactory standard that meets all criteria specified in Part 2, we may consider this on-site provision as payment in kind. The provision of amenity space or landscaping required as part of good design to mitigate the impact of development will not be considered as appropriate publicly accessible open space provision. The level and nature of any sports provision should take account of the recommendations set out in Sport England’s guidance and our Open Space Strategy and its associated action plan. Where on-site provision of adequate publicly accessible open 13.42 space is not possible, a contribution will be sought from the developer towards the delivery of the opportunities and the strategic projects identified in the Open Space Strategy and Green Grid Strategy in accordance with the Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document. Part 3 seeks to ensure that residential developments will not 13.43 place undue pressure on publicly accessible open space and will not be allowed to solely rely upon nearby public open space to contribute to adequate outdoor communal amenity space, including child play space in line with the principles set out in Policy D.H3. In accordance with Part 4, development will be expected to 13.44 demonstrate that it will enhance and not negatively affect the borough’s publicly accessible open space, including the Lea Valley Regional Park (consisting of East India Dock Basin and linear towpaths along the River 146 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits Lea Navigation, Hertford Union Canal and Limehouse Cut) the Lea River Park (including the Leaway) and the Transport for London’s Lea Valley Walk initiative. The Lee Valley Regional Park forms an important part of the borough’s green grid and water spaces network and has the potential to contribute to creating healthy and liveable communities, particularly where links into this network can be enhanced and complemented with new open space delivered as part of development [49] . We will work together with the Lea Valley Regional Park Authority and the Environment Agency to support proposals set out in the Tower Hamlets’ Local Biodiversity Action Plan, the Park Plan and Park Development Framework where they relate to the borough. We will also work with neighbouring authorities and relevant stakeholders to support the delivery of the Lea River Park (including the Leaway), which connects Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and the Lea Valley Regional Park to the Royal Docks and the River Thames through a new continuous walking and cycling route along the River Lea. Further development principles and guidance are included in the Lea River Park Primer and Lea River Park Design Manual. For the purposes of implementing this policy, development 13.45 would be considered to be in close proximity to the green grid where it is located within 200 metres (equivalent to around three minutes walking time) of the green grid network (see Part 5). Development sites located adjacent to or in close proximity to 13.46 the green grid (i.e. within the Green Grid Buffer Zone, (as shown on the Policies Map) – including the Lee Valley Regional Park, Lea River Park, Thames Path National Trail and canal towpaths - will be required to contribute to linking and improving the connectivity of green grid links in accordance with the Green Grid Strategy and the Mayor of London’s All London Green Grid Supplementary Planning Guidance. This should be supported with adequate signage and facilities for visitors and tourists.

Part 1 requires development to demonstrate that it will not result 13.49 in loss or covering of water space and that it will not compromise the suitability of the water space for water-related uses (as defined in Policy S.OWS2). Further water loss and over-sailing from development will be resisted throughout the borough, particularly at locations that have experienced significant water space loss, such as West India South Dock, West India Middle Dock, West India North Dock, Blackwall Basin and Poplar Dock in Canary Wharf. In line with London Plan policies and guidance, provision of 13.50 appropriate water space support infrastructure (including but not limited to: transport and essential access infrastructure into and alongside water spaces, boatyards, moorings, jetties and safety equipment) will be supported at suitable locations. Further details on infrastructure for water-related and water-dependent uses are included in Policy S.OWS2. The Infrastructure Delivery Plan provides information on the current need for some water support infrastructure (e.g. bridges). The sense of openness greatly contributes to a person’s 13.51 perception and enjoyment of water spaces. This is of particular importance in a borough like Tower Hamlets where there is a high deficiency of open space. When assessing planning applications, consideration will be given to the water coverage and human experience of the openness of water space in terms of its visibility and visual connections across the water from the surrounding public realm. SECTION 3: POLICIES Safety and public use of the borough’s water spaces will be 13.53 improved through development design which provides good pedestrian access, active frontages to improve surveillance and riparian lifesaving equipment, where appropriate. Increased appeal through active frontages will be particularly important for the docks in Canary Wharf as well as areas around Trinity Buoy Wharf, Limehouse Basin and along the River Lea which can have significant potential to attract visitors. The edges of water space are an extremely important part of the 13.54 functioning of water space as ecosystems, open space and transport networks. Development proposals must ensure that such areas are protected and provide setbacks from the edges of the water space as well as contribute to restoration following the Environment Agency’s Estuary Edges guidance. How this restoration should be undertaken will need to be considered against the functions of the water space and an appropriate balance will be sought between uses on the water space and access to and interaction with the water space and ecological enhancements in line with the Tower Hamlets Local Biodiversity Action Plan. Setbacks from waterways are also required for flood management purposes and further details outlining their use are provided in Policy D.ES4. Where setbacks are required they provide an opportunity to increase enjoyment of the waterways and should be designed to look and feel publicly accessible (e.g. through the use of signposting). The River Thames provides important additional opportunities 13.55 to that of other water spaces within the borough, acting as a transport link of strategic and historical importance. Developments in the Thames Policy Area (as identified on the Policies Map) should ensure that their use and design establishes a positive relationship with the river in accordance with the most up-to-date guidance within the Thames Policy Area (e.g. Thames Strategy East and Thames River Basin Management Plan) and supplementary planning documents (see Part 2). Public access to and along the borough’s water spaces will be 13.52 improved, particularly where access is currently restricted, including the docks around Canary Wharf (including West India Middle Dock and Blackwall Basin), the River Lea and the River Thames (e.g. the Thames Path).", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**13.

The Thames Path forms part of the National Trail. We are committed to maintaining the existing National Trail and expanding the Thames Path along the eastern part of the Isle of Dogs to connect it to the Leaway as a publicly accessible continuous route. Developments adjacent to the River Thames should contribute towards the delivery and maintenance of this route. Where the Thames Path cannot be delivered adjacent to the River Thames, due to heritage reasons, we will require the development to contribute towards the signposting, design and maintenance of an alternative route. We will work together with the Port of London Authority and 13.57 Canal and River Trust to determine the suitability of moorings (including residential and commercial moorings) on the borough’s water spaces. Key considerations in assessing the impact of mooring proposals will include: navigation, water quality, biodiversity, openness and character of the water space and surrounding area, surrounding residential amenity, waste management and air quality as well as the adequate supply of electricity provision. The Tower Hamlets Water Space Study identifies some of the locations which may be considered suitable for further development of residential moorings, including at the Regents Canal, Blackwall Basin, Poplar Dock, Milwall Inner and Outer Docks and the West India South Dock. 150 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**13.

Sustainable growth requires careful stewardship of our resources (land, water and energy) to reduce carbon emissions, improve air quality, conserve water resources, protect biodiversity and mitigate flood risk. Despite its urban character, Tower Hamlets has areas of notable 14.2 biodiversity value, including three Local Nature Reserves and 35 Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation. However, parts of the borough, including the City Fringe, Poplar and the western edge of the Isle of Dogs, . are considered to be nature deficient [50] 14.3 Parts of the borough are at potential risk of flooding. Whilst the Thames Barrier and other flood defences currently provide effective protection, their continued maintenance, along with further investment in flood defences, is required. Climate change will also have an impact on flood risk and must be considered in order to mitigate the risk of flooding for the expected lifetime of a development. The borough also has a number of critical drainage areas which are at higher risk of surface water flooding. Despite this, London has lower rainfall than the national average, whilst having a very high population density. This combination has resulted in London being declared an area of serious water stress and this trend is likely to be exacerbated by climate change [51] . SECTION 3: POLICIES Carbon emissions in the borough have been falling steadily over 14.4 recent years, but Tower Hamlets still produces the third highest level of total carbon dioxide emissions of all the boroughs in London [52] . The whole of the borough falls within an Air Quality Management 14.5 Area (as shown on the Policies Map), parts of which exceed the World Health Organisation guideline limits and European Union safe legal limits / national air quality objectives on harmful pollutants. This section contains the following policies: 14.6 z Policy S.ES1: Protecting and enhancing our environment z Policy D.ES2: Air quality z Policy D.ES3: Urban greening and biodiversity z Policy D.ES4: Flood risk z Policy D.ES5: Sustainable drainage z Policy D.ES6: Sustainable water and wastewater management z Policy D.ES7: A zero carbon borough z Policy D.ES8: Contaminated land and storage of hazardous substances z Policy D.ES9: Noise and vibration z Policy D.ES10: Overheating. 50 Tower Hamlets Green Grid Strategy (2017) 51 Securing London’s Water Future: The Mayor’s Water Strategy (GLA, 2011) 52 UK Local Authority and Regional Carbon Dioxide Emissions: 2005 – 2014 (National Statistics, 2016)", "level": 2, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**14.

Development plays a key role in improving air quality and reducing 14.8 exposure to poor air quality. Areas of sub-standard air quality are areas where nitrogen dioxide levels exceed 40 micrograms per cubic meter of air (µg/m3): the European Union legal limit / national air quality objectives. This includes areas in which the particulate (PM2.5) levels exceed 10 μg/m3 annual mean limits (World Health Organisation guideline limits). The Tower Hamlets Air Quality Action Plan identifies the ways in which development can improve air quality in the borough. 14.9 The Tower Hamlets Local Biodiversity Action Plan identifies priority species and habitats to ensure the ongoing improvement of biodiversity across the borough. The Thames River Basin Management Plan sets out objectives to protect and enhance the water bodies in the basin/catchment. Part 1(b) of the policy ensures that development contributes to meeting the objectives of these plans. In addition, to address nature deficiency and deficiency of access to nature (areas shown on the Policies Map), we aim to maximise opportunities for biodiversity in and around developments in order to deliver a net gain in biodiversity and a range of wider environmental benefits. 14.10 In recognition of the borough’s areas of flood risk, more vulnerable development should be located away from areas of flood risk, as shown on the Policies Map. As part of our commitment to reducing the risk of flooding, we will work closely with national and regional bodies and neighbouring authorities to: a. Maintain and improve the existing flood defences b. Ensure effective emergency-planning practices are in place c. Keeping up-to-date information about flood risk in the borough 152 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES d. Supporting the development of the Thames Tideway Tunnel and associated storm relief connections. Development must also address London’s water stress by 14.11 reducing water use. Development should aim to reduce carbon emissions and adhere 14.12 to the principles of the energy hierarchy set out below. a. Be lean: use less energy b. Be clean: supply energy efficiently c. Be green: use renewable energy. New development (including buildings and the spaces between 14.13 them) also needs to be planned, designed and constructed to respond to future anticipated changes in climate such as warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers and the risks associated with such changes: the urban heat island effect, heat waves, flooding and droughts. Further guidance can be found in the Sustainable Design and Construction Supplementary Planning Guidance (GLA, 2014). Development must also consider and mitigate existing 14.14 contamination as well as prevent any further contamination of water or land.", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**14.

In parts of the borough, including the City Fringe and along all major roads, the levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulates (PM2.5 and PM 10) exceed World Health Organisation guideline limits and, in the case of nitrogen dioxide, European Union safe legal limits /national air quality objectives [54] . Poor air quality has well-evidenced significant adverse effects on health. Further guidance on the ‘air quality neutral standard’ is outlined in the Sustainable Design and Construction Supplementary Planning Guidance (GLA, 2014) [55] . In those parts of the borough where air quality is below European 14.16 Union safe limits for nitrogen dioxide levels, particular focus will be placed on improving air quality, protecting users from the effects of poor air quality and protecting vulnerable uses, such as schools. Education uses covered under this policy are primary and secondary schools and does not include further or higher education facilities.

Living building elements enhance biodiversity, both directly through planting and indirectly through providing habitats [56] . They also have flood reduction, climatic and air quality benefits, helping to remove carbon dioxide from the air and reduce temperatures. In implementing Part 1(a) ‘living building’ elements need to 14.21 contribute to local biodiversity through providing priority habitats, and/ or features for priority species, as identified in the latest Tower Hamlets Local Biodiversity Action Plan. The types of ‘living building’ techniques we consider appropriate include living roofs, walls, terraces and other building greening techniques. ‘Living building’ elements should also be considered alongside the sustainable urban drainage requirements outlined in Policy D.ES5, and green grid requirements outlined in Policies S.OWS1 and D.OWS3. Providing living building elements is considered particularly beneficial in areas of sub-standard air quality or in areas at particular risk of experiencing the urban heat island effect. The risk of experiencing the ‘heat-island’ effect should be considered over the lifetime of the development. Details of ongoing maintenance of the ‘living building’ elements will also be required. According to the London Climate Change Partnership, areas at 14.22 particular risk of experiencing the urban heat island effect include the following: a. Areas of green space deficiency (see Figure 13). This includes developments within identified areas of deficiency of access to nature b. Areas of high density development with clusters of tall buildings. This includes developments within identified Tall Building Zones (see Policy D.DH6) c. Areas experiencing high levels of pollution. This includes developments within identified areas of sub-standard air quality (as shown on the Policies Map and Figure 14). In implementing Part 1(b), consideration will be given to the size, 14.23 scale and nature of the development and whether an appropriate level of provision is proposed. Even minor development, such as rear extensions, have the ability to provide biodiversity measures through items such as living roofs, walls and habitat structures (e.g. bat and bird boxes). The latest Tower Hamlets Local Biodiversity Action Plan should 14.24 give details of priority habitats and/or features for priority species (see Parts 1 and 2). Features of biodiversity or ecological value include: a. Linear corridors, such as watercourses, hedgerows and buffer zones b. Veteran trees c. Old hedges , London [58] or national [59] d. Habitats or species identified as local [57] priorities, and features which might support such species. Where geographically relevant, the Thames River Basin Management Plan objectives should also be incorporated. Due to the environmental importance of trees, at least a ‘one14.25 for-one’ replacement rate is required for any trees affected by a development (see Part 1). Where we are convinced these cannot be incorporated on site, we will consider the provision of a replacement tree on a suitable site, as close to the development as possible. We will also expect developments to incorporate additional trees, wherever 56 Tower Hamlet Local Biodiversity Action Plan (2015) 57 Tower Hamlets Local Biodiversity Action Plan (2015) 58 London Biodiversity Action Plan (GLA, 2007) 59 Species of Principal Importance in England identified under section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act (2016) 158 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits possible. Their location must be carefully considered to ensure there is no adverse impact on overshadowing, wind effects, air quality, ecology or flood risk. Where trees are proposed along the river corridor, their positioning must be carefully considered to ensure there are no adverse impacts on ecology or flood risk. A buffer of at least five metres is suggested between the bank and tree. We will take a ‘right tree for the right site’ approach which takes account of historic context, availability of space, soil conditions, wildlife value, potential improvements to air and soil quality, provision of shade and reducing the effects of and adapting to climate change. This will need to be evidenced in the ecology assessment. ‘Potentially invasive non-native species’ include plants listed on 14.26 Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) and plants identified as species of concern by the London Invasive Species Initiative. In addition, planting schemes should be selected according to their suitability for local growing conditions (soil, temperature ranges, rainfall, sunlight and shade), their ability to attract wildlife (e.g. nectar rich planting) and to conserve water. Planting along river corridors should only include native species. This will need to be evidenced in the ecology statement. Part 4 seeks to protect the integrity of any European or nationally 14.27 designated site of nature conservation importance. There are no such sites within Tower Hamlets, but development may have the potential to adversely impact sites beyond its boundary – such as the Epping Forest Special Area of Conservation and the Lea Valley Special Protection Area - through air pollution and/or increased visitor pressure. Where the application is of such a scale, location or nature as to potentially have such an effect on a European site, applicants should seek advice from Natural England as to whether a Habitat Regulations Assessment SECTION 3: POLICIES would be required. The assessment will need to demonstrate that the development will not adversely impact on the integrity of the European site. Proposals will be resisted where they will have significant adverse impact on European sites. Part 5 seeks to protect locally designated Site of Importance 14.28 for Nature Conservation (SINCs) and important species. The presence of protected species is a material planning consideration where a development is likely to result in harm to a habitat or species. Priority species are those identified in the Tower Hamlets Local Biodiversity Action Plan, Species of Conservation Concern in London and Species of Principal Importance in England, as identified under section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act. If a SINC or a protected or priority species is likely to be affected, an ecology assessment will be required. The ecology assessment should include: a. Information assessing the characteristics and situation of the site b. Details on how the proposals will protect, replace and enhance existing biodiversity on the proposed site, including measures for wildlife habitats and features aimed at particular species. Applications should also detail how recommendations are being 14.29 included in the development proposals. Should the ecology assessment indicate an adverse impact on the biodiversity interest of the site, this will be managed using the hierarchical approach outlined in Part 4. Should compensation be sought, it would be at the level required to adequately offset the impact on the SINC or protected/priority species, through the provision of an alternative site or habitat.", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**14.

The flood risk zones are shown on the Policies Map and Figure 15. New development must not increase the risk of flooding and must provide mitigation measures to reduce their impact on flood risk, including enabling the repair and further delivery of flood defences. 14.31 For Parts 1 and 4 of the policy, the vulnerability of uses is defined within the National Planning Policy Framework and are contained in the latest Strategic Flood Risk Assessment. Highly vulnerable uses include a self-contained basement without internal access to the upper floors above breach level. More vulnerable uses include a basement with access to upper floors above the breach level. All basement developments are required to conduct a basement impact assessment to demonstrate that proposals safeguard structural stability, are safe from a flood risk perspective, and will not have any adverse impacts on local hydrogeology. It should take account of the guidance provided in the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment. 14.32 In order to address Parts 2 and 3, the flood risk assessment should also: Developments within site allocations (see Section 4) which seek 14.33 to deliver their allocated use do not have to undertake a sequential test, . even if the site is in flood zone 2 or 3, as required under Part 3(a) [60] Flood resistance refers to constructing a building in such a way 14.34 as to prevent floodwater entering the building and damaging its fabric. Flood resilience refers to constructing a building in such a way that, although flood water may enter the building, its impact is minimised (i.e. no permanent damage is caused, structural integrity is maintained and drying and cleaning are facilitated). Part 5 should also be considered alongside Policy D.OWS4. The 14.35 requirement to include an adequate buffer zone (see Part 6) between waterways and developments applies to main rivers only (as identified in the Tower Hamlets Strategic Flood Risk Assessment). It is to enable sustainable and cost effective flood risk management, including upgrading of river walls and embankments. a. be proportionate with the degree of flood risk that the proposed development is exposed to and may exacerbate b. consider the cumulative impact of existing and future development, and c. demonstrate where adjacent to flood defences that development will safeguard and maintain the existing flood defences over its lifetime. 60 The sequential test has already been undertaken in the Tower Hamlets Site Allocation Sequential and Exceptions Tests (2017). 162 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**14.

This can include: a. Raising existing flood defences to the required levels in preparation for future climate change impacts or otherwise demonstrating how tidal flood defences can be raised in the future, through submission of plans and cross-sections of the proposed raising (in particular to demonstrate that the development does not preclude future raising of the defence in line with the Thames Estuary 2100 Plan) b.

This arises following periods of intense rainfall when the volume and intensity of a rainfall event exceeds the capacity of the drainage system, resulting in localised flooding. Current critical drainage areas in the borough are in the Isle of Dogs, with other smaller areas of high surface water flood risk found throughout the borough. These are shown on the Policies Map and Figure 15. In order to reduce the amount of water being discharged from 14.39 sites, this policy requires development to reduce the run-off from hard surfacing. When assessing the requirements of this policy consideration will be given to the size, scale and nature of the development and whether relative provision has been made. Even minor development (e.g. rear extensions) have the ability to provide sustainable drainage measures. Applicants are strongly encouraged to consider the requirements 14.40 for sustainable urban drainage systems at the earliest opportunity, as this will enable their more effective integration and provision. Sustainable urban drainage systems should also be considered alongside the ‘living building’ requirements outlined in Policy D.ES3, and green grid requirements outlined in Policy S.OSW1, as sustainable urban drainage systems can also have biodiversity and urban greening benefits. Applicants should demonstrate that they have considered 14.41 different types of sustainable urban drainage systems, their ability to remove pollutants, their capacity and future maintenance.

They should not be used for foul discharges or trade effluent, and may not be suitable within source protection zone 1 [61] . 61 The Environment Agency has defined source protection zones: these are available to view from their website. 166 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES Explanation London is an area of serious water stress [62] . Developments 14.45 should therefore seek to reduce the pressure on the fresh and waste water systems through increasing water efficiency. In recognition of this, Part 1 requires all new residential developments to meet the national higher standard of 105 litres per person per day. BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) applies to non-residential developments, residential development arising from conversions and changes of use. This method provides a holistic assessment of the environmental sustainability of a development. Measures to achieve Parts 1 and 2 could include the installation 14.46 of water efficient fittings and appliances (which can help reduce energy consumption as well as water consumption) and by capturing and reusing rain water and grey water on site. Major developments and high or intense water use developments, such as hotels, hostels and student housing, should include a grey water and rainwater harvesting system. Where such a system is not feasible or practical, development must demonstrate to our satisfaction that this is the case. Developments are expected to submit a water efficiency calculator to demonstrate how they have met this requirement. 14.47 In relation to Part 3, major development (as defined in the glossary in Appendix 1) is required to demonstrate that there is adequate capacity both on and off site to serve the development. Developers should contact Thames Water as early as possible (preferably in advance of the submission of a planning application) to discuss their development proposals and intended delivery programme to assist with identifying any potential water and wastewater network reinforcement requirements in order for Thames Water to undertake the necessary upgrades. Where there is a capacity constraint phasing conditions may be applied to any approval to ensure that any necessary infrastructure upgrades are delivered ahead of the occupation of the relevant phase of development. 62 Water Stressed Area – Final Classification (Environment Agency, 2013)", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**14.

Currently, Tower Hamlets is the third worst performing borough within London [63] . Since 2010, Tower Hamlets has only achieved a 22% reduction against this target [64] . This policy maintains our long term trajectory which has required progressive reductions in carbon emissions from developments. This follows the London Plan’s approach and is endorsed in the Housing Strategic Planning Guidance (GLA, 2016) [65] . Parts 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the policy seek to ensure that all new 14.49 developments (including non-residential development) in Tower Hamlets contribute towards reducing carbon emissions. The policy also recognises that on-site carbon reductions have a greater impact on reducing carbon emissions than contributions in lieu. Funds raised through carbon offsetting (e.g. retrofitting) are spent on priorities outlined in the Tower Hamlets Carbon Offset Study (2016), as supported in part 4. Further information on carbon offsetting is available in the Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document. In relation to Part 1, the improvements in carbon dioxide emission 14.50 reductions within new build developments are based on building regulations requirements. Should the building regulations be updated during the lifetime of this plan, we will provide an update on the onsite reduction standards required. The requirement to reach zero carbon will remain. For refurbishment schemes, the baseline should be determined by modelling using building regulation compliance software to determine a building emission rate/dwelling emission rate of the regulated carbon dioxide emissions from the existing building before refurbishment [66] . SECTION 3: POLICIES Energy assessments should be informed by preliminary 14.51 standard assessment procedures for residential developments or the national calculation method for non-residential development. Energy assessments should detail the measures included in the development and the carbon dioxide emission savings achieved at the time of implementing the relevant planning permission. To ensure we achieve our sustainability objectives, energy assessments for non-major development will also be sought. In relation to Part 2, developments should consider how the 14.52 design, layout, orientation, insulation materials and other sustainable construction techniques can contribute towards maximising energy efficiency. In addition, developments should implement at least the 14.53 minimum standards set out in BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) which applies to non-residential developments, non-self-contained housing and residential development arising from conversions and changes of use. This method provides a holistic assessment of the environmental sustainability of a development. The Home Quality Mark is one way of demonstrating the standard of a new residential dwelling, which includes measures for low carbon dioxide, sustainable materials, good air quality and natural daylight. We strongly encourage schemes to use the Home Quality Mark. Developments which are unable to meet these standards must provide evidence demonstrating the constraints and provide an alternative assessment against the requirements in the GLA’s Sustainable Design and Construction Supplementary Planning Guidance. If BREEAM/Home Quality Mark/Sustainable Design and Construction Supplementary Planning Guidance is replaced or amended during the lifetime of the plan, the equivalent replacement requirements will be applied, subject to discussion with our sustainability service. 63 UK Local Authority and Regional Carbon Dioxide Emissions 2005 – 2014 (National Statistics, 2016) 64 Tower Hamlets Carbon Policy Evidence Base (2016) 65 The importance and viability of this approach has been detailed in the Tower Hamlets Carbon Policy Evidence Base (2016). 66 The implementation dates for the requirements in Part 1 are from 1 October 2016 for residential developments and from 1 October 2019 for non-residential developments.", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**14.

We will seek contributions from developers towards the costs of 14.56 the decentralised energy network in line with the avoided costs of their own plant installation. Applicants will be expected to demonstrate the low air quality impacts of any decentralised energy network. In order to address Part 5, the expected carbon reductions should 14.57 be demonstrated within an energy assessment. 67 Please note: a district heating system is a type of decentralised heating network. 170 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES Explanation Part 1 of this policy provides additional guidance on protecting 14.58 health of the borough’s residents and workers and the environment from contaminants and hazardous substances. This should be read in conjunction with the guidance set out in the London Plan (GLA, 2016). Contaminated land is land that has been polluted with harmful 14.59 substances to the point where it now poses an unacceptable risk to health and the environment. Tower Hamlets has a history of industrial land uses and we want to ensure that the impacts of these past and current land uses do not affect the health of people and the environment. We keep and update a public register of contaminated land (which is available from our website) and any site included in the register or any site which is potentially contaminated will be required to carry out a site investigation and agree a scheme of mitigation with us to ensure that contaminated land issues are considered at the planning application stage. 14.60 A verification report will be required through condition in order to provide confirmation that the remediation work has been undertaken properly in line with best practice. Part 2 of the policy relates to the management of hazardous 14.61 substances which are outlined in the Planning (Hazardous Substances) Regulations (2015). There are a small number of listed hazardous installations in or near to the borough. Hazardous substances are also controlled by the need for a separate hazardous substances consent. As such, it will be necessary to demonstrate that any developments which involve hazardous substances would not cause a significant hazard to the health and well-being of local residents or to the local environment. We will apply the Health and Safety Executive’s land use 14.62 planning methodology in the event of a proposal being located near to a hazardous installation.

Applicants are advised to speak to our environmental health service and the Environment Agency, where relevant. 172 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits Explanation This policy seeks to manage noise and vibration from new 14.64 development and manage existing sources of noise on sensitive development. 14.65 Noise and vibration can have a major effect on local amenity and well-being: the World Health Organisation, for example, states that excessive noise can seriously harm human health, disturb sleep and have cardiovascular and behavioural effects. The increasingly high-density and mixed-use nature of 14.66 development in Tower Hamlets means it is essential that building design and use minimises noise pollution and disturbance. Part 1 therefore sets out measures to minimise noise from new development and separate noise-sensitive uses such as housing, hospitals and schools from existing noise sources to protect the amenity and well-being of the area. In particular, the noise assessment should include the following. 14.67 a. Source and absolute level of the noise together with the time of day it SECTION 3: POLICIES 14.68 Where the avoidance of noise conflicts is impractical, mitigation measures such as effective sound-proofing for noise attenuation (e.g. noise absorbing cladding) and restrictions on operating hours will be implemented through appropriate planning conditions. There have been a number of examples across London of long14.69 standing entertainment venues closing or becoming at risk of closure due to a combination of factors, including noise complaints from new residents and venues being purchased for redevelopment (particularly for housing). This has implications for the long-term future of London’s creative and cultural sector which has an impact not just on residents but also its tourism potential [68] . Part 2 uses the agent of change principle to seek to reduce this phenomenon. This principle may also apply to other noise-generating uses, such as industrial uses. Applicants must submit detailed noise assessments and demonstrate that noise levels within the proposed development emitted from nearby uses would be at an acceptable level. Where we are not satisfied that the operations of nearby uses would not be compromised, applications will be refused. Part 3 sets out that heating and ventilation plants should be 14.70 designed so that they do not adversely affect nearby amenities, including open spaces which are valued for their quiet environment. Appendix 6 provides further guidance on how this policy will be 14.71 implemented. occurs b. For non-continuous sources of noise, the number of noise events, and the frequency and pattern of occurrence of the noise c. Pitch and tone of the noise d. The cumulative impacts of more than one source should be taken into account along with the extent to which the source of noise is intermittent and of limited duration e. In cases where existing noise sensitive locations already experience high noise levels, a development that is expected to cause even a small increase in the overall noise level may result in a significant adverse effect. 68 London’s Grassroots Music Venues Rescue Plan (GLA, 2015)", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**14.

Subsequent methods include thermal mass and high ceilings, passive and mechanical ventilation and low-carbon active cooling systems. Explanation Climate change is causing increased occurrence of overheating, 14.72 which can cause significant discomfort to residents and building users. Relying on air-conditioning systems to cool buildings can be very energy intensive, ineffective and can also cause discomfort to building users. Large developments in particular have the potential to alter the local climate. For example, a light coloured building that reflects heat will stay cool on the inside and the outside, whereas a dark building will absorb heat during the day to raise internal temperatures and slowly release this heat as the temperature cools keeping the local air temperature warmer. Internal air-conditioning systems also produce heat which increases the outside temperature and adds to the heat island effect. Major development schemes are expected to evidence 14.73 compliance with this policy within their design and access statements. Details should include the measures used to avoid overheating (including overheating analysis against a mid-range climate scenario for the 2030s) and excessive heat generation. This should look at not only the physical form of the building but also the operation of the building. This policy should be read alongside the London Plan (GLA, 14.74 2016), which sets out a cooling hierarchy that indicates the cooling methods to be used in the design process, starting with minimising internal heat generation and the amount of heat entering a building in the summer through energy efficient design, including orientation, 174 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**14.

{"id": "ef80dfe6-2eb7-48d0-a88a-d4fa82539a1f", "title": "**15. Managing our waste **", "content": "Introduction The management of waste is one of the most pressing issues 15.1 facing Tower Hamlets. The borough will have significant growth in the coming decades and with this comes a greater need to reduce, recycle and recover more waste and divert it away from landfill. Tower Hamlets is a unitary waste planning authority, waste 15.2 collection authority and waste disposal authority. In our capacity as a waste planning authority, we have a statutory duty to prepare a waste local plan in line with legislation [69] . This is being fulfilled through the inclusion of waste policies in the Local Plan [70] . 15.3 The Local Plan must identify sufficient opportunities to meet the identified needs of an area for the management of waste, aiming to drive waste management up the waste hierarchy (see Figure 16). We have to plan for seven waste streams [71], including household, business and construction waste. In particular, the London Plan requires boroughs to identify existing facilities and suitable land to provide enough capacity to manage the tonnages of household and business waste apportioned in the London Plan (GLA, 2016). This policy is to enable London to be net self-sufficient in managing these waste streams by 2026. Tower Hamlets has been apportioned the following tonnes of waste: SECTION 3: POLICIES Table 4: Housing, commercial and industrial waste requirements |Col1|2021|2026|2031|2036| |||||| |Household and commercial/ industrial waste arisings (Tonnes per annum)|248,000|252,000|256,000|261,000| |London Plan apportionment (Tonnes per annum)|252,000|302,000|307,000|313,000| 15.4 The apportionment figures are higher than the total amount of waste predicted to arise in the borough. The London Plan is currently being reviewed and the borough’s apportionment targets may change as a result. Achieving these targets presents a particular challenge because parts of the borough is densely built-up and there are competing pressures from higher value land uses such as housing and employment. There is not enough capacity within existing waste facilities 15.5 in the borough to meet our waste needs. To meet the apportionment targets for household and business waste, Tower Hamlets will safeguard existing waste sites (Policy S.MW1.1) and identify land suitable for new waste facilities under Policy S.MW1. It has been calculated that between 3.65 and 5.27 hectares of land is required to meet the capacity gap up to 2036, and it is estimated that 5.28 hectares of land will come forward within the areas of search for new waste sites (see Policy S.MW1) through business turnover and vacancies [72] . The borough is not allocating individual sites for waste but identifying areas within which individual sites could come forward; this approach is supported by both national policy and the waste industry. The total amount of suitable industrial land in the borough is just under 22 hectares. We will continue to monitor the amount of land capable of providing new waste capacity over the course of the Local Plan period. *Source: London Plan (GLA, 2016)* 69 Article 28 of the Waste Framework Directive (2008) 70 A waste data study has been produced to support these policies (Tower Hamlets Waste Management Evidence Base Review, 2017). 71 Municipal/household waste; commercial/industrial waste; construction/demolition waste; low level; radioactive waste; agricultural waste; hazardous waste; and waste water waste. 72 Tower Hamlets Waste Management Evidence Base Review (2017)", "level": 2, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**15.

Areas of search are not solely designated for waste management purposes and are also suitable, in principle, for other uses that are considered appropriate for their respective policy designations. There is also a capacity gap for construction, demolition and 15.8 excavation waste in the borough. Around 80% of this waste is currently managed on site and 70% of the remainder goes to landfill. Through Policy S.MW1, Tower Hamlets is seeking to increase the proportion of construction, demolition and excavation waste which is reused and recycled to 95% by 2020, in line with the London Plan. Nevertheless, some construction, demolition and excavation waste will continue to be exported to landfill in the wider south east region throughout the plan period and we will liaise with recipient waste planning authorities on an on-going basis to monitor these waste movements. Tower Hamlets is also required to plan for hazardous waste, waste 15.9 water, agricultural waste and low-level radioactive waste. The evidence concludes that no additional facilities are required within the borough for these waste streams because they are only produced in very small quantities and/or they are managed at specialist facilities outside the borough. Any proposals for new or extended waste facilities in Tower 15.10 Hamlets will be assessed against criteria in the National Planning Policy for Waste, the London Plan and Local Plan policies. The London Legacy Development Corporation is the planning authority for part of the borough of Tower Hamlets but it does not have a separate apportionment. We are therefore planning for waste across all of its administrative area. We will continue to work closely with the London Legacy Development Corporation on delivering our strategic plan for waste. Our duties as a waste collection authority and waste disposal 15.11 authority include helping households to prevent waste as well as reuse items and recycle as much waste as possible. The London Plan has set a target for London as a whole to exceed 50% in recycling/composting levels by 2020 and 60% by 2031. It also sets a target of recycling and composting at least 70% of London’s commercial and industrial waste by 2020, maintaining these levels to 2031. Whilst London boroughs have 176 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits not been set individual targets for recycling these waste streams, Tower Hamlets is working towards meeting the London-wide target. The design of new developments are required to ensure integrated waste collection and bulking systems are included which contribute to the borough’s ability to implement the waste hierarchy and increase recycling/ composting rates (see Policy D.MW3). The London Plan is seeking to move towards a future where 15.12 goods are designed to be reused and recycled and very little waste will require disposal in the future (a ‘circular economy’). Tower Hamlets will contribute to this approach in various ways (e.g. new developments will be required to recycle and reuse construction materials – see Policy S.MW1).

Meeting this need will require both waste facilities on existing 15.15 sites (operational and non-operational) and new facilities in areas of search and other suitable locations which comply with the criteria set out in Policy D.MW2. Waste facilities within the areas of search will be directed towards the most suitable locations within these areas to make sure that they are as far away as possible from sensitive receptors (such as residential uses, schools and health facilities) and/or mitigation measures are provided to ensure any significant detrimental environmental and amenity impacts can be adequately addressed. Where existing facilities can be enhanced to maximise their use, this will be encouraged. The London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) is the 15.16 planning authority for those sites and areas of search within its boundary (as shown in Schedules 2 and 4). The LLDC Local Plan (2015-2031) safeguards existing waste sites (listed in Schedule 2) and identifies areas of employment land suitable for waste uses (listed in Schedule 4). To secure the delivery of an effective waste plan for the borough, Tower Hamlets and the LLDC agree that the area of search listed in Schedule 4 is potentially suitable for waste management use. Acceptability of proposals for waste management uses in those locations will be determined with reference to policies within the LLDC Local Plan and any other relevant material considerations that apply to that proposal. Any applications for planning permission in these locations will need to be submitted to the LLDC as the local planning authority governing the area. Some existing safeguarded waste sites (McGrath House and Ailsa 15.17 Street) are within areas of regeneration and may be released for other uses, providing the requirements set out within Policy S.MW1 (see Part 4) are met [74] . Compensatory capacity will be sought which is equivalent or 15.18 greater than the maximum annual throughput over the last five years, as per the Environment Agency’s Waste Data Interrogator. Compensatory provision should be provided locally. The area of search for a replacement site or increased capacity within an existing facility should be within Tower Hamlets in the first instance, or failing that, elsewhere in London. Compensatory provision will usually be secured through conditions and/ or a legal agreement at the planning permission stage. Competition for land means the borough has to look beyond 15.19 traditional industrial locations when seeking space for waste facilities. There is an opportunity for innovative technologies to be incorporated into new development to manage some of the waste generated over its lifetime. Part 7 of the policy therefore allows modern waste facilities to be integrated within suitable new development outside the areas of search. Small scale facilities which come forward will be assessed on a case by-case basis against criteria in Policy D.MW2 and regional and national policies. On-site materials processing systems for food are an important 15.20 aspect to consider in this borough due to the particular challenges to collection services within blocks of flats. The principle of these systems is two-fold: a. To carry out preliminary processing of raw materials at source, thereby reducing the tonnage and volume of solid waste to be managed and the subsequent burden on collection services 74 The McGrath site at Hepscott Road in Fish Island is also a site allocation within the LLDC Local Plan for mixed-use development. There are plans to move the operations at the facility to another site within London and the Greater London Authority have confirmed that this approach is in line with London Plan policies. Ailsa Street is located within Polar Riverside Housing Zone. 180 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES b. To make use of valuable end products such as unlocking the energy held within the waste material itself. There are a number of pieces of equipment, which may provide 15.21 appropriate on-site waste processing including, but not limited to, micro anaerobic digesters. 15.22 The flexibility of these systems is such that it reduces the need to separate collections of food waste to be carried out within the development and thereby reducing vehicle movements. Where systems such as anaerobic digesters are proposed, it will be the responsibility of the managing agent to maintain the system/facility. An agreement will also need to be made with us with regards to how the waste is accounted for in terms of contributing to our apportionment targets prior to permission being granted. Integrated waste collection systems are also required for new 15.23 developments under Policy D.MW3. We will also consider the allocation of community infrastructure levy contributions towards provision of strategic waste management facilities. For Part 8 of the policy, developers should submit a plan for 15.24 on-site waste to demonstrate how much construction, demolition and excavation waste will be reused and recycled, taking account of the London Plan target of 95%. The sustainable transportation of waste (by water and rail) will be assessed as part of Policy D.MW2, see Part 1(f).

New waste management facilities will be directed towards existing 15.27 safeguarded sites and areas of search (as set out in Policy S.MW1). In other locations, such facilities will still be expected to meet the criteria set out in Policy D.MW2 as well as any other relevant policies within the plan. Developments providing additional waste management capacity 15.28 will be encouraged to co-locate alongside other waste facilities and other compatible uses without having any significant detrimental impacts on the amenity and function of the immediate and surrounding area to optimise the potential of sites and address the intensification of land uses, as per Part 1(d) . The types of waste technology that will be suitable will depend 15.29 on the nature and scale of the proposed scheme and the characteristics of the site and its surroundings, as required under Part 1(e). Broad types of facility suitable for each area of search are set out in the schedule of areas in Policy S.MW1. These are likely to be small-scale facilities due to the constrained nature of the borough. 182 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES Part 1(f) seeks to ensure applicants demonstrate that 15.30 opportunities to transport both construction and operational waste from the site via rail and water are explored (including shared facilities at existing railheads, wharves and depots) as a means to reduce congestion and vehicular movements on the road network. Information on sustainable transportation of waste should be submitted as part of the planning application, alongside details of re-use and recycling of waste arising during the construction phase in line with Policy S.MW1 (see Part 8). Part 1(i) seeks to mitigate adverse air quality impacts associated 15.31 with waste facilities. Waste management facilities should be enclosed and covered on all vertical sides with small access and egress points, fitted with fast-acting doors, and incorporate an air filtering system to reduce airborne particulate concentrations in and outside of the building in line with Environment Agency advice. This provides an effective way of controlling dust and particulate pollution within waste developments. In cases where enclosure is not possible, proposals must provide details of proposed measures demonstrating how the control measures can adequately mitigate these impacts. Operators will be expected to obtain the appropriate Environment Agency permits and meet the conditions of those permits. In order to minimise the impact on climate change, waste 15.32 management facilities should incorporate opportunities to be attached to the district heating network and/or incorporate opportunities for energy recovery and combined heat and power, see Part 1(j).

It is also intended to increase the amount of waste which can be recycled and composted from all developments, and to improve waste collection systems in developments with communal waste facilities. Tower Hamlets is working towards meeting the London Plan target of recycling/composting 50% of household waste by 2020 and 60% by 2031. In 2015, only 27% of household waste was reused, recycled or composted in Tower Hamlets and this needs to increase. This policy seeks to ensure that dry recyclables, organics and 15.34 residual waste can be segregated, and for residential developments bulked, at source within new developments to: a. minimise transport movements from waste collection operations b. minimise the financial and operational burden on existing waste collection system c. maximise efficient use of collection resources d. encourage recycling behaviour by residents and reduce contamination of recyclables collected, and e. make a positive impact on the quality of the street scene. 15.35 Incorporating sufficient waste storage capacity within new developments should be done from the outset to avoid capacity shortfalls or inadequate services. Applicants will need to forecast how much organic, recyclable and residual waste will be generated when the development is occupied and demonstrate that sufficient space has been allocated to the storage and/or bulking of this waste in both individual units and for the development as a whole. Tower Hamlets is seeking to move away from the traditional waste 15.36 storage methods, such as standard wheeled bins, bagged collections and Euro bin containers, towards central bulking systems particularly for residential developments that require communal waste collection facilities. Using larger containers than standard bins and communal Euro bins, means more waste can be stored before needing collection and more waste can be collected in a single round. As a general rule, all of the systems using bulk containers allow waste to be stored in a smaller footprint than standard communal Euro bins. The location of storage containers should be chosen to maximise operational convenience and minimise environmental, amenity and transport impacts. Under Part 2 of the policy, new major residential developments will 15.37 be expected to incorporate on-site waste collection systems that do not incorporate the traditional storage and collection and are compatible with our waste collection services. Such systems could include compactors, underground storage containers, vacuum systems and automated waste collection systems. These systems require land to be set aside to store bulked waste materials, with the size and footprint of the space varying from system to system. Preference should be given to systems that can provide for a weekly collection service as a minimum and can collect organic wastes separately or facilitate onsite composting. Applicants should discuss options with our team that manages waste collection prior to the submission of an application. 184 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES In instances where it is not practicable or we consider it 15.38 inappropriate for non-traditional waste collection systems to be incorporated within the development, the developer or managing agent will have to provide adequate space as well as collection containers that are in accordance with our waste management requirements set out in Appendix 4. Planning applications should clearly set out the access route of 15.39 the occupiers and the servicing vehicles, including a clear swept path in accordance with our waste collection specifications, and access arrangements to container stores. The waste storage area must be designed to ensure that refuse vehicles are able to enter and exit the highway in a forward gear and perform all collection activities within the curtilage of the site.

However, planned growth in new homes and jobs, coupled with London’s overall growth, will significantly increase resident, commuter and freight movement within and through the borough. This will create further pressure on the transport network which is already at or close to saturation in some parts of the borough at peak times, as well as adversely affect air quality and the natural environment. As a result, congestion and overcrowding of the transport 16.2 network are amongst the most significant challenges facing Tower Hamlets, which have the potential to significantly affect development density and economic activity in the borough. Growth is dependent on the successful implementation of a first-class sustainable transport network to move people, goods and services. Planned improvements will go some way to alleviate pressure on the existing network, but recent studies have identified that further investment in infrastructure will be required to support the level of growth which is expected to come forward during the plan period [75] . In addition, the health implications of physical inactivity is also an important local issue, which the promotion of active travel can help to address in accordance with the Mayor of London’s ‘healthy streets’ initiative. 75 Tower Hamlets Strategic Transport Assessment (2016) These factors underscore the importance of delivering a more 16.3 connected and efficient transport network across Tower Hamlets that supports the population, reduces the need to travel and incentivises a modal shift to cycling, walking and public transport. Development must manage its impact on the entire network to ensure it contributes positively to the health and well-being of residents, employees and visitors across the borough.

This correlates with travel-to-work data which indicates that residents favour sustainable modes, such as public transport (60%), walking or cycling (26%). The level of journeys to work by car, at 12%, is lower than the London average, at 30% [77] . This reinforces the need for developers to prioritise sustainable travel in the design and delivery of their schemes, particularly walking, cycling and public transport, helping to relieve congestion, reduce air pollution and improve journey times. This policy seeks to manage growth to ensure it does not 16.7 increase traffic congestion and crowding on public transport due to trip generation from developments as well as through-trips. The location of development close to services and amenities; integration with the transport network; prioritising the most sustainable forms of travel; and facilitating and enabling behaviour change away from car use are crucial factors in accommodating the predicted population and economic changes over the plan period. Part 1(a) promotes walking, cycling and public transport as a 16.8 primary means of travelling. In order to ensure compliance with green grid policies (S.OWS1 and D.OWS3), development should incorporate an improved pedestrian and cycling environment that is safe, accessible and permeable both within the borough and into neighbouring boroughs. It also identifies the necessity to link development to the borough’s strategic walk network and cycling network in accordance with the borough’s adopted cycle strategy, particularly strategic cycle routes, as well as the need to improve access to river transport (see Figure 17), where possible. 76 Travel in London, Report 9 (Transport for London, 2016) - 2015/16 figure 77 Travel in London, Report 9 (Transport for London, 2016) - 2015/16 figure SECTION 3: POLICIES Part 1(b) ensures that development supports the use of and 16.9 connects to public transport, cycling and walking facilities that surround the site. The design, management and operation of a development should encourage its users to travel in a sustainable manner; it should also be permeable and provide links to existing or planned infrastructure as well as relevant on-site infrastructure, such as bicycle storage, workplace showers and changing facilities. 16.10 Part 1(c) identifies the need for development to be located in an area appropriate to the trips it generates. The scale of any development must reflect the level of public transport available. Transport for London (TfL) has mapped the Public Transport Accessibility Levels (PTAL) across the whole of London; this is a measure of accessibility to the public transport network. In Tower Hamlets, ratings range from highly accessible areas – such as Canary Wharf, Whitechapel, Bethnal Green, Bow and Mile End - to areas with lower levels of public transport accessibility, including parts of the Lower Lea Valley. The scale of development should also have regard to the town centre hierarchy set out in Policy S.TC1, whereby development densities should consider the availability of nearby shops, services and amenities, thereby reducing the need to travel. Part 1(d) seeks to ensure that development does not cause 16.11 an unduly detrimental impact to the safety and efficient operations of existing transport networks, once appropriate mitigation measures have been taken into account. In particular, it is important that development does not: a. compromise the safety of the highway user and/or the ability of public transport providers to safely operate services which includes consideration of adequate driver welfare facilities and bus stands b. increase demand on the borough’s transport networks beyond operational limits and/or capacity", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**16.

Development is expected to be well-integrated with the public 16.12 transport network and contribute to its efficient running and service improvements. Developers should ensure they engage early with relevant bodies (e.g. Transport for London) in order to establish the likely impacts and/or appropriate mitigation measures to be funded through developer contributions in accordance with Policy D.SG5. 16.13 Part 2 identifies the role of development in supporting improvements and enhancements to the borough’s transport and freight infrastructure (including safeguarded wharves and consolidation centres). Applicants should work with us to support planned and future transport initiatives that underpin new growth; and any development that adversely affects or planned infrastructure improvements will not be supported. We will work in partnership with neighbouring boroughs, Transport 16.14 for London and other agencies (e.g. Highways England) to understand and address the future transport needs of the borough. The list below sets out a number of planned interventions that are required to support the borough’s transport network [78] . z Delivery of the Elizabeth line z Enhancements to bus services and the Dockland Light Railway z Improved river services and potential new piers at Wapping, Canary Wharf East and Trinity Buoy Wharf z New cycle infrastructure, including the Mayor of London’s cycle hire network z New pedestrian and cycle connections, including a new pedestrian bridge and cycle crossing between Canary Wharf and Rotherhithe and other river crossings. 78 These are identified in the Tower Hamlets Strategic Transport Assessment (2016). The list is not exhaustive and new interventions will arise 16.15 from other transport strategies and assessments alongside regional policies, such as the Mayor of London’s Vision for Cycling in London, the Mayor of London’s Transport Strategy and Transport for London’s own infrastructure delivery plans. Development may also be required to contribute financially towards new transport infrastructure and improvements in accordance with Policy D.SG1. 190 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits Explanation This policy seeks to address the impact that development has 16.16 (both individually and cumulatively) on the transport network, particularly issues of congestion, air quality, severance, safety and/or accessibility for cyclists and pedestrians. In doing so, it sets out how development should accurately and robustly assess the severity of impact it has on existing transport infrastructure and services, including the approach taken to mitigate any adverse impact on capacity, connectivity and congestion. Current congestion levels in many parts of the borough are 16.17 severe and the interconnectedness of the highway network - whether local or strategic – plays a significant role in contributing to this congestion. A development’s impact on congestion is not just a matter of building size but depends on its location, use, design, density and operational factors (for instance, a relatively small development could be judged to have a severe impact if it generates a high number of vehicle trips and/or is in a sensitive location). Given the significant capacity constraints on the public transport and highway network, any development that generates a net increase in vehicle trips has the potential to have a severe impact on the safety and operation of this network within Tower Hamlets. SECTION 3: POLICIES Part 1 seeks to ensure applications provide an independent, 16.18 objective and accurate transport assessment or transport statement appropriate to the scale of development. A transport assessment or statement must be prepared in accordance with the most up-to-date guidance from Transport for London. The level of detail required will be dependent on the type and scale of the development. Applicants/ developers should seek pre-application advice to determine whether a transport assessment or statement will be required. A transport assessment should be submitted with a draft construction management and logistics plan and a delivery and servicing plan. 16.19 A transport statement is a simpler document that identifies the impact and assesses its significance in conjunction with more modest mitigation measures; therefore, it is appropriate for smaller developments. A transport statement may require a construction management and logistics plan or a delivery and servicing plan depending on the type of land use and its location; this should also be established in conjunction with our transport and development management teams at the pre-application stage. Transport assessments and statements will be required to 16.20 provide detailed information on the range of transport users and modes, including the movement of people and goods, both before and after a proposed development has been constructed. A transport assessment or statement should identify and address transport impacts on all modes of transport and set out the measures to avoid, remedy or mitigate identified impacts of the development. Applicants/developers should also submit a travel plan alongside 16.21 the planning application, where appropriate. The scale of development and the level of impact determined by the transport assessment or statement will dictate the type and scope of the travel plan. Transport for London provides guidance that sets out the requirements for each type of travel plan.

Travel plans must set targets, objectives and provide detail on implementation, funding and monitoring. Part 2 seeks to ensure that development does not exacerbate 16.22 or overload transport networks through trips associated with its uses. Where appropriate, conditions and/or planning contributions will be sought through Section 106 monies to secure mitigation measures required to make a development acceptable in transport terms. This is in addition to community infrastructure levy contributions which fund transport infrastructure improvements on a borough-wide scale. All contributions towards new transport infrastructure improvements must be in accordance with Policy D.SG5 and the Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document (SPD). Areas in the borough anticipated to accommodate higher levels 16.23 of the population and economic growth such as the Isle of Dogs and City Fringe are where existing highway and/or public transport demand is already close to or exceeding supply during peak travel times. Other areas of the borough also experience local highway or public transport stress during these times. Development that increases demand without appropriate mitigation (including infrastructure contributions to service improvements and/or delivering effective modal shift) will not be supported. 192 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES Explanation This policy seeks to ensure that parking is controlled and 16.24 managed both on-street and off-street to facilitate sustainable travel patterns and address congestion. Minimising car parking provision releases space to accommodate other more efficient uses, such as housing, employment, community facilities, play areas, amenity spaces and cycle parking. Demand for on-street parking exceeds capacity, creating a 16.25 significant amount of stress across the borough’s street network. This demand has also increased significantly in recent years as a result of population growth. In addition, the issue of on-street parking outside of controlled hours (usually overnight and at weekends) often overcrowds streets; results in unacceptable safety and accessibility issues for vulnerable road users; and, in some cases, restricts traffic flows and increases journey times. 16.26 Due to excessive on-street parking and land use intensification, the borough does not have the capacity for development to come forward that does not manage its own parking within the curtilage of the site. However, we recognise that some people, businesses and 16.27 organisations rely on private vehicle use as their only transport option. If car parking is essential, it must be fully justified in the transport assessment (in line with the parking standards in Appendix 3) and provided entirely on-site. Any development seeking to make alterations to on-street 16.28 parking and/or loading must be fully justified and will only be permitted where there is proven on-street capacity. Any permitted changes must be fully funded by the developer. Part 1 directs applicants and developers to the detailed parking 16.29 standards for vehicles and bicycles in Appendix 3. A sufficient amount of cycle parking should be provided to accommodate current demand", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**16.

Design of cycle parking has been extensively covered in the Transport for London’s Cycle Design Standards and developers are required to take account of this when designing cycle facilities. Parking may be required for those with accessibility or wheelchair 16.30 needs; and accessible parking bay provision should form a proportion of the overall parking provision (as calculated using the Mayor of London’s Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance). In applying the residential parking standards (see Appendix 3), applicants/developers should consider any future changes to public transport accessibility levels (PTAL) as a result of new infrastructure provision, particularly in areas of low public transport accessibility (PTAL 1 and 2). Furthermore, where development exceeds the PTAL density range set out in the London Plan, we will apply the parking standards in Appendix 3 based on the proposed density rather than the PTAL rating. Part 2 ensures that all residential development will be permit-free 16.31 and any parking required must be provided off-street. Part 3 requires sustainable approaches to parking within new 16.32 developments such as car clubs and pool car schemes; this space must be accommodated and designed before any other parking is considered. This will enable exemplary design and ensure the cycle parking provided is fit for purpose. Car clubs are cheaper alternatives to car ownership and will allow for occasional car use but discourage unnecessary car journeys. Development should also provide parking bays and charging 16.33 points for electric vehicles, based on the standards and design principles set out in the London Plan. However, we recognise that residents, particularly those in 16.34 affordable housing, do not always have the choice over where they live. As such, where development provides car parking, first priority should be given to families (units of three or more bedrooms) and the disabled across all tenures in the development. A parking management plan that directs the occupiers as to 16.35 how the parking will be managed, allocated and enforced may be a requirement where development includes vehicle parking. 16.36 Around 80% of our residents live in flats, and much of this accommodation has extremely limited cycle parking, cycle storage or docking space. To increase access to cycling in the borough, we are working closely with the Mayor of London and Transport for London to extend the existing cycle hire scheme with new docking stations in appropriate locations. Where appropriate, development will be expected to safeguard land within the site where Transport for London has identified a need to accommodate publicly-accessible shared cycle-hire station(s). This policy must be read in conjunction with Policy D.TR4 16.37 and Appendix 3 to ensure that along with on-site parking provision, development provides adequate delivery and servicing facilities within the site as well as encouraging shared servicing arrangements and timing of deliveries. 194 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 3: POLICIES Explanation Deliveries and servicing are essential to the economic growth of 16.38 the borough. By 2025, the continued growth of London is expected to result in a 15% increase in demand for freight and servicing [79] . These trips will add to traffic congestion and, if they are not managed and contained off the highway, will lead to blocking of both local and strategic roads whilst loading/unloading of goods takes place. This will significantly increase journey times, particularly for buses. Freight vehicles are typically some of the most polluting vehicles 16.39 on our roads. Furthermore, the projected growth in the borough will lead to increased construction traffic and associated vehicles which tend to bring more pollution, noise and dust. This policy seeks to address the challenges the borough faces in 16.40 ensuring the efficient, safe, timely and sustainable movement of goods and materials across the borough, whilst seeking to improve air quality and reduce impacts arising from the freight network such as accidents, spillages or wastes. As the proportion of cyclists and pedestrians has increased, 16.41 pedestrian and cycle safety has become an area of increasing concern in Tower Hamlets, particularly given the rise in fatalities on busy arterial roads. Across London, nearly two-thirds of cyclist deaths and around a quarter of pedestrian deaths involve a heavy goods vehicle [80] . This policy seeks to reduce the impact of delivery, servicing and construction traffic on the environment and the health and well-being of residents in terms of noise disturbance and its contribution to road congestion and air pollution. 16.42 Part 1 ensures that development generating a significant number of vehicle trips for goods or materials will be assessed in relation to its likely impact on the transport network and with reference to the most up 79 Transport 2025: Transport vision for a growing world city (Transport for London, 2013) 80 New measures to rid London of dangerous lorries (Transport for London, September 2016)", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**16.

An assessment may also be required where a development has the potential to have a significant impact on the transport network. The level of assessment required will be decided through the development management process. Development will need to plan and manage its freight movements through the construction and operational phases of the development. Construction management plans and/or delivery and servicing plans are required to show how the Construction Logistics and Community Safety (CLOCS) standard has been incorporated and that fleets serving the site have Fleet Operator Recognition Scheme (FORS) silver accreditation. 16.43 In addition, development will need to provide sufficient space for deliveries and servicing within the site curtilage and off the public highway (including refuse collection). If this is not practical then on-street provision may be considered so long as it: a. can be clearly demonstrated and adequately justified b. does not restrict traffic flows, or c. does not compromise the safety of other roads users. Development must seek to prioritise sustainable methods in the 16.44 movement of goods and services, particularly sites with significantly greater delivery and servicing frequencies and sizes. Construction can make significant environmental and cost savings through more sustainable methods of recycling existing materials; this can significantly reduce freight movements by vehicles such as tipper trucks which tend to be more polluting and more hazardous to cyclists compared to other vehicles. Part 1(d) requires development to minimise the amount of 16.45 deliveries it receives; this may be achieved through a number of measures in the Mayor of London’s Transport Strategy and Transport for London’s supporting documents. Residential development will require bespoke management and delivery accommodation when compared to commercial development. The rapid acceleration of internet shopping has resulted in a significant growth of smaller light goods vehicles, which increase congestion and pollution at peak times as well as traditionally quieter times. Delivery vehicles to residential addresses often park on the highway causing traffic flow and safety concerns. This disruption increases with missed deliveries whereby the same address receives a second or third delivery attempt. Development should provide space for these deliveries and help ensure all such deliveries are completed on the first attempt. The borough’s river and rail network represents an underused 16.46 resource and priority should be given to utilising the railways, rivers and canals to facilitate the movement of waste and goods, particularly the safeguarded wharves such as Northumberland Wharf and Orchard Wharf (see Parts 2 and 3). The policy also requires adjacent development to recognise the role of wharves and depots and must not negatively impact their functions. 196 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**16.

Successful place-making is critical to creating cohesive, well-connected and more vibrant communities and ensuring that development responds positively to the distinct and unique characteristics which make Tower Hamlets a great place to live, work and visit. Policy S.SG1 (Areas of growth and opportunity within Tower 17.2 Hamlets) sets out the overall strategy of how and where growth will be distributed across the borough. This section provides more detail on how different areas of the borough will accommodate this growth in line with the principles of sustainable development. In order to realise the vision and objectives of the Local Plan, 17.3 the following sub-areas have been identified to positively manage development opportunities and change in the borough at the strategic level: z City Fringe z Central z Lower Lea Valley z Isle of Dogs and South Poplar. This section sets out how each sub-area will grow and change 17.4 over the period to 2031. In particular, it sets out the vision, objectives and overarching principles which will inform and guide development proposals within each sub-area, taking account of the character and identity of the borough’s 24 places (see Figure 4). Within each sub-area, a number of sites (known as allocations) 17.5 have been identified to accommodate new homes and jobs alongside necessary infrastructure, such as open space, health and education facilities. All of the sub-areas and site allocations are shown in Figure 18. 17.6 This section also contains figures illustrating each sub-area and the site allocations within them. These figures are illustrative and show how the principles and requirements set out in this section could be implemented. Development within these sub-areas will also need to take 17.7 account of other relevant guidance and supporting information such as supplementary planning guidance/supplementary planning documents, masterplans and opportunity area planning frameworks. 17.8 When determining a planning application, flexibility may be applied to the policies relating to the site allocation requirements based on an up-to-date assessment of need and the agreed viability position of the scheme to ensure the site allocation is deliverable in the context of the principles of sustainable development. Neighbourhood plans may also shape the future planning of these 17.9 areas at a neighbourhood level and developers and other relevant parties will need to consult with neighbourhood forums to inform development proposals in the neighbourhood planning areas. Some of the site allocations are under multiple ownership and 17.10 comprise a number of development plots. In such cases, effective engagement between landowners, developers and leaseholders needs to take place in order to facilitate potential land assembly and comprehensive redevelopment. 198 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits SECTION 4: DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE PLACES Figure 18: Sub-areas and site allocations SECTION 4: DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE PLACES", "level": 2, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**17.

Managing development**", "content": "In order to ensure the Local Plan policies are put into action and 22.1 sites in the borough are delivered in line with the vision and objectives set out in Section 2, we will continue to undertake regular monitoring and adopt the following implementation approaches. The Local Plan will be the main mechanism through which 22.2 planning applications are determined. The broader process of determining planning applications 22.3 encompasses pre-application discussions, planning performance agreements and the use of tools such as design reviews and sustainability checklists. We will also use special legislative tools (such as article 4 directions) where there is a particular need. In particular, we consider that inclusive and responsive pre22.4 application engagement is crucial to achieving speedier decisions and better quality developments, and is strongly encouraged. While the outcome of an application cannot be guaranteed, a planning application is more likely to succeed if it is well prepared, accords with the Local Plan and properly addresses/responds to relevant challenges raised at the pre-application stage. When preparing planning applications, applicants and developers 22.5 should have regard to the requirements set out in the latest validation checklist, which can be downloaded from our website. As a priority, we aim to promote a coordinated approach to 22.6 development through the development management process and negotiations with landowners, developers and other interested parties. Where considered necessary, we have legal powers to compulsorily purchase land to enable development in line with the regeneration aspirations set out in the plan, but this will always be a last resort. Alongside the policies set out in the Local Plan, we will also take 22.7 account of supplementary planning documents and other relevant guidance when determining planning applications. These include: z Tall Buildings Study z Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document z Development Viability Supplementary Planning Document. 22.8 Area-specific plans and masterplans are key to realising the vision of the Local Plan and informing the redevelopment of key sites and areas of change. We will continue to develop and use masterplans to influence the design and layout of new development in collaboration with infrastructure providers and other relevant organisations. Other relevant guidance is prepared at the regional and sub22.9 regional level, including the Mayor of London’s supplementary planning guidance which provides further detail to the policies set out in the development plan. In order to achieve the vision and objectives set out in the Local 22.10 Plan, there may be a requirement to impose conditions to mitigate any negative impacts arising from development proposals to make them acceptable. Any conditions that we impose on development proposals will be 22.11 consistent with relevant guidance, including the National Planning Policy Framework.

We have prepared a statement of how we intend to involve local 23.2 community groups, residents, businesses and other stakeholders in the preparation and implementation of our planning policy documents and in the consideration of planning applications [85] . With the highest target for new homes in London, housing 23.3 delivery is one of the most important challenges facing the borough. Along with the Tower Hamlets Housing Strategy (2016) and Housing Delivery Strategy (2017), we have established several key delivery mechanisms to ensure successful housing delivery across the borough. These include the following: SECTION 5: MONITORING AND DELIVERING z The Tower Hamlets Housing Forum – a partnership between ourselves (the council) and housing associations (registered providers). Its purpose is to help deliver the adopted strategy (including the delivery of new affordable homes to meet a range of needs); collaborate on developing good practice; and improve housing, maintenance and development standards. z Greater London Authority grant funding – along with registered providers, we can apply for grant funding and support to help facilitate affordable housing delivery z Housing delivery vehicles – we have established two bespoke housing delivery vehicles (Seahorse Homes Limited and Mulberry Housing Society) to expand the range of interventions in the housing market and provide a range of new homes (both market and affordable) that meet the needs of the rapidly growing local population z Poplar Riverside Housing Zone – the Mayor of London proposed ‘housing zones’ as a means of accelerating the delivery of housing within areas of potential. The Poplar Riverside Housing Zone will be the key mechanism to delivering new homes in this part of the borough. Opportunities will be sought to improve the management and 23.4 performance of our town centres, with a focus on the evening and night time economy, facilitated through various initiatives, such as working with town centre partnerships and forums. 85 Tower Hamlets Statement of Community Involvement Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits 283 SECTION 5: MONITORING AND DELIVERING", "level": 2, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**23.

Neighbourhood planning takes place within designated 24.2 neighbourhood areas. These are defined by the community and have to be agreed with us before they can be designated. The neighbourhood areas must meet legislative requirements, including that they form a coherent spatial area. Neighbourhood planning is led by designated neighbourhood 24.3 forums. These are groups made up of local residents, workers, business owners and elected members. There are a number of designated neighbourhood areas in 24.4 Tower Hamlets with active neighbourhood forums. In some parts of the borough, neighbourhood forums are preparing neighbourhood plans which will provide additional area-specific policies alongside the Local Plan [86] . Neighbourhood plans must be in general conformity with the 24.5 strategic policies of the development plan, and can allocate sites to deliver housing and other uses and provide additional guidance to address specific neighbourhood issues or identify opportunities for regeneration and priority projects within the neighbourhood area.

Infrastructure delivery**", "content": "We have been working closely with infrastructure providers, 25.1 delivery partners and other relevant organisations to ensure that the necessary infrastructure to support planned growth is delivered. The Tower Hamlets Infrastructure Delivery Plan identifies the infrastructure and services that will be required to meet the anticipated growth targets and objectives set out in the Local Plan. It is not an exhaustive list and other items will be required, as appropriate, in response to new development in the borough. The Infrastructure Delivery Plan will therefore be updated on an annual basis. 25.2 The majority of future infrastructure projects will be financed from monies secured through Section 106 agreements and the community infrastructure levy (see below) or equivalent. However, the exploration, identification and use of other funding sources (e.g. grants, subsidies and crowd-funding) will also require us to work with partner organisations and other stakeholders (including Transport for London, Greater London Authority and other government departments) to maximise the monies available to deliver infrastructure projects. Further information about the infrastructure requirements of specific sites and areas where significant development is planned is outlined in Section 4. The community infrastructure levy applies a standard charge to 25.3 developments, as specified in the charging schedule, and will be used to fund infrastructure needed to support the development of an area: this includes transport, parks, schools, health facilities and leisure centres. The Mayor of London’s community infrastructure levy will be 25.4 used to raise funds towards major infrastructure projects of strategic importance such as Crossrail 2 [87] . 86 Further information on the areas in the borough where neighbourhood planning is taking place can be found from our website at www.towerhamlets.co.uk. 87 For further details about the Mayor of London’s community infrastructure levy and the Crossrail Funding Supplementary Planning Guidance, please visit the Greater London.

Appendix 4: Waste collection ** **standards**", "content": "Residential refuse and recycling provision Under the Environmental Protection Act (1990), we have a 31.1 legal duty to collect waste from households. We currently provide a weekly collection of refuse, recyclables from all properties and a weekly collection of organics from street level properties. All dwellings, individual and multi-occupancy must have sufficient storage capacity to store all materials for a minimum of eight days-worth of waste as detailed in the table below. Waste capacity guidelines SECTION 6: APPENDICES Internal storage requirements Residents will be responsible for providing their own internal 31.2 containers. Developers are encouraged to install internal containers within individual units for future occupants. All new properties should have sufficient space (preferably in the kitchen area of each property) for residents to be able to separate out waste into three different containers (recyclable, non-recyclable and food waste). Waste collection systems for residential properties In exceptional circumstances where we consider that traditional 31.3 wheeled and Euro bins are appropriate, the developer should contact the council’s team that manages waste to obtain the latest bin specifications. We have no statutory duty to supply containers for the storage of waste. It is the responsibility of the managing agent/landlord to provide collection containers for all waste streams and ensure waste is stored in a suitable container away from the highway as it is not permitted for bins to be placed on the highway. All waste containers should conform to the most up to date British Standards. Applicants should note that part H6 of the building regulations 31.4 makes it a requirement for a resident not to carry waste for more than 30 metres from the front door of the development. It is recommended that residents have access to the waste collection area from within the block or development and not have to access the area via the public highway or any type of road even if the distance is less than 30 metres. All waste collection systems and bin stores should have 31.5 construction security, ventilation and cleansing provisions designed in accordance with the most up-to-date British Standard or equivalent replacement document. Similarly, suitable precautions should be provided to mitigate the fire risk (e.g. sprinklers, fire extinguishers and smoke detection equipment). |Number of bedrooms|Suggested capacity per week (litres)|Col3|Col4|Col5| |||||| ||Refuse|Dry recyclables|Without garden waste|With garden waste| |1|70|60|23|100| |2|120|90|23|100| |3|165|120|23|200| |4|215|150|23|200|", "level": 2, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**31.

All proposals must be discussed on an individual basis and will be subject to agreement with our team that manages waste. Where a bin storage area is considered appropriate it must be 31.7 within 10 metres wheeling distance of the collection point. The paths between the storage facility and the collection point must be a minimum width of 1.5 metres, be free from obstructions and steps, have a solid foundation and be suitably paved with a smooth continuous finish. The ground should be level and not have a gradient more than 1:12, towards the vehicle. A dropped kerb is also required to wheel the bins. The bin stores must be designed so that the waste collection operatives are able to access the waste storage area without entering the building and there should only be one entry/exit to the bin store area. Enclosed bin stores must have internal lighting and there must be enough space and a wide enough doorway for an operative to easily manoeuvre the containers in and out. The dimensions (in metres and cubic metres) of the bins must be included with the application. It is the responsibility of the managing agent/landlord to ensure 31.8 that all bins are correctly presented and easily accessible for collection. 31.9 Bin stores must be fitted with standard FB1 or FB2 fire brigade locks or incorporate door codes, and the developer should liaise with our team that manage the collection of waste about the key or code arrangements. Once operational, the managing agent/landlord will be required to provide access for collection crews as required. Where access is required across a public highway, suitable 31.10 drop kerb crossovers should be provided. Where parking spaces are in existence, arrangements should be made with us to enable a bin with dimensions of 1700 x 1200mm to be wheeled between the parked vehicles. 31.11 Doors to bin stores where collections are directly off the highway should either have sliding doors or doors opening inwards. This is to ensure that the highway is not obstructed. All doors should have stays or catches to avoid collection crews having to open the doors on multiple occasions. 31.12 We prefer collection of waste from ground floor level and any property that proposes storage elsewhere should make arrangements to present waste at ground floor level. Where this is not achievable, our team that manages waste should be consulted prior to submission of a full planning application. Where compactors are planned at basement or ground level, it 31.13 is preferred that provision for storage of organic waste/compostable materials is also made at the same level. If waste storage is at basement level, vehicle access should be provided at this level, or there should be adequate provision to move waste to the ground floor for collection. Where chute systems are proposed, they must be designed 31.14 in accordance with the most up to date British Standard or equivalent replacement document; also there must be provision for the collection of refuse, recyclable and compostable materials via this method. If used, chutes should not be spaced at more than 60 metres intervals, on the assumption that an occupier should not be required to carry waste a distance of more than 30 metres. The chute termination should be by a bifurcated baffle plate or by a swivel chute end. Where underground systems are proposed, there must be 31.15 provision for collecting refuse and recycling via this method. Provision for the storage and collection of compostable materials must be made at the same level and in the same area. Please refer to the supplementary guidance for more information on underground collection systems. 320 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits For mixed-use developments there must be segregation between 31.16 residential and commercial waste storage areas. The locations of the waste containers should be clearly shown on the plans, including the dimensions and capacities proposed. Individual properties Proposals involving detached, semi-detached and mid-terrace 31.17 houses and other property without side or rear access must include unobtrusive areas suitable for housing two wheelie bins (no more than 240 litres), a food waste caddy and a garden waste container. The container must not intrude on the street scene, and therefore must be contained within an appropriate front wall, fence or hedge for the garden, or alternatively within a dedicated and suitably designed structure within the boundary of the premises. Such areas must be convenient for use by residents with easy 31.18 access to the curtilage by the waste collection crews and steps should be avoided. If the area has a gradient, it should not exceed 1:12 towards the vehicle. If the storage area is within prominent view of the highway, a footpath or other public vantage point, then the bin area should be screened to avoid public usage. All waste containers should be stored not more than 10 metres from the collection point and should be unobstructed. If the collection point is in front of parking spaces, there should be adequate room for them to be wheeled to the collection vehicle. There must be at least 150mm clearance between each bin and the enclosure must have a minimum height of 1200mm. All containers for individual properties should conform to British 31.19 Standard BS EN 840 or the equivalent replacement document. Developers are encouraged to install compost bins in all private 31.20 gardens to encourage their use by residents. SECTION 6: APPENDICES Bulky waste collection 31.21 All multi-storey residential developments must have a separate space for the short-term storage of bulky items of furniture or electrical items, at ground level. It may be appropriate to provide covered accommodation for the storage of these items, as some may be reusable. The number of stores depends on the number of blocks, size of homes and number of units. Where necessary, our team that manages waste and the fire brigade should be consulted to help with advice regarding size of bulky waste store and minimisation of arson risk. Commercial waste provision In mixed developments segregation of residential and commercial 31.22 waste is required. Every commercial unit should have their own independent bin store areas. The residential development should follow guidance as detailed in the section on ‘waste collection systems for residential properties – multi occupancy properties’. 31.23 It is difficult to anticipate the volume of refuse and recycling produced at commercial premises. Further guidance and recommendations can be found in BS5906:2005 Code of Practice or the equivalent replacement document for waste management in buildings. Developers can also contact our team that manages waste to discuss their requirements. It should also be noted that the waste regulations require the 31.24 separate collections of paper, metal, plastic and glass where technically, economically, and environmentally practicable. Developers should ensure that this requirement can be met, where necessary.", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**31.

{"id": "6d43131e-bed7-45a5-9256-ec0ffccd0545", "title": "Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits 321", "content": "SECTION 6: APPENDICES Waste collection vehicles – specifications and guidance Developers should ensure that roads have suitable foundations 31.25 and surfaces to withstand the maximum payload of vehicles. Manhole covers and gratings etc located on the highway must also be strong enough to withstand this weight. Vehicles should not be expected to reverse. If this is unavoidable, 31.26 then the maximum reversing distance should be 20 metres. A safe stopping bay or equivalent should be provided with a sufficient turning area and manoeuvring space for the collection vehicle (which may be a six-wheeled HGV) as specified within the Freight Transport Association’s publication ‘Designing for Deliveries’ or the equivalent replacement document. Developers should demonstrate with auto tracks that the 31.27 collection vehicles (using our waste collection vehicle measurements) can manoeuvre around and within the site (where applicable) without undue impact on pedestrian safety or traffic flow. Developers should contact our team that manages waste for information on the vehicles currently in operation. Maintenance of waste containers and related facilities The maintenance of bin stores, chute systems, containers, 31.28 underground systems, paths and roadways is the responsibility of the managing agent, landlord, residents’ board or equivalent, with the exception of council-owned containers. Managing organisations are responsible for the management 31.29 and maintenance of bin stores, waste containers including underground systems, compactors and automated waste collection systems. We are not responsible for container maintenance or 31.30 replacement. Managing organisations must ensure that the containers are cleaned regularly and properly maintained. Non-traditional mass waste collection and storage systems There are a number of non-traditional waste collection systems 31.31 that can be incorporated into developments. All of the systems require land to be set aside to store collected waste materials. While it is not our responsibility to prescribe the type of waste 31.32 collection and storage facility developers should incorporate into a development, the facility must be compatible with our waste collection vehicles. It is therefore advised that applicants/developers contact the team that manages waste collection prior to the submission of a planning application to ascertain whether the system is compatible with our collection service. There are three main groups of waste collection systems and 31.33 some are on-site waste processing systems, which could be considered to help us reduce the burden on waste collection services. These are as follows: z Underground container systems z Vacuum collection systems z On-site compaction and container collection systems. It should be noted that the above is not an exhaustive list of 31.34 alternative waste collection and storage systems and developers/ applicants can present other methods that are compatible with our waste collection service. 322 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits Underground container collection systems Underground container collection systems are already in use 31.35 within the borough and have proven to be a good solution to high-density developments and they can also be incorporated into developments of much lower densities. This system involves a large steel container set into a concrete hole underground, above which is a set of inlet containers to allow residents to deposit bagged waste materials. The design of the inlet containers can vary greatly and can be adjusted to suit the specific design requirements of the development or streetscape. These systems are suitable for dry mixed recycling and residual 31.36 waste. The container systems allow more waste to be stored in the centralised underground containers than traditional bins/bags, and therefore reduces vehicle movements. In instances where there is more than one building proposed as part of the development, the underground container system eliminates the need for a refuse collection from each building. 31.37 The flexibility of these systems is such that the inlet containers can be located outside of the building, in front courtyards allowing residents to deposit waste when they are leaving the building. Access to the containers can be restricted for residents only through the use of fobs that are operated by a sensor. Containers can also be fitted with sensors to measure their fill level. It should be noted that these systems are not generally suitable 31.38 for food waste and therefore additional space within the development is required to accommodate this fraction of waste. SECTION 6: APPENDICES Vacuum collection systems Vacuum systems involve waste being conveyed through a 31.39 network of underground pipes from residential blocks to a central bulking point or ‘terminal building’ where the materials are bulked up into containers. The system is capable of dealing with all three fractions of waste, residual, dry mixed recycling and food waste. Like the underground container system this one also allows more waste to be stored and therefore reduces vehicle movements. Residents ‘post’ waste materials into the inlet containers, 31.40 similar to the underground container systems. The system is operated automatically through a system of sensors and valves that are linked to a computer system located in the terminal building. It is possible to integrate the vacuum system within buildings, so that residents can place waste materials into chutes on each floor of their block for ease of use/ access. 31.41 The flexibility of these systems is such that the inlet container can be located inside or outside of the building to suit budget and design. On-site compaction and container collection systems On-site compaction and collection systems principally involve 31.42 large roll on roll off containers for storing waste materials combined with an electrically powered hydraulic ram to reduce the volume of waste inside the containers and a hopper for depositing waste materials safely into the container. Containers will be required to collect segregated fractions of 31.43 waste.", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**31.

Residents would control the system through selecting the correct button on a panel located at the chute door. 31.45 The flexibility of these systems is such that access can be restricted to residents through sensors. Food waste macerators Food waste disposal units within developments are also an 31.46 option, subject to approval from Thames Water. They involve small macerators installed under domestic kitchen sinks used to grind food waste into slurry to allow for it to be disposed of through the normal wastewater system. The macerator is fitted just underneath the kitchen sink and once installed it mechanically chops and grinds food waste using blades. These systems can also reduce the need for traditional bin collection, as the materials are treated by water treatment companies and the sewerage system.", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**31.

Good design – Ensuring developments incorporate the concept of “good acoustic design” [91], including through minimising the number of sensitive receptors exposed to noise; ensuring adequate distances between the noise source and sensitive receptors or areas, limiting conflict of use in the development both internally and externally; utilising where possible barriers, natural or otherwise, other buildings, or non-critical rooms in a building. 2. Engineering – reducing noise at source; improving the sound insulation internally and externally of exposed receptors; screening by purpose-built barriers. 3. Administrative – limiting operation time of source, restricting activities allowed on the site, specifying an acceptable noise limit. Several of these measures may be incorporated into the design of a development proposal. Where development is likely to be affected by, or give rise to, high noise levels, applicants are advised to seek the advice of environmental health officers or those with similar expertise. General principles When considering applications for development that will be 33.4 exposed to an existing noise source, we will take into account the ambient noise level existing at the proposed location at the time of the application and any future likely increase in noise impact that may reasonably be anticipated to occur due to development in the foreseeable future. Much 91 For more detail see ProPG: Planning and Noise – New Residential Development (Institute of Acoustics and Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and the Association of Noise Consultants, 2017). 326 Tower Hamlets Plan 2031 Managing Growth and Sharing Benefits of the borough is subject to ambient noise levels during the day and at night from transportation, commercial, industrial and leisure sources that are higher than those at which the lowest adverse effects, as defined in policy and guidance, can occur. Development therefore should not make the noise circumstances worse and where possible should improve the situation by lowering noise levels and/or modifying the soundscape in a positive fashion. In the case of applications involving noise sensitive 33.5 developments, we will require an applicant to include information about the noise impact of development, or the assessed effect of an existing noise source and transport, industrial or commercial operation upon the development proposed. A noise impact assessment will be required to support 33.6 applications where noise sensitive uses are likely to be exposed to significant or unacceptable noise exposure as set out in policy D.ES9. Developers will be required to assess the impact of the proposal as a noise generator or receptor, as appropriate. It will also be required to demonstrate in full how the development will be designed, located and controlled to mitigate (as appropriate) the impact of noise on health and quality of life, neighbouring properties, and the surrounding area. We recommend that you seek advice from our environmental 33.7 health department in advance of any noise surveys on the methodology, duration and timing etc. of any surveys and advice regarding the nearest noise sensitive receptor. In all cases, the best practical means of mitigation will be required 33.8 to mitigate noise impact to an appropriate level, and in liaison with our environmental health service. Where necessary, we will use planning conditions and enter into 33.9 planning obligations under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as modified by Section 12 of the Planning and Compensation Act 1991) to control noise levels.

The design criteria outlined below are defined in the corresponding noise tables. z NOEL – No observed effect level z LOAEL – Lowest observed adverse effect level z SOAEL – Significant observed adverse effect level. 33.12 The values will vary depending on the context, type of noise and sensitivity of the receptor. z Green – where noise is considered to be at an acceptable level. In this category development is likely to be granted. z Amber – where noise is observed to have an adverse effect level, but which may be considered acceptable when assessed in the context of other merits of the development. In this category permission is likely to be refused unless a good acoustic design process is followed. z Red – where noise is observed to have a significant adverse effect. In this category development is likely to be refused. Applicants should seek expert advice on possible noise mitigation measures. Proposed developments - sensitive to noise Special consideration will need to be given to noise-sensitive 33.13 developments that are proposed in areas which are, or expected to become, subject to levels of noise which are likely to have an adverse effect. The threshold of acceptability of the noise will primarily depend on two factors: the intended use of the noise sensitive development and the source of the noise experienced, or likely to be experienced. Applications for residential development should demonstrate a 33.14 consideration of ‘good acoustic design’ [92] . 92 For more detail see ProPG: Planning and Noise – New Residential Development (Institute of Acoustics and Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and the Association of Noise Consultants, 2017).", "level": 3, "path": ["**sharing the benefits**", "**33.

For premises where entertainment takes place less frequently 33.21 than once per week, music and associated sources should not be audible inside noise-sensitive property between 23:00 and 07:00 hours. For the purposes of this document, airborne noise may be 33.22 considered not audible when it is at a low enough level such that it is not recognisable as emanating from the source in question and it does not alter the perception of the ambient noise environment that would prevail in the absence of the source in question Design criteria For the airborne transmission of entertainment noise the 33.23 following noise rating curves (NR) measured as a 5 minute linear Leq are regarded as meeting the above objectives: The above design criteria apply to the airborne transmission 33.24 of entertainment noise. The structure borne transmission of noise is regarded as more problematic as the noise tends to take on much more low frequency bias as it propagates through the structure and the noise is often radiated simultaneously from multiple elements of the structure e.g. floors, walls and ceilings, leading to an all-encompassing surrounding sense of perception; in addition structure borne noise can often be perceived as vibration as well as sound, adding to the adverse effect. Consequently, where there is a risk of structure borne transmission of entertainment noise to sensitive premises we may seek more stringent criteria than for airborne entertainment noise. Developers are therefore encouraged to consult with our environmental health department at an early stage in the consideration of the scheme to address this issue and to submit proposals to mitigate the risk for review.

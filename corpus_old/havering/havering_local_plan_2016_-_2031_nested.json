There is a need for new infrastructure, homes and jobs and Havering needs a spatial plan that will enable the borough to rise to these challenges and address each of these needs. 1.1.2 The Local Plan indicates the broad locations in Havering for future housing, employment, retail, leisure, transport, community services and other types of development. The policies in this Local Plan will help ensure that the needs of the borough over the next 15 years are sustainably met. 1.1.3 The Local Plan and Policies Map together with the London Plan, the Joint Waste Development Plan Document (DPD) for the East London Waste Authority Boroughs and Havering's forthcoming Site Specific Allocations Local Plan will comprise the Development Plan for the borough and will be the primary basis against which planning applications are assessed. 1.1.4 In due course the Site Specific Allocations Local Plan will identify individual sites for specific uses that are intended to assist in delivering the priorities, objectives and strategy set out in this Local Plan. 1.1.5 The Local Plan has been prepared to be purposely focused and concise and to have a user friendly, accessible format. It is essential that the Plan is considered alongside the National Planning Policy Framework and the London Plan as it does not repeat policies that are already set out within these documents. 1.1.6 The Havering Local Plan was prepared in the context of the London Plan 2016. At a late stage in the Examination process the London Plan 2021 was published. The Local Plan was found to be in general conformity with the new London Plan. All references to the London Plan in this document refer to the London Plan 2021 unless otherwise stated. 1.1.7 The Council recognise the importance of an immediate update of the Local Plan in the context of the new London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 which have both been published since the Local Plan was submitted for Examination. The immediate update of the Local Plan will also take account of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020 that came into force on 1 September 2020. The timetable for the update of the Local Plan is set out below and will be reflected in the Council's Local Development Scheme. Preparation of evidence base - throughout 2021 and 2022 Regulation 18 consultation - summer 2022 Regulation 19 consultation - spring 2023 Submission to the Secretary of State - late summer 2023 1.1.8 On adoption of this Local Plan the following documents that form part of the current Local Development Framework (2008) will be superseded: Core Strategy (2008) Development Control Policies (2008) Proposals Map (2008) - will be superseded by a new Policies Map for the Local Plan and this will include the changes identified in the Proposals Map Changes booklet(s) and those elements of the existing Proposals Map which will be unchanged. Sustainable Design and Construction Supplementary Planning Document (2009) Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document (2013) which was superseded by the introduction of Havering CIL (2019) 1.1.9 The Council will retain the remaining existing allocations in the Romford Area Action Plan (2008) and the Site Specific Allocations (2008) until masterplans are adopted for the Romford and Rainham and Beam Park areas, respectively. 1.1.10 The policies within this Local Plan should be considered as a whole. Developments will be assessed against all applicable policies. Some policies apply only to specific geographical areas or particular types of development and this is set out clearly in the relevant policy and supporting text. 4 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

Since February 2015, our vision has been to create a clean, safe and proud borough. Whilst these are key values to the people of Havering, our borough has so much more to offer, not just to our own residents but also to the whole of London. 2.1.2 The Council's new vision is about embracing the best of what Havering has to offer. The new vision is focused around four cross-cutting priorities: Communities, Places, Opportunities and Connections : Communities - We want to help our residents to make positive lifestyle choices and ensure a good start for every child to reach their full potential. We will support families and communities to look after themselves and each other, with a particular emphasis on our most vulnerable residents. Places - We will work to achieve a clean, safe environment for all. This will be secured through working with residents to improve our award-winning parks and continuing to invest in our housing stock, ensuring decent, safe and high standard properties. Our residents will have access to vibrant culture and leisure facilities, as well as thriving town centres. Opportunities - We will provide first-class business opportunities by supporting the commercial development of companies within the borough, as well as being a hub for start-ups and expanding businesses. We will ensure sustainable economic growth that generates local wealth and opportunities, as well as securing investment in high-quality skills and careers. Connections - We want to capitalise on our location with fast and accessible transport links both within the borough and to central London, as well as making the most of national and international connections. Likewise, we will continue to make Havering a digitally-enabled borough that is connected to residents and businesses. Enhancing our connections will strengthen the borough’s offer as a Greater London hub for business. 2.2 Havering in 15 years from now 2.2.1 It is an exciting time for Havering; the population is growing and becoming more diverse and the borough is an increasingly attractive part of London in which to live, develop and invest. We want to position Havering as one of London's most successful and attractive outer London boroughs. The vision for the Local Plan builds on the Council's overarching vision and provides a snapshot of what Havering will aspire to be like in 15 years from now. 2.2.2 By 2031, Havering will have seen significant levels of growth in the form of new infrastructure and high quality, well managed development. These developments will have further enhanced the borough as a highly desirable, attractive, safe and clean place to live and work, offering residents an excellent quality of life. Havering will be a place with integrated, sustainable communities in which residents are proud to live and where they have access to a range of high quality housing options, high standards of education, local and regional employment opportunities, community, leisure and cultural facilities, open space and a modern, reliable and effective transport system. 2.2.3 By 2031, significant progress will have been made, by working collaboratively with other stakeholders, towards the delivery of essential large scale infrastructure interventions. Gallows Corner roundabout will have been successfully remodelled providing further development opportunities, improved air quality, smoother traffic flows and enhanced road and pedestrian safety. Romford will have seen transformational changes to the road network, the western part of the ring road will have been tunnelled which will have enhanced the integration of surrounding residential communities with the town centre as well as improving traffic flow. A new, modern and efficient public transport connection between the North and South of the borough will be underway and will provide much needed connectivity. 6 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

      "content": "2.2.4 Romford will have benefited from Crossrail and improved accessibility into Central London and beyond. The town's extensive residential and commercial development opportunities will have been realised and it will be thriving as the largest and most successful town centre within the borough and wider sub-region competing successfully with Stratford to the west and Lakeside and Bluewater to the east. As a key residential growth area Romford will offer high quality integrated town centre living and will be viewed as a place with a mixed and balanced community in which residents will wish to live and stay. There will be additional school places and a new health hub to serve both existing and new residents. The residential population will be supporting exciting new businesses and employment and entrepreneurial opportunities and Romford will be seen as an excellent place in which to do business. It will have built upon its historic character as a market town, with a successfully remodelled Market Place and a wide range of contemporary retail, service and leisure opportunities including an enhanced, and higher quality, restaurant and cultural offer. 2.2.5 Rainham and Beam Park in the south of the borough will have been successfully transformed and a new high quality and healthy residential neighbourhood will have been delivered. The new development will have its own identity and sense of place and be structured around a new railway station and vibrant local centre at Beam Park. Contemporary new development will have been integrated effectively with the historic Rainham village and surrounding residential neighbourhoods. The character of New Road will have been transformed from a traffic dominated corridor into an attractive urban street with enhanced public realm and a linear parkway with safe and convenient cycle and pedestrian routes. New and existing residents will be making full use of essential community infrastructure including a new primary school at Beam Park and new health and community facilities. 2.2.6 By 2031, the Council will have successfully progressed its ambitious house building and estate regeneration programme, providing new, high quality, contemporary homes on existing council owned housing estates. Havering residents will be benefiting from a greatly improved housing stock and wider range of housing options in well managed, attractive and safe developments that are integrated with the surrounding area. 2.2.7 The employment area to the south of Rainham and Beam Park will have retained its role as a strategically important industrial area and will have benefited from transformational new developments and an intensification of employment uses in a safe and secure environment. The area will have an enhanced reputation as a destination for international and local businesses and for skills and employment opportunities. Businesses will have been attracted to locate their head office within the area. Poor quality buildings will have been replaced with modern premises of different sizes providing exciting opportunities for a range of businesses including small companies wishing to expand. 2.2.8 The borough's district centres at Hornchurch, Upminster, Rainham, Collier Row, Elm Park and Harold Hill will be thriving as the heart of their communities and will provide an enhanced mix of uses, a successful retail and leisure offer and convenient local services. Opportunities that arise for new high quality residential development within, and in close proximity, to the centres will have provided much needed new homes and the increased residential populations will have enhanced the vitality and economic viability of the centres.

      "content": "2.2.9 By 2031, the cultural and creative industries will have a more prominent role in the borough's town centres, contributing to their diversity and appeal. Hornchurch will continue to be a sub-regionally important cultural centre anchored by the Queen's Theatre and Fairkytes Arts Centre. Romford will have a significantly enhanced and high quality cultural offer to meet the needs of the growing residential population. 2.2.10 Smaller local centres throughout the borough will have been enhanced through improvements to the street scene and quality of the environment. They will continue to be of importance to local communities, providing essential services in convenient locations. 2.2.11 Havering will enjoy a modern, first class, integrated system for getting people and goods around the borough. The transport system will provide choice and options to reduce the need to travel, offer opportunities for healthier lifestyles and improve the quality of life for all sections of the community, including those who are less mobile. This will provide a competitive advantage for local businesses and will be a major attraction for people moving into the borough. New development will be focused on those parts of the borough most accessible to public transport. 2.2.12 By 2019, Havering will be benefiting from the completion of Crossrail and the enhanced connections and increased capacity that this will provide. A new rail station at Beam Park will serve new residents and businesses in London Riverside by 2020. The borough will also see improved bus services and more routes and services into areas which are currently poorly provided for. 2.2.13 The borough's road network will continue to be maintained and enhanced, reflecting Havering’s location as an outer London borough and the recognition that some residents will continue to use the private car for travel. Provision will also be made for walking and cycling, offering a choice of transport modes for residents and visitors. 2.2.14 Havering's residents and businesses will benefit from modern, high quality digital infrastructure enabling both economic and social connections to be made. 2.2.15 Havering schools and colleges will maintain and build upon their reputation for excellence. More Havering residents will have the opportunity to participate in further and higher education and lifelong learning, enabling them to improve their skills and qualifications, as well as extending their personal development at all stages of life. Additional early learning and school places on existing and new school sites will be available to meet the needs of the current and future population in Havering. 2.2.16 Health will continue to be a key focus for the borough building on the strengthened role and responsibility that the Council has for public health. The overall health of residents will have improved and new developments will have increased opportunities for people to pursue healthier and more active lifestyles. There will be an enhanced range of appropriate care provision for the borough’s growing elderly population including support for people to live healthily and safely at home whenever possible. 2.2.17 Havering’s Green Belt, green and open spaces, biodiversity and heritage assets will continue to be valued and enhanced, recognising their contribution to Havering’s character and future resilience, the appeal of the borough as a place to live, work and visit and the health and well-being and overall quality of life for residents. Havering’s existing green spaces will continue to offer an array of recreation and leisure opportunities and, by 2031, will be more attractive and usable, as well as more accessible to residents. 8 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

The Havering Local Plan is required to be in general conformity with this. 4.0.3 In preparing the Local Plan, the Council has worked with neighbouring authorities both in Essex and London to understand and address the cross boundary issues linked to the level of growth being planned for individually and as a wider sub-region. 4.0.4 The Council is committed to working with the Mayor of London, neighbouring London boroughs and authorities, Essex County Council and other partners on an ongoing basis to address development issues affecting London and the wider sub-region. 4.0.5 Further details on the context provided by the London Plan and the Duty to Co-operate are set out in Annexes 2 and 5.

      "content": "5.1 Spatial strategy 5.1.1 Havering's population is expected to grow to over 293,000 [(1)] over the next 15 years. The Strategy underpinning the Local Plan seeks to ensure that there is the necessary growth in homes, jobs and critical infrastructure to support and sustain new and existing communities whilst also conserving and enhancing the borough's most valuable assets and maintaining its long established and strongly supported character and appearance as an outer London sub-urban borough. 5.1.2 The spatial strategy has been carefully prepared to reflect several important topics. Firstly, it takes account of the strategic context provided by the National Planning Policy Framework and the London Plan. It aims to translate the policy approaches applicable to Havering into planning policies that are both relevant and necessary. Secondly, it is the land-use planning tool whereby the Council will seek to deliver places and communities that will endure well into the remainder of this century. Thirdly, at a time when the delivery of new homes is seen as critical to London’s well being, it acknowledges the opportunity resulting from Havering having two key growth areas with Housing Zone status. The strategy is informed by the spatial portrait and key issues as set out in Annex 4 and is intended to deliver the vision and objectives as set out in Chapters 2 and 3. The strategy also takes account of environmental constraints, the finite availability of land for development and the need for the Council to balance different competing land uses and priorities in determining the most appropriate uses of land and forms of development. 5.1.3 The Council has developed its strategy to deliver ‘good growth’ in the right locations across Havering having regard to the potential of the individual areas identified for that growth and the importance of making sure it has a good fit with and integrates well with its surroundings. This growth will be dependent upon and facilitated by significant public transport investment and improvements. In line with national and Mayoral planning policy, development is to be directed to the most accessible and well connected areas in the borough where there are existing concentrations of supporting social and community infrastructure or where this can be delivered alongside, and supported by, new developments. 5.1.4 It follows from this that the Local Plan identifies two parts of Havering as the main areas for accommodating Havering’s growth over the plan period. Consistent with national and Mayoral planning policy, these are focused in the borough’s main town centre at Romford and the Rainham and Beam Park area which has been identified for several years as one of London’s main brownfield development opportunities. 5.1.5 Romford is identified as a metropolitan centre in the London Plan and is the largest town centre in the borough. Romford has scope for development across a number of well located and well connected sites. The Local Plan recognises its potential for significant regeneration and intensification. Romford is already a key transport hub in Havering with more than 25 bus routes using the town centre. A minimum of 6,000 new homes will be delivered in the Romford Strategic Development Area. From 2019, it will benefit from improved rail services as a result of the arrival of Elizabeth line services through Crossrail. Its potential has been recognised by its designation as a Mayoral Housing Zone and the Local Plan will provide the means to assist in accelerating the delivery of new homes on a number of sites in and around the town centre. This plan also envisages business growth and an expanded leisure and cultural role for Romford. The next London Plan will re-affirm the role of Romford by designating it as an Opportunity Area in recognition of its potential to address an important part of Havering’s growth potential. 5.1.6 Rainham and Beam Park is already identified within the London Riverside Opportunity Area which includes extensive land in both Havering and adjoining Barking and Dagenham. The London Riverside Opportunity Area Planning Framework (2015) identifies that the wider area has the capacity to provide 26,500 new homes and 16,000 new jobs across the two boroughs. In Havering, the focus will be on the intensification of industrial land in the Rainham Employment Area and the creation of new residential communities at Rainham and Beam Park. The scope for this is as a result of the provision of a new station at Beam Park and the opportunity to provide space for essential local services. Rainham and Beam Park was granted Housing Zone status by the Mayor of London in 2015 which will help accelerate residential development in the area. 1 GLA 2015 Round Population Projections - Long term trend 12 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

      "content": "5.1.7 The strategy has taken account of the pressing need for new homes across London and in Havering. It aims to make a significant contribution towards this whilst reflecting the importance that the community in the borough places on Havering keeping and enhancing its well established character and supporting forms of development that are well suited to suburban outer London. 5.1.8 The strategy recognises that significant numbers of Havering residents travel out of the borough to work. Nevertheless, the Council places a very high priority on ensuring that Havering has a prosperous economy and the strategy is directed at protecting and enhancing employment across the borough. The scope for new jobs in the main growth areas is recognised and these will complement the new homes in these locations. At the same time, the strategy looks to protect existing industrial and employment land and to make sure that Havering provides a wide range of jobs in well connected locations. 5.1.9 Further growth will be accommodated from major regeneration of the Council’s own housing estates. The Council is planning to build a significant number of new homes in one of the most ambitious local authority home building programmes in the country. The initial programme focuses on 12 sites across the borough delivering over 2,000 additional homes. 5.1.10 The borough's district centres are important providers of retail, leisure and essential services which meet the needs of local residents. The strategy is to maintain and enhance these centres and support the intensification of uses including residential development and business growth. 5.1.11 Havering is one of London's greenest boroughs with extensive open spaces and more than half of the borough designated as Metropolitan Green Belt as identified on the Policies Map. The spatial strategy of the Local Plan is to optimise the use of brownfield land with suitable brownfield sites being developed first meeting the demand for new homes and business growth and to provide continued protection for Havering's Green Belt and its most valuable open spaces and its ecological assets. The Thames Chase Community Forest will be enhanced in line with the Thames Chase Plan. A Brownfield Land Register has been prepared which lists the brownfield sites that have potential to be used for future housing in the borough. 5.1.12 Havering has a wealth of heritage assets that make a significant and important contribution to the quality and character of the borough, the spatial strategy seeks to preserve and enhance these assets whilst also enabling new development and growth to take place. 5.1.13 The spatial strategy of this Local Plan is based very clearly on improved transport infrastructure being secured to support the growth that is expected in Havering. Havering’s transport infrastructure has remained largely unchanged for many years. It provides strong cross-borough connections (both road and rail) but journeys between the north and south of Havering are much less convenient because the transport infrastructure does not facilitate them. This adversely affects residents and businesses and must be addressed to support the growth envisaged in the Local Plan. 5.1.14 Successful delivery of the growth envisaged in the Local Plan will be dependent upon / facilitated by key strategic transport interventions including north-south linkages between Romford and Harold Hill and Rainham and Beam Park to improve connectivity between the main areas identified for new homes, jobs and business. 5.1.15 The Local Plan recognises that improvements to strategic transport linkages beyond Havering such as new river crossings across the Thames have the potential to impact on the borough. Havering will engage fully in discussions on these to ensure that opportunities are optimised and any adverse impacts mitigated. Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021 London Borough of Havering 13",

The area's significant growth potential is recognised through its anticipated designation by the Mayor of London as an Opportunity Area in the new London Plan. The Council aims to build on its positive relationship with the Mayor of London to further enhance Romford as a place to live and work and for businesses to invest. 6.1.4 There are a number of opportunity sites within the Romford Strategic Development Area which can accommodate housing growth. There is an increased demand for homes in east London, and with areas closer to central London becoming unaffordable to many, both demand and values will grow, especially with the arrival of Crossrail services. 6.1.5 Reflecting the significant opportunities that Romford offers and the importance of successfully integrating new schemes with existing developments and communities the Council is preparing a detailed Masterplan for Romford which will be taken forward as a Supplementary Planning Document. 6.1.6 The Havering Retail and Commercial Leisure Needs Assessment (2015) reports that whilst there is strong representation of multiple and independent retailers there is scope for the town centre to increase its market share of expenditure, some of which is currently leaking out of the borough to the Lakeside shopping centre in Thurrock. The retail offer within Romford needs to be upgraded to enable it to successfully compete with other centres and to retain its popularity as a comparison goods shopping destination, future-proofing the town centre and protecting its role and function as a metropolitan centre. 6.1.7 The Retail and Commercial Leisure Needs Assessment notes that demand is linked to the quality of provision. It recommends that new, larger-floorplan retail floorspace, involving the modernisation and amalgamation of existing retail premises, would attract additional retailers, particularly where this is provided in or close to the primary shopping area. Improvements to the quality of provision would also assist in diversifying the retail offer, helping to attract more middle and upper middle comparison goods retailers into the town centre. 6.1.8 South Street is integral to the fabric of the town but it includes many value retailers and small units. An improved retail offer here will cement and enhance Romford’s currently strong trading position. 6.1.9 The Brewery forms an important part of the retail offer within Romford but it turns its back to the centre. Better integration between the two is required, including a coordinated public realm programme to strengthen east-west connections. Opportunities for new development around the Brewery that intensify existing uses here should also be explored 18 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

      "content": "6.1.10 In addition to retail use, the Retail and Commercial Leisure Needs Assessment also considers the quality and provision of restaurant and café use (Use Classes A3 and A5). The study reports that the current provision is quite basic, serving a budget and youth market. There is a requirement across the borough for additional food and drink floorspace over the plan period, much of which should be directed towards Romford in the first instance, reflecting its role as a metropolitan centre. Diversification of the range and quality of restaurant use would bring wider benefits to the vitality and viability of the town centre. 6.1.11 The provision of existing A3 and A5 uses is mainly concentrated around The Brewery and South Street. The Market Place, with opportunities for outdoor seating and which The Retail and Commercial Leisure Needs Assessment states is ‘not currently fulfilling it’s potential as a large public space’, has potential to support additional A3 and A5 floorspace. 6.1.12 Market Place is one of Romford’s greatest assets and has potential to provide a key public space within the town centre. The emerging Romford Masterplan will set out proposals for the consolidation of the market allowing for the flexibility of the pubic realm. The Council will support a new cluster of cafés and restaurants around Market Place leading to longer dwell times and additional footfall in the north of the town centre. 6.1.13 There is a lack of green open space within the town centre. The only such space within the ring road is St. Edward the Confessor Church’s churchyard. However, there are a number of nearby parks a short walk beyond the ring road; these include Lodge Farm Park (off Main Road), and Cotton Park (at Mark’s Road). The Council will support development proposals that contribute to a greener Romford. 6.1.14 Investment at Romford railway station, linked to Crossrail, provides an opportunity for provision of taller buildings, making the most of excellent public transport accessibility and regeneration potential. Development should be of high quality design, co-ordinated and come forward as part of a planned cluster. 6.1.15 Proposed uses adjacent to the station should complement the wider mix of uses in the town centre, including new office space. The Council's Employment Land Review states that new, flexible space for smaller businesses is required, responding to changing economics. Provision of such space can be accommodated within refurbished buildings and new mixed-use development that also includes residential and ancillary support uses to help create an attractive and vibrant area. 6.1.16 The ring road creates a barrier to the town centre and an under whelming entrance for visitors. The Council will continue to use its Transport for London (TfL) Local Implementation Plan funding programme and will also look to secure future funding opportunities (including TfL’s Liveable Neighbourhoods programme) to design and deliver measures that support active travel and improve access into the town centre. Proposals for new development alongside the ring road should positively respond to the setting help overcome the barrier effect. 6.1.17 The River Rom, which runs north-south to the west of the town centre, is an under-utilised asset. The Council will work with the Environment Agency, land owners and developers to open up the river course as they bring development forward adjacent to the river. Consequently, the Council will require a co-ordinated approach to development that allows for a continuous pedestrian and cycle link to be provided along the River Rom. Provision of a new pedestrian and cycle link alongside the river will enhance the permeability of the town centre and provide for an attractive setting for living and active travel. In addition, Council would seek enhancements to the biodiversity value and water quality of the river in line with the requirements of Policy 31. 6.1.18 The Council is working closely with the Barking Havering Redbridge University Hospital NHS Trust (BHURT) on their emerging travel plan which will be monitored to ensure that progress is being made against targets for modal shift away from the car. There are currently 9 bus services (and a community bus) that access Queen's Hospital. Whilst this number of bus services accessing an outer London Hospital is very good, Queens has a very large catchment area and there continues to be pockets of the east London sub region that require at least two bus journeys in order to access Queen's. Additionally, the Council will continue to work with agencies such as the Clinical Commissioning Group and BHURT to explore the scope for services to be provided within the wider community to reduce the need for people to travel to Queen's.

      "content": "6.1.19 There is also a need to increase bus access here to provide people with an alternative to using private vehicles as parking spaces at the Hospital are at a premium. Work is currently being progressed on a detailed design of Queen's Hospital bus interchange where an additional bus stop is proposed to increase bus capacity and allow more bus routes to stop at Queen's Hospital. 6.1.20 The Council remains committed to working with its partners to secure significant improvements to Romford station to ensure that it provides an appropriate facility for rail users and is a safe, attractive and convenient place for rail journeys to, and from, Romford. Through TfL’s Crossrail Complementary Measures programme, the Council is delivering public realm improvements around the vicinity of Romford station to better integrate the station into its surroundings and to improve accessibility between the busy bus interchange south of Romford Station and the station entrances. 6.1.21 The land immediately adjacent to the River Rom and Black's Brook is predominantly located within fluvial Flood Zone 2 with small areas designated as Flood Zone 3b. To address flood risk development should consider the guidance in the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment: Annex A - Growth Areas Review and follow the requirements of Policy 32. 6.1.22 Education provision is particularly challenging in Romford. Existing schools within the area are already at full capacity, and whilst the Council's school expansion programme will assist in meeting future demand, this will not offer sufficient capacity over the Local Plan period. In order to meet the need for primary school places in the Romford area a 3 form of entry primary school (630 places) has been approved on the Bridge Close development site and the new school should be sufficient to meet demand for the additional primary places needed over the next five years. There is a further 6FE requirement for primary school places beyond the first five years. This will need to be delivered through new schools. This will be addressed via the Site Specific Allocation Plan or in the immediate update of this Plan that will identify specific sites for future schools. If further sites come forward for housing development the Council will need to assess whether further education provision will be needed. A 6/8FE secondary school is required in the second phase of the Plan period (5-10 years). The Council will seek to identify sites suitable for additional education provision through the Romford Masterplan and Site Specific Allocations Local Plan. 6.1.23 Due to the particular challenges in Romford and in advance of the delivery of the Site Specific Allocations Local Plan, the Council will require all development proposals that generate a primary school child yield equivalent to one additional form of entry to provide adequate space on site for the provision of a school or robustly demonstrate how this need will be accommodated through other developments. 6.1.24 When estimating the number of children that a new housing development will generate, and that will require a school place (yield), Havering takes account of the number of houses and flats that are suitable to accommodate children. Student and elderly accommodation are excluded. The primary school yield from qualifying homes is thirty pupils per one hundred homes (0.3 per dwelling). For secondary schools (including post 16 education or sixth form places) the yield is 20 pupils per 100 qualifying homes (0.2 per dwelling). 6.1.25 210 primary aged pupils represent one form of entry, across seven year groups, and this number is likely to be generated by approximately 700 new homes. However, this is dependant on the type and size of homes proposed and consequently sites delivering under 700 units may still generate a child yield that equates to one form of entry. Each proposal will be considered on a case by case basis. The reference to a minimum 700 units for primary and 3000 units for secondary triggering the need for part of the development site be set aside to provide a publicly funded school, are only average figures. The specific tenure and unit size breakdown for each development will be used to calibrate the charge yield using the publicly available GLA population calculator. 6.1.26 Growth and change in the town centre must be accompanied by improvements to the quality of the public realm. The Council’s Retail and Leisure Report identifies that there is significant scope to improve the appearance of the shopping streets in the town centre, that there is a lack of open space, trees and planting in the town centre, and that the ring road acts as a barrier to movement. An enhanced public realm will provide a pleasant and safe experience to encourage visitors to spend more time and money in the centre, and will support high quality development and other investment. 20 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

Some of these routes suffer from blank facades and terminate at the ring road where crossings are neither pedestrian nor cycle friendly. Some of these crossings are currently provided by way of subways. The ring road in particular creates a barrier to the town centre and an under whelming entrance for visitors. The Council will look to improve these routes. Proposed developments adjacent to these crossings will be expected to contribute to their improvement. Development should also seek to open up blank facades with new active frontages and entrances. 6.1.29 South Street is the main pedestrian area and acts as the north south spine through the town, connecting residential areas with the station, main retail area and historic cross roads with the High Street and the Market Place. However the quality of the public realm along this route is tired and in need of improvement. The Market Place is the main public space in the town centre, but is currently undermined through extensive provision of surface car parking which could be rationalised to enhance the quality, usability and enjoyment of this space. 6.1.30 The railway station is an important arrival point into the town centre where the quality of the public realm should be improved, with enhanced links to the town centre and new development creating active, overlooked and well-proportioned streets and spaces. This should include reconsideration of the current bus station and routes to and from this which currently undermine the pedestrian environment. 6.1.31 Tall buildings may be acceptable in the vicinity of the station subject to high quality design and strong public realm propositions at ground level. Proposals for tall buildings within the Conservation Area are inappropriate. The heights of proposed new buildings in this area will need to respond positively to the historic context. Elsewhere in the town centre the height of proposed buildings should respond to local character and context, and make a positive contribution to the skyline in Romford town centre. 6.1.32 A tall building is generally understood to be anything which is of significantly greater height than its context. As Historic England note in the Tall Building Advice Note 4: “In a successful plan-led system, the location and design of tall buildings will reflect the local vision for an area, and a positive, managed approach to development, rather than a reaction to speculative development applications”. To determine the appropriate scale, height and form of development with the Romford Strategic Development Area the Council have commissioned consultants to work with the Council to develop a masterplan for Romford Town Centre. This piece of work will involve analysis, characterisation and building height studies to provide evidence to support a local height definition for tall buildings and the identification of appropriate locations with the Romford Strategic Development Area for such buildings beyond the definition within the Local Plan. The Romford Masterplan is envisaged to be adopted as a Supplementary Planning Document and will therefore provide clarity in due course in this area.

In June 2015, following a successful bidding process, Rainham and Beam Park was identified as one of the GLA’s Housing Zones which is providing much needed investment to help secure and accelerate the delivery of new homes by overcoming barriers to development and supporting the provision of social and physical infrastructure in the area to create attractive new places to live.

The GLA are an important landowner in the area and are bringing forward the Beam Park site for residential and mixed use development with Countryside Properties PLC. 6.2.6 The Council is actively acquiring land along the A1306 corridor and will be procuring a development partner to bring forward these sites in joint venture partnership with Mercury Land Holdings. Outline planning applications are currently being brought forward for these sites. 6.2.7 The A1306 corridor (New Road) is currently in employment and industrial uses. Fronting the northern side of New Road are a mix of residential properties intermingled with car repair shops and car sales areas many of which are unsightly. Employment sites to the south of New Road are mixed but several are vacant and under-used. 6.2.8 The Havering Employment Land Review (2015) recommends a change away from industrial employment uses in this area (totalling 15.4ha) to assist in meeting the housing and wider regeneration needs of the borough. The release of the industrial elements will also allow the boundaries of the Rainham SIL to the south to be consolidated, helping maintain the integrity of that industrial employment designation while helping to maintain residential amenity in the Rainham and Beam Park area. 6.2.9 The Employment Land review recommended the retention of the Rainham Steel office building. The site is of a good quality and is compatible with the housing development that will take place in the area. However, if Rainham Steel were to relocate from this location, the Council would not wish to retain the site for industrial use due to its prominent location and close proximity to the new residential development. The Council will seek a residential redevelopment in this scenario. 6.2.10 To support the increased residential population at Rainham and Beam Park, a new local centre will be established at Beam Park Station. The Beam Park Local Centre will provide local shops and services in walking distance of both the western part of the development area and the existing residential areas to the north. The local centre will offer apartment living in its upper floors and will be focused around a new gateway space outside the station and a new street link with new road that provides high quality public realm. 6.2.11 Rainham is a locally important district centre and includes a supermarket, local shops, cafes and historic pubs, a rail station and a new library. The district centre will continue to have this role and also serve new residents in the eastern part of the A1306 development. 6.2.12 The central area in Rainham village is designated as a Conservation Area and comprises a number of listed buildings including the grade I listed church of St Helen and St Giles in the grade II* listed Rainham Hall. 6.2.13 For a number of years, Havering has been lobbying for a new station to be built at Beam Park to support the projected number of homes and jobs expected to be created in the London Riverside area. Beam Park station will provide direct access to Central London and is expected to open by 2020. 6.2.14 To support development planned south of the A1306 it is important that the A1306 is not perceived as a barrier for pedestrians and other road users. The Council has been allocated funding from TfL’s Major Scheme budget to develop a detailed design for improvements along the A1306 to improve the local environment and encourage the use of active travel. 6.2.15 New Road will be transformed into the Beam Parkway - a green street that is well defined and enclosed by residential buildings. It will form the main spine of the area, connecting the wider area with the two centres at Beam Park and in Rainham Village. A network of streets will provide permeability and connect the development areas internally and across New Road with existing streets to the north. 6.2.16 Currently employees wishing to access the Rainham Employment area can only do so directly by car, with the nearest bus services terminating at CEME (174) or going to Rainham Village (103, 372). The Council is working with TfL London Buses who are undertaking a London Riverside study which is looking at the bus network needs in response to planned development in the London Riverside area.

The NPPF requires local planning authorities to identify and meet their full objectively assessed needs for housing. 7.1.2 Havering forms part of the London-wide housing market area with all of the other London boroughs. The London Plan 2021 sets a ten year housing target for Havering of 12,850 new homes between 2019/20 and 2028/29 or 1,285 per annum. The previous London Plan set Havering an annual housing target of 1,170 per annum. The Local Plan period bridges the two London Plans.

The Council has worked with these authorities to prepare a sub-regional SHMA. A subsequent update has been prepared for Havering taking into account updated GLA household projections [(5)] The 2016 SHMA Update for Havering indicates that Havering's full Objectively Assessed Need is for 30,052 new homes over the period 2011-2033 or 1,366 homes per annum. 7.1.4 Through the Local Plan process, the Council has sought to identify all sources of potential housing supply and identify sustainable development sites in order to close the gap between the housing target set in the London Plan and its objectively assessed need requirement. With two Strategic Development Areas in Romford and in Rainham and Beam Park (both with Housing Zone status), an ambitious estates regeneration programme for its own homes, the establishment of the Council's own housing company, opportunities across a range of well located brownfield sites and working pro-actively and collaboratively with developers to bring forward sites in private ownership, Havering is making every effort to increase housing supply and deliver the homes that are needed in regard to both quantity and quality. 7.1.5 Over the first 10 years of the Plan period (2016-2026), the Council has identified capacity to deliver at least 13,095 new homes. This exceeds the minimum 10 year target set out in the London Plan but falls slightly short of meeting the objectively assessed need identified through the Outer North East London SHMA. The Council recognises that Havering's objectively assessed housing need is higher than its identified sources of housing capacity. Policy 3, therefore, sets out a positive and proactive approach to housing development to increase the supply over the plan period. As part of managing the overall approach to housing growth in Havering, the Council adopts a general presumption in favour of housing to meet the identified housing need in the borough, and prioritises housing use on all non-allocated land when it becomes available. 7.1.6 Due to the nature of the housing supply in the Local Plan, the Council has applied a ‘stepped’ approach to housing delivery over the first 10 years of the plan period. The ‘stepped’ approach targets are set out in Table 1. 4 *roll forward to London Plan 2021 targets 5 GLA 2015 Round Household Projections - Long Term Trends Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021 London Borough of Havering 29",

      "content": "7.1.7 The ‘stepped’ approach is explained and justified in detail within the Housing Position Paper 2019: Technical Update. It involves having phased housing targets that are lower in the first 5 years of the plan period (Phase 1). These targets then increase in the second five years of the plan period (Phase 2). The ‘stepped’ approach reflects the longer lead in times for the development of sites in the Strategic Development Areas and the Council’s estates regeneration programme. It represents a level of house-building that is achievable over the first 10 years of the plan period, while ensuring that Havering is able to meet its 10 year target. The targets are a minimum and should not preclude the development of more housing to meet the borough’s objectively assessed need, particularly within the first 5 years of the Plan period. 7.1.8 Through the Duty to-Co operate, the GLA have confirmed that London forms one housing market area and unmet housing need is being addressed at the London wide level, with all boroughs seeking to identify additional capacity over and above the level identified in the current London Plan. 7.1.9 The NPPF requires local planning authorities to identify and update annually a supply of specific deliverable sites sufficient to provide five years worth of housing against their housing requirements with an additional buffer of 5% (moved forward from later in the Plan Period) to ensure choice and competition in the market for land. Where there has been a record of persistent under delivery of housing, local planning authorities should increase the buffer to 20% (moved forward from later in the Plan Period) to provide a realistic prospect of achieving the planned supply and to ensure choice and competition in the market for land. 7.1.10 Over the period 2004/05 to 2016/17 Havering has met or exceeding its target in 5 years, and under delivered in 8 years. Havering’s delivery record is characterised by a mixture of over and under delivery connected to the peaks and troughs of the housing market cycle. It is recognised that previous delivery has not been at the level required and there has been persistent under-delivery. In light of this the 5 year housing land supply calculations as set out in the Council's Housing Position Statement 2019 have included a 20% buffer. 7.1.11 A significant proportion of new housing development will be delivered in the two Strategic Development Areas and predominantly on large sites within these areas. Work is already underway in Havering to bring these sites forward and whilst construction will start within the first five years of the Plan, completion is more likely to be towards the end of this period and into the second phase. The Council is making every effort to bring forward these sites as quickly as possible in order to boost housing supply and meet the short term need for housing. 7.1.12 Full details of the Council's land supply and the approach to housing delivery over a 10 year period is set out within the Housing Position Statement October 2019: Technical Update supporting this Local Plan. This also includes a Housing Implementation Strategy addressing the initiatives underway to increase housing supply. 7.1.13 The Housing Position Statement identifies specific deliverable and developable sites for the first 10 years of the Plan. The Housing Position Statement is based on the housing targets from the London plan 2016. The Council is committed to ensuring that there is a sufficient supply of housing over the 15 year plan period and beyond and will therefore undertake an early update of the Plan. The update will take into account the latest information relating to the London Plan 2021 target, any shortfall in delivery and updated supply. This update will begin immediately after adoption of the Local Plan. 7.1.14 As part of its strategy, the Council has looked at the scope for the Green Belt to provide land for new homes. It has undertaken a review against the functions of the Green Belt as set out in the NPPF. The Council is satisfied that all of the Green Belt in Havering fulfils its purpose and that having regard to the significant opportunities for new homes to come forward in Havering’s built up area, there is no planning justification for releasing land from the Green Belt. Opportunities do exist on previously developed sites within the Green Belt at St George's Hospital in Hornchurch and Quarles Campus in Harold Hill. 7.1.15 In seeking to meet its objectively assessed housing need the Council explored and tested a number of alternative development strategies in its Sustainability Appraisal (SA) Report. The SA report demonstrates that the development strategy chosen by the Council is the most sustainable approach. 7.1.16 The Council supports self-build initiatives in order to give local residents the opportunity to design, build and own their homes. Since May 2016, the Council has published a register for individuals and groups to express an interest in acquiring self-build and custom build plots in Havering.

However, the Council recognises that when determining an application, density is only one of a number of considerations. The density matrix should not be applied mechanistically. The Council will place a high priority on the quality and design of the scheme, the local context and the relationship with surrounding areas when determining whether a scheme is acceptable. It will always aim at optimising residential output and densities consistent with the London Plan for different types of location within the borough through encouraging higher densities of housing development in places with good levels of public transport accessibility.

      "content": "7.2.1 The Council is committed to securing the highest level of affordable housing contribution as the rise in average house prices in comparison to average income levels has made market housing unaffordable for many Havering residents. 7.2.2 The Outer North East London SHMA estimates that of the 30,052 new homes needed in Havering over the period 2011-2033, 35% (10,520) of these are required to be affordable. The Council, therefore, considers it appropriate to seek at least 35% affordable housing from new developments. This is also consistent with the London Plan and the Mayor's Affordable Housing and Viability Supplementary Planning Guidance (2017). 7.2.3 The Council has undertaken a Local Plan Viability Assessment to help inform the borough's affordable housing target. The Assessment found that in most cases, schemes can accommodate between 25% and 50% affordable housing with higher density flatted developments only likely to be able to achieve between 25% and 35% in the highest value locations. 7.2.4 Development proposals that meet or exceed the 35% or 50% thresholds without public subsidy, provide affordable housing on site, meet the specified tenure mix and all other requirements and obligations are not required to submit viability information. However, these applications will be subject to an early review mechanism which will be triggered if an agreed level of progress is not made within two years of permission being granted. The level of progress will be agreed with the applicant on a site by site basis. 7.2.5 The 50% threshold on Industrial Sites applies to Strategic Industrial Locations, Locally Significant Industrial Sites and Non-Designated Industrial sites appropriate for residential development where the scheme would result in a net loss of industrial capacity. 7.2.6 Public sector land is land that is owned or in use by a public sector organisation, or company or organisation in public ownership, or land that has been released from public ownership and on which housing development is proposed. 7.2.7 The Council supports a transparent approach to viability in line with the Mayor's Affordable Housing and Viability Supplementary Planning Guidance (2017). Applicants will be required to pay for an independent viability assessment by a third party where requested by the Council. The Council will use review mechanisms to ensure that new development delivers the appropriate amount of affordable housing as viability improves. 7.2.8 Developers should engage at a very early stage with Registered Providers of affordable housing to discuss the the delivery of the affordable element of the proposal. A Registered Provider should be identified before making a planning application. The affordable offer and any grant funding should be factored into any financial viability assessment. 32 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

      "content": "7.2.9 Where a development proposal is considered to under-develop a site, the Council will consider negotiating an increase in the number of dwellings, and thus affordable housing provision, or consider refusing the application. The Council has established that development sites of more than 1000 square metres are potentially able to be configured to deliver 10 or more residential dwellings and, therefore, contribute to affordable housing provision. 7.2.10 The Outer North East London SHMA identified two categories of need; those who can afford affordable housing for rent with housing benefit support and those who can afford affordable housing without housing benefit support and therefore require intermediate housing. In summary, the SHMA concludes that the vast majority of households in Havering can only afford social housing if they receive housing benefit. In light of these findings, the Council will seek a 70:30 tenure split between affordable rented and intermediate products. 7.2.11 There are a range of affordable and intermediate housing products on offer including Social Rent, London Affordable Rent, Affordable Rent, London Living Rent, Shared Ownership and Starter Homes. Havering’s approach is to encourage a mix of affordable housing tenures. The Council will set out the preferred split between specific affordable products within Havering's emerging Housing Strategy. 7.2.12 In line with national and regional planning policy, affordable housing should, in the first instance, be delivered on-site. Off-site provision may be considered in exceptional circumstances as set out in the Mayor of London's Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016). Where commuted sum payments are proposed by the applicant without the Council's agreement, for example, because there have been no pre-application discussions, the onus will be on the applicant to robustly justify to the Council why off-site provision or a commuted payment should be accepted. 7.2.13 In all circumstances where provision other than on-site is being considered, applicants will be required to draw on robust evidence to provide a statement that demonstrates; why affordable housing cannot be provided on-site, or in those cases where on-site provision is possible but does not result in the best housing outcome, how and why identified housing needs would be more effectively met off-site compared to on-site. 7.2.14 Details of the Council's financial model for calculating the value of a commuted sum will be provided in a Supplementary Planning Document. 7.3 Housing mix Table 4 Borough Wide Housing Mix |Col1|1bed|2bed|3bed|4+bed| |||||| |MarketHousing|5%|15%|64%|16%| |AffordableHousing|10%|40%|40%|10%| Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021 London Borough of Havering 33",

      "content": "7.3.1 There is a diverse population in Havering, with an equally diverse range of housing needs and requirements. Havering's residents require a mix of housing types at different stages in their lives and depending on their individual circumstances. It is important that there is a range of housing so that individuals or households can choose to pass through all phases of life living within the same neighbourhood, leading to improved community cohesion. 7.3.2 The key findings of the Outer North East London SHMA in relation to size mix show that over the Plan Period there is a significant need for three bed affordable and market properties. For market housing the Council will seek a size mix in line with the findings of the SHMA (as set out in Table 4). 7.3.3 In relation to affordable housing, the Council has considered evidence from both the SHMA and the current housing register. The combined evidence demonstrates that the Council’s priority through the Local Plan should be for 2 and 3 bed properties with 1 bed properties less of a priority. The Council’s preference is that 2 bed 4 person properties should be prioritised over 2 bed 3 person units as they offer greater flexibility of accommodation. 7.3.4 The Council does recognise that the high level of demand for three bed properties will be challenging and that it may not be possible to meet the recommended housing mix on all sites. Some sites, for example, may be more appropriate for families with children, particularly sites with safe access to amenity and play space. However, it is essential that the supply of family housing is stepped up to maintain an adequate stock of housing suitable for occupation as family dwellings. The Council will expect developers to demonstrate how they have sought to maximise the provision of family housing within their schemes. In flatted schemes, developers should be creative with their approaches to providing family accommodation and should demonstrate how they have considered the provision of family units such as duplexes at ground floor level. Where the recommended level of three bed properties cannot be achieved, the priority will be to provide two bed rather than one bed properties. 7.3.5 Proposals containing family housing (in this case units with 3 bedrooms or more) in excess of the above guidelines will be supported, provided that there are not high existing levels of family housing in an area, or there is a demonstrable need for such family housing in an area. There will be greater flexibility on the requirement for family units for proposals for retirement, sheltered or extra care housing. Justification for the dwelling mix proposed in development schemes is required, if differing from the mix set out in Table 4. 7.3.6 The preferred dwelling mix will be subject to periodic amendments based on up-to-date Council assessments of needs across the borough. Any amendments to this preferred mix will be published on the Council’s website or contained within a Supplementary Planning Document, as appropriate. 7.4 Specialist accommodation 34 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

In fact, Havering has the largest percentage of older people of all the London boroughs. There is a need to ensure that there is appropriate provision of specialist accommodation across the borough to meet this need including providing appropriate accommodation for those individuals suffering from Dementia. 7.4.3 Havering has just under 2,000 specialist housing units for older people across all tenures – including social housing, retirement accommodation, assisted living schemes and extra care housing. This does not include general needs housing that the Council has designated for older people. Over 60% of these specialist housing units are social housing, the vast majority of this being the Council’s own sheltered housing accommodation (approximately 800 units). 7.4.4 Today, older people's housing needs and choices are very different from previous generations. Changes in life expectancy, income levels and social expectations of life after retirement have all contributed to a re-imagining of housing options for older people, with an emphasis on independence, choice and enablement. 7.4.5 The London Plan states that boroughs should identify and address the local expression of older persons strategic housing needs, informed by indicative requirements set out in Annex A5 of the London Plan. Havering’s indicative requirement is identified as being 185 additional units per year. 7.4.6 In 2015, the Council commissioned a report to identify the locally expressed need for specialist older people’s housing within the borough. This report looked at both the current and projected need for housing for older people and the specific types of specialist accommodation required. This report employed a model which draws heavily on both the GLA’s model and the Housing LIN model, but then applies local information to ensure its relevance to Havering. The report found that: There is a current and projected surplus of affordable Sheltered Housing Schemes in Havering and this is projected to continue even with the projected growth in the number of older people living in Havering. There is a current and projected deficit in sheltered /retirement housing for lease and sale within Havering. There is a current and projected deficit in enhanced and extra care housing and specialist housing available for older people when their current home is no longer suitable due to physical and/or mental frailty or affordability. 7.4.7 In 2018, the report was reviewed and reached the same conclusions listed above. Overall, an annual need for 255 owner occupier/ intermediate housing was identified. The report will continue to be reviewed every 3 years so that the Council is able to maintain an up-to-date understanding of identified need within the borough, taking into account changes in demographic projection, technological and building innovations and older person’s assessment of how their own housing needs are best met.

Three of the four sites that are closing will be regenerated to provide high quality general needs housing and one will provide high quality general needs flats for residents over the age of 55. Of the three sheltered schemes for redevelopment, two will become Older People’s Villages offering a range of housing options designed to support a variety of needs within a community setting. One sheltered scheme will become an Extra Care scheme offering residents the benefit of additional support to meet increasing needs. 7.4.9 In addition, there will be considerable financial investment focused on the remaining twelve sheltered schemes over the next two years. This will enable the Council to improve facilities and services within sheltered schemes, which will support the needs of older people and encourage our residents to remain as independent as possible for as long as possible so improving their quality of life and reducing the financial burdens on local health and social care services. 7.4.10 There is a need for both specialist and long term housing solutions to be found for people with a learning disability, mental health conditions, substance misuse and older looked after children within Havering. Work is underway to identify the demand for supported housing as part of the Council's housing development programme work. 7.4.11 For residents with a special educational need and disability who have reached 16, the Council is developing an integrated post-16 strategy that will include identifying housing needs and setting out suitable housing options. This will include the development of further supported living schemes and work to ensure that existing housing options are identified, such as the ground floor flats or bungalows that enable individuals to live independently (with appropriate support) in the community. 7.4.12 All development proposals for specialist accommodation should meet an identified and up to date local need. It is important that any new provision reflects the requirements of the local community in terms of the type, location and design of accommodation. 7.4.13 Specialist housing should be located in areas that have good public transport connections and have access to essential services by walking and cycling. This will enable residents to integrate into the local community and avoid social isolation. 7.4.14 Careful consideration should be given to the design of specialist accommodation to ensure that it is tailored to the needs of the intended occupants and that it is easily adaptable for future occupants who may have different needs. Residents should have access to high quality and usable outdoor amenity space. In circumstances where the intended occupants are unlikely to use outdoor space, it will still be important for an attractive outlook to be provided which should incorporate soft landscaping. 7.5 Residential design and amenity 36 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

If people feel safe and comfortable in their homes then they are more likely to be positive about their surroundings and this can help ensure that they will wish to live and stay in an area and mix with their neighbours to create mixed, inclusive and integrated communities. Careful, high quality design is therefore required to ensure that new and existing residents have a good quality of life. Adequate privacy, amenity space, comfort and security are important design issues that contribute to the health and wellbeing of residents. Securing these benefits can help community cohesion and encourage people to put down roots and invest in an area. 7.5.2 The positioning and orientation of properties, including their windows and balconies, must be carefully considered to ensure that adequate privacy is maintained for everyone. In particular, habitable rooms and areas of private gardens close to dwellings should not be excessively overlooked by windows or balconies. Screening can reduce overlooking in these instances. All habitable rooms should contain at least one main window with an adequate outlook where nearby walls or buildings do not appear overbearing or unduly dominant. Loss of outlook arises from development taking place in close proximity to existing development and introducing or significantly increasing a sense of enclosure. 7.5.3 The Council will expect the impact of development proposals to be assessed following the methodology set out in the most recent version of Building Research Establishment’s (BRE) “Site layout planning for daylight and sunlight: A guide to good practice”. Depending on the scale of the development a Daylight and Sunlight Report may be required to fully assess the impacts. 7.5.4 New development in Havering should be of a high quality and offer a good quality living environment for residents. Dual aspect accommodation offers a range of benefits such as better daylight, a greater chance of direct sunlight for longer periods, natural cross ventilation, mitigating pollution, offering a choice of views, greater flexibility and adaptability. In line with the Mayor’s Housing SPG 2016 developments should minimise the number of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings that are north facing, or exposed to noise levels above which significant adverse effects on health and quality of life occur, or which contain three or more bedrooms should be avoided. 7.5.5 High quality green infrastructure and amenity space provides many benefits in terms of opportunities for recreation and leisure, and enhancing quality of life through improved health, reduced stress levels, child development through play spaces and interaction with the natural environment. 7.5.6 The fundamental design considerations for amenity space are its quality and usability. The size, shape and slope of amenity space is key to its usability. Awkwardly shaped, narrow and very steeply sloping amenity spaces should be avoided. In designing high quality amenity space, consideration should be given to privacy, outlook, sunlight, trees and planting, materials (including paving), lighting and boundary treatment. 7.5.7 The design and provision of private amenity space is particularly important in flatted schemes. Balconies should be incorporated into all flatted developments and should, as a minimum, be 1.5 metres in depth and in line with the Mayor's Housing SPG.

Communal amenity space will be expected on all flatted schemes and may be appropriate on some large housing schemes. Communal amenity space should be designed to be private, attractive, functional and safe. Its quality and management should encourage a sense of ownership and pride. 7.5.8 Where it is not possible or appropriate to provide private gardens and communal amenity space, roof gardens will normally be acceptable alternatives provided they do not result in overlooking which reduces the privacy of neighbouring residents or other occupiers within the development. 7.5.9 Proximity to public open space will be considered when assessing the adequacy of provision of private amenity space only where design and layout is of sufficient high quality and contributions are made through s106 for enhancements to existing open space. 7.5.10 In areas where restaurants, pubs, bars, and night clubs are already established prior to the development of new residential developments in the same area, developers are to include the Deed of Easement of Noise as part of the sales agreement. 7.6 Houses in multiple occupation 7.6.1 In 2015, the Council introduced two Article 4 Directions that removed permitted development rights to convert properties to Houses in Multiple Occupation. Evidence suggests a trend towards conversion of smaller dwellings to form HMOs including semi-detached and terraced houses, particularly within Brooklands, Romford Town, Heaton and Gooshays wards. Direction Art4/1/2015 requires planning permission for the formation of an HMO from any existing residential property type encompassing detached, semi-detached and terrace houses and flats anywhere within these wards. Direction Art4/2/2015 introduces the requirement for planning permission to be obtained for the formation of an HMO from any existing semidetached or terraced house or flat anywhere within the remainder of the borough. The change of use from a detached house to a HMO (use class C4) is not covered by the second Article 4 Direction. 7.6.2 The threshold of 10% HMOs per street has been applied in order to ensure there are mixed communities in the borough. The limit aims to prevent the concentration of HMOs in certain roads and certain areas within these roads and to ensure an even distribution of HMOs across the borough.

      "content": "7.6.3 The Council’s policies seek to deliver appropriate residential conversions whilst maintaining a supply of family housing; this policy is in line with the strategic housing need of the borough. The Outer North East London SHMA identified a need for three bedroom properties in the borough, meaning the conversion of small family homes to HMOs would have a particularly negative impact on the supply of family housing. In order to protect family housing, properties must be at lease 120sq m in order for a conversion to an HMO to be considered acceptable. 7.6.4 All HMOs will also be expected to comply with the East London HMO guidance which has been adopted by the Council and sets out quality and minimum living space standards. 7.7 Conversions and subdivisions 7.7.1 Subdivision of existing houses and conversion of commercial floor space have been important sources of additional housing in Havering, particularly for smaller households. The Council acknowledges that there is a shortage of housing and the need to consistently increase the supply of high quality housing to meet the needs of residents. However, given that the Outer North East London Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) reports a pressing need for family homes of 3 bedrooms or more for both affordable and market housing, this policy sets out the criteria whereby conversion and subdivision schemes will contribute to the supply of priority family accommodation in Havering. 7.7.2 The threshold of 120 sq m for the subdivision of houses has been set to enable the retention of smaller dwellings for smaller households of single persons and young couples on moderate income, while permitting houses with greater floor space to be subdivided to provide a range of dwelling sizes and types. The subdivision of existing small houses consisting of floor space below 120 sq m into two smaller units will therefore not be supported. 7.7.3 All new development of either conversion or subdivision will be required to provide at least one 3b4p family unit with a minimum of 74 sq m of floor space, and a 1b1p or 1b2p flat with a floor space range of 37 - 50 sq m. This is consistent with standards set out by the Department for Communities and Local Government in its 'Technical housing standards - nationally described space standard' (2015). It has been established that conversion or subdivision schemes with a floor space of 120sq m can accommodate the retention of a family unit alongside the provision of an additional unit which meet the minimum space standards. The family unit should be on the ground floor with access to private, good quality, usable amenity space. The threshold of 120 sq m for the subdivision of houses has been set to enable the retention of smaller dwellings for smaller households of single persons and young couples on moderate income, while permitting houses with greater floor space to be subdivided to provide a range of dwelling sizes and types. The subdivision of existing houses consisting of floor space below 120 sq m into two smaller units will therefore not be supported. 7.7.4 In the particular circumstances of subdividing a heritage asset, the Council recognises that a different dwelling mix may be required to enable development in order to retain distinctive townscape character, and the historic layout of the property. As such, flexibility will be applied in such instances. Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021 London Borough of Havering 39",

Intensification of these areas by development on gardens or backland may provide valuable sources for housing. Development of such sites can be difficult as there are often a number of constraints. They require sensitive development and high quality design to ensure that the character of the area and the quality of life of existing and future residents is maintained. Particular care needs to be taken with proposals involving areas with a well-established character such as Emerson Park and Hall Lane. 7.8.2 This policy must be read in conjunction with Policy 7 and Policy 26 as sufficient privacy and amenity space for existing and new properties and the character and appearance are particular considerations for garden and backland development. 7.8.3 Private gardens also provide, besides important amenity and privacy roles, important ecological, drainage and flood mitigation functions. As a form of green infrastructure, these functions should be considered when any loss of garden land is proposed in line with Policy 29. 7.8.4 Land suitable for backland development may be in multiple ownerships. This may mean that not every parcel will come forward at the same time. Proposals must, therefore, demonstrate that the proposed development is of an acceptable size and that undeveloped parcels would not be landlocked or prejudiced. A comprehensive scheme removes the need for multiple entrances to small unconnected parcels which collectively may have a negative impact on highway safety and visual amenity. 7.8.5 The application will need to demonstrate that consideration has been given to all the land that has potential for development including land outside the ownership/control of the applicant. The layout must demonstrate how the additional land can be developed and that its future development will not be prejudiced. The access will need to be of a standard suitable to serve a comprehensive development with provision within the layout to extend the access to serve all the additional land.

The Council recognises that because of factors such as the pressure for other land uses it is unlikely that there will be scope for sites in Havering’s urban area to address the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers and Travelling Showpeople. 7.9.4 The GTAA Update Report (July 2019) is supported by an up to date and detailed Pitch Deliverability Assessment to determine whether the current identified need for pitches could be accommodated within the existing boundaries of established sites. Further work based on this evidence has also encompassed looking at the scope for existing sites to be expanded to accommodate existing and future needs where the households on a site have ownership or control of adjoining land. This work encompassed assessing the capacity of individual sites to accommodate further accommodation units of the types typically used by Gypsy and Traveller families including park homes, touring caravans and ‘day-rooms’. It provided for reasonable separation between units and access arrangements. It did not encompass detailed feasibility studies as to the capability of sites to accommodate further units. In assessing the scope for sites to accommodate current and future accommodation needs of Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling Showpeople households, the Council has been assisted by the Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021 London Borough of Havering 43",

Many households indicated their willingness to take a flexible and pragmatic approach to meeting their accommodation needs through a combination of shared static caravans, tourers and dayrooms rather than more formally set out sites with separate pitches. This was because this would provide the opportunity for households to remain together rather than be accommodated on different sites. It is recognised this approach has practical merit in enabling households to remain together in the short term. Regular review and update of the GTAA will be required, and undertaken, to ensure that future accommodation needs are properly identified and that overcrowding of sites is avoided. 7.9.5 The GTAA Update Report (July 2019) identifies that all Gypsy and Traveller families living in Havering currently occupy private sites within the Havering Green Belt. There are no public sites within the borough and there are no sites in the built up area. The biggest constraint when trying to identify suitable land to meet the need for Gypsy and Traveller pitches in Havering is the Green Belt. 7.9.6 National planning policy says that Gypsy and Traveller pitches are inappropriate development in the Green Belt and can only be permitted in very special circumstances. However, despite repeated and extensive efforts, the Council has not been able to identify any suitable and deliverable non-Green Belt land within the built-up area that could be used for Gypsy and Traveller accommodation. 7.9.7 The policy seeks to meet the needs identified in the GTAA Update report (July 2019) through the allocation, regularisation, intensification or appropriate expansion of existing Gypsy and Traveller sites within the Havering Green Belt. This follows the Council’s conclusion that exceptional circumstances can be demonstrated from a significant level of need for pitches for Gypsies and Travellers; a lack of any alternative suitable and deliverable non-Green Belt land; and that the allocation, regularisation, intensification or expansion of established sites would cause no further harm to the Green Belt subject to proposals satisfying the criteria in the policy. 7.9.8 Through the preparation of this Local Plan, the Council is removing these sites from the Green Belt and ‘insetting’ them within it. This is so that planning applications for Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople accommodation on these sites do not need to demonstrate very special circumstances to be approved. The Council wishes to make it clear that these alterations to the Green Belt boundary are limited and exceptional in order to meet the specific identified needs for Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople sites. 7.9.9 Although the sites allocated in this policy for Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling Showpeople households are removed from the Green Belt, the Council emphasises that the only acceptable use of these sites will be for accommodation for Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople. 7.9.10 The Council will expect planning applications to be submitted from the adoption of this Local Plan to ‘regularise’ these sites. All planning applications for these sites will be assessed against the relevant policies of this Local Plan and Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (2015). Proposals will be expected to provide a satisfactory residential environment for the occupiers on the site. (a) Need for pitches for Gypsy and Traveller households who met the planning definition in Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (2015) 7.9.11 The GTAA Update report (July 2019) identifies a 15-year need for 174 pitches for Gypsy and Traveller households who met the planning definition of a Traveller as set out in the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (PPTS) (2015).

In the event that the households involved wish to remain in Havering, the Council will expect them to submit planning applications for pitches at one of the seven sites indicated in the policy as the broad locations for growth for the period 2021- 2026 (see para. 7.9.22). 7.9.15 The sites where an allocation has been made are identified on the Policies Map and listed in Annex 6. These allocations include any existing temporary or unauthorised pitches. The table in Annex 6 identifies the numbers of pitches that can be accommodated on each of the allocated sites. b) Need for pitches for Gypsy and Traveller households in Havering who did not meet the planning definition in Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (2015) 7.9.16 The GTAA Update report (July 2019) identified a 15-year need for 43 pitches for households that did not meet the planning definition of a Traveller. Of these, a total of 33 pitches are needed in the first 5 years of the Local Plan period (2016-2021) and a further 10 pitches are needed in the latter part of the Local Plan period (2021-2031). All of this need arises from existing sites located in the Green Belt.

These allocations include any existing temporary or unauthorised pitches. (c) Need for pitches from ‘undetermined’ households 7.9.19 The GTAA also identified need for up to 3 pitches for ‘undetermined’ households.

In practice, the Council will have initiated a full review of the Local Plan immediately after its adoption. This will provide the opportunity for a comprehensive review of how accommodation needs may be addressed. 7.9.21 In the light of the other land-use priorities in Havering, particularly, the need to provide enough new homes, the Council considers that it may be unlikely that adequate sites will be identified in the built up areas. Notwithstanding that, at this stage, the Council considers that the work it has undertaken to support the preparation of this Local Plan (paragraph 7.9.4) provides it with up to date and robust information about the potential, if necessary, for existing sites to accommodate further growth in either their current form or with modest expansion into adjoining land that is within the control of the households occupying the current sites. The Council considers that in the event that sites in the urban area cannot be identified or would not provide enough capacity then growth in years 6-10 could be located on some of the existing sites in the Green Belt or extensions to them. In coming to this conclusion, the Council has also taken into account that it is likely that there may be changes to the levels of needs arising from the existing households and these will be identified in a future update of the GTAA. 7.9.22 Following detailed work (see paragraph 7.9.4 above), existing Gypsy and Traveller sites (see below) have been identified to accommodate Gypsy and Traveller household growth in years 6-10 of the Plan period (2021-2026) and those Gypsy and Traveller households whose accommodation needs (identified in the GTAA Update report (July 2019) as 7 pitches) in the first 5 years of the Local Plan period cannot be met on their current unauthorised sites. 7.9.23 These sites are: Ashlea View, Tomkyns Lane Church Road Haunted House Wood Laburnham Stables The Old Forge, Hubbards Chase Tyas Stud Farm Willow Tree Lodge 7.9.24 When considering planning applications for Gypsy and Traveller pitches, the Council will take into account the policy criteria outlined in Policy 11 in addition to the requirements of national policy. (e) Travelling Showpeople in Havering 7.9.25 As identified above in paragraph 7.9.2, the GTAA Update Report (July 2019) identified that there are 5 Travelling Showpeople households in Havering and all meet the planning definition in national planning policy. The households living on the existing yard stated that they are looking to expand the yard on to adjacent land that they own, and that this will meet all of their current and future needs. The Council envisages that planning applications for the expansion of the Travelling Showpeople site (identified in Annex 6) will be considered favourably subject to the criteria in national policy and this policy being satisfied. 46 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

The GTAA Update Report (July 2019) indicates that the majority were short-term visiting family or friends, transient and passing through the borough. Since 2016, there has been an increase in the number of encampments on industrial land that have involved the criminal dumping of waste. It is considered that transit provision would not address any issues related to this activity. Under these circumstances, the Council does not intend to provide any new transit pitches or emergency stopping places. It will monitor the movements of gypsy and travellers into Havering and it will continue to use management arrangements (including enforcement action) for dealing with unauthorised encampments.

There is an urgency to improve health and wellbeing for the local population and decrease health inequalities. The Local Plan has the potential to decrease health inequalities in the borough and plan for healthy communities. The Council recognises that health and wellbeing is influenced by the impact of the built and natural environment and the interplay between the environment and social conditions. It is important to design places that encourage social interaction and promote health lifestyles, for example by designing out environments that can contribute to obesity and that provide opportunities for crime and antisocial behaviour. 8.1.2 It is important that the health and well-being of a buildings occupants is considered and appropriate measures taken to prevent sick building syndrome. Therefore, all new developments - residential, business, commercial, and industrial - need to comply with the Building Regulations and the Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) Guide on building control systems. 8.1.3 The Council has undertaken a Health Impact Assessment for the Local Plan to make sure that policies optimise the health outputs of new development (see Annex 5). 8.1.4 To ensure that health and wellbeing is given full consideration in the future development of the borough a Health Impact Assessment should be undertaken by developers for all major developments. HIAs can help to identify aspects of development that can be enhanced to achieve the greatest health gains and where there is a need to mitigate for any potential negative impacts.

The largest proportion of the retail and commercial leisure development will be accommodated within Romford Metropolitan Town Centre, and the reminder spread across the district centres where further scope for development and enhancement has been identified. This extra comparison retail space will not be required until after the Local Plan has been reviewed.

The PPG sets out what issues should be considered in establishing a local threshold for impact assessments. A key consideration is the viability and vitality of town centres. The Havering Retail & Commercial Leisure Needs Assessment (2015) sets out the performance of the metropolitan and district centres in Havering. It notes that the vitality and viability between town centres differs. Elm Park and Collier Row are vulnerable, as being at risk from removal from the London Plan district centre level. Protection from out of centre developments that could draw significant amounts of footfall is therefore recommended by the study. Although overall performing well, the other district and metropolitan centres have a number of vacancies in prominent locations. The vitality and vitality of these town centres could therefore also be adversely impacted by out of centre development. 8.2.4 Another consideration is the impact on planned assessment in town centres. Significant investment has been planned in the Romford and Rainham and Beam Park SDAs. The former includes Romford Metropolitan Centre and the latter includes Rainham District Centre and the new Beam Park Local Centre. To make sure that out of centre proposals do not adversely affect the vitality and viability of existing town centres, and make sure future investments are optimised, the setting of a significantly lower locally specific threshold for impact assessments than that specified in the NPPF is justified. With regards to the average size of retail premises in town centres district centres in Havering are made up mostly of small shops, with the average floor space being below 200 sq m. In Romford the average floor space is generally higher, although this varies between frontages. The threshold for impact assessments for edge and out of town centre development is therefore set at 200 sqm in the Local Plan. 8.2.5 The borough’s town centres provide important opportunities for social interaction, and community life, and as good places to live. In this regard, the Council will seek to assure their vibrancy through promoting and supporting the diversification of uses and the development of uses that remedy deficiencies within the town centres. However, in promoting diversification of development and uses, the Council is concerned to ensure that the retail function of town centres is not undermined. In promoting diversity acceptable upper floor uses would include residential, office and leisure uses. Subject to the Council being satisfied that an appropriate residential environment will be provided, residential development at the ground floor level in town centres may be encouraged in locations beyond the designated frontages such as an periphery of centres. In terms of shop front design, laminated glass and internal security grills are preferred above external shutters. 8.2.6 The Council has designated primary and secondary frontages within its metropolitan centre and six district centres. These are shown on the Policies Map with a schedule of properties within these frontages listed in Annex 6. These designated frontages are the primary shopping areas within the borough's metropolitan and district centres. 50 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

Use Class A1 should be the principal land use as this contains the most important shopping facilities, those which attract the greatest number of customers and those which contribute most to the vitality and viability of the respective centres. Due to the Permitted Development rights regarding the change of use from A1 to A2 uses it is justified to set a combined percentage for A1 and A2 uses. This is established at 60% to allow town centres to further diversify while maintaining the primary shopping function at a reasonable level. 8.2.8 In secondary frontages and local centres, the Council will seek to maintain a significant proportion of retail uses. However, a wider mix of uses will be promoted, especially those non-retail uses that provide services which complement shopping facilities. Such uses should provide active frontages, support street activity and generate a similar level of pedestrian movement to a retail use, and are open during the day (retail hours). 8.2.9 The concentration of particular uses can impact negatively on the amenity of adjacent uses and adversely affect the vitality and viability of the town centre. Policy 13, therefore, seeks to provide a balanced mix of uses within the town centres while preserving the primary shopping function of frontages. Therefore, restrictions for A5 uses (hot food take-aways), betting shops and pay day loan shops are included. Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021 London Borough of Havering 51",

These uses can, nevertheless, cause considerable pedestrian and vehicular activity which is likely to be greater than a retail use. This conflict can be made worse where there is a concentration of these uses within a locality. The main purpose of this policy is to control both the operation and location of restaurant uses so as to minimise their adverse impacts. 8.3.2 In determining whether a proposal would have adverse impact on amenity, the Council will take into account the proposed opening and closing hours, the proximity to residential and other sensitive land uses, the number, location and capacity of such uses already existing in the immediate area and the likelihood of noise and disturbance to nearby or adjacent residents, particularly at the weekend and late at night. Late closing uses should generally be located in the town centres and near places of entertainment. 8.3.3 In addition, where cooking smells and fumes will be created, the Council will require the installation of ventilation and fume extraction equipment. If this would be detrimental to visual amenity then planning permission may be refused. Where there is residential accommodation on upper floors, the Council will normally require ducting to discharge above eaves levels and the provision of adequate soundproofing. The Council will require submission with the planning application of the full details of ventilation and fume extraction equipment showing location of the flue and motor, dimensions, colour/material, model and noise levels. It will also require details of the refuse containment facilities. 8.3.4 In some areas the protection of residential amenities will demand more restricted opening hours and, where appropriate, the Council will impose these as conditions on planning permissions. Applicants are reminded that there may be licencing requirements for the uses supported by this policy. 8.3.5 In considering applications for outdoor sitting areas on pavements, the Council will take into account the impact of the use on local amenity and highway safety and will only support applications where the table and chairs are removable and are contained within a barrier/defensible space that is also removable. 8.3.6 It must be noted that as a general principle, the Council seeks to encourage well managed and operated restaurants and drinking establishments in its town centres and other appropriate locations, and to prevent any concentrations of such uses that would harm the attractiveness of Havering’s town Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021 London Borough of Havering 53",

Culture plays a valuable role in place shaping with cultural developments creating a sense of place and belonging within the community. Such developments include theatres, art spaces, museums, galleries, libraries, and work spaces for creative industries. 8.4.2 The Council recognises the important contributions the cultural and creative sectors including entertainment facilities and related services play in its economic and social success.

However, this cannot always be achieved as provision in some facilities lend themselves to be located in existing residential areas. It should be demonstrated that adverse impacts are appropriately mitigated where facilities generate movement and potentially affect the residential character and amenity of the area, 8.5.4 In line with the London Plan new social infrastructure is expected to be accessible for all, and to extend the use to serve the wider community.

It also helps to meet the growing demand for facilities, and is for example applicable to facilities on educational sites. 8.5.5 Following recommendations of the Indoor Sport and Leisure Facility Strategy (2016), where relevant, Community Use Agreements (CUA) will be secured to ensure dual use through s106 planning obligations. The development and implementation of CUAs can help support well-managed and safe community access to facilities on educational sites.

The consolidation and modernisation of community facilities in accessible locations where multi-functional facilities can meet the needs of a range of users will be considered.

If the disposal of assets is part of an agreed programme of social infrastructure consolidation, the loss of social infrastructure in the areas of defined need may be acceptable. The Council will also give consideration to the viability of retaining existing social infrastructure provision. This process, as well as the disposal of surplus or redundant assets will need to be managed to ensure that critical uses are not lost from the local area. 8.5.8 The future demand for burial space in the borough has been identified through the Council's Infrastructure Delivery Plan. Sufficient supply of multi-faith/interdenominational plots has been identified for the full Local Plan period. With regards to demands for burials meeting specific Muslim requirements arising from the wider North East London, including Havering, sufficient capacity has been identified until around 2024. The Council will support burial provision when the local need for such facilities can be demonstrated, based on up-to-date evidence. 8.6 Education 8.6.1 The Council is committed to ensuring that there is a good school within reach of every child in the borough.

The Council's expansion programme details the proposals putting forward to deliver much-needed extra early years, primary, secondary and SEN places. 8.6.2 The number of primary age pupils in Havering schools is expected to increase significantly from 21,074 in 2015/16 to 28,889 by 2025/26, and the number of secondary age pupils from 14,584 to 19,766 over the same period. These represent increases in demand for school places of 7,815 at primary level and 5,182 at secondary level over the period. 8.6.3 Current data for Havering suggests that an expected rise in the participation rate to full participation of 16 and 17 year-olds from 2015 will, to a large degree, be cancelled out by a fall in numbers of young people aged 16-18 in the next few years. However, in the longer term, the number of 16 and 17 year olds in Havering is projected to increase from 9,043 in 2016/17 to 10,318 in 2023/24. There is a range of options for pupils in this age group including sixth forms, colleges, and apprenticeships. Numbers on roll at Havering College of Further and Higher Education and Havering Sixth Form College are projected to increase by around 200 and 240 over this period, respectively. 8.6.4 These figures are the emerging position. The school roll projections are updated on an annual basis. The latest figures can be viewed in the Council's approved Commissioning Plan for Education Provision [(6)] . 8.6.5 New primary school provision will be required in Rainham and Beam Park and in Romford to meet the expected level of housing growth (refer to Chapter 6). Outside of these areas demand is expected to be accommodated through current provision and the expansion of existing schools. The Council will continue to monitor the quantum of residential development that comes forward outside of the two key growth areas and will consider the cumulative impact of development on the need for additional school places. Where the cumulative impact indicates that additional provision will be needed this will be set out in the Council's Commissioning Plan which is updated annually. There may be some areas of Havering where if further major housing is brought forward, there will be no available options to expand existing schools. As such, school place demand arising from such developments will need to be met through new school provision that will require a site to enable delivery. 8.6.6 The Department for Education gives area guidelines for mainstream schools. In certain locations, particularly urban town centres, these guidelines can be difficult to achieve. Innovative design solutions should be considered in order to provide a school that sufficiently serves its pupils. These could include use of roofs for outdoor space, co-location with other uses, and shared use of facilities, including parks, sports pitches and Multi-Use-Games-Areas (MUGAs), particularly when located close by. 8.6.7 A number of Havering's schools are located within the Green Belt. In accordance with the NPPF, the construction of new buildings should be regarded as inappropriate in Green Belt. Inappropriate development is, by definition, harmful to the Green Belt and should not be approved except in very special circumstances. Very special circumstances will not exist unless the potential harm to the Green Belt by reason of inappropriateness, and any other harm, is clearly outweighed by other considerations. The Council consider that very special circumstances may exist where there is a demonstrable need for school places and it can be robustly demonstrated that there are no other suitable non Green Belt sites. Such proposals will be considered on a case by case basis. 8.6.8 Access to adequate, affordable and high quality childcare (pre-school and school age) provision can play a key role in children’s development. Where it enables increased parental employment rates of low income households, it may also help to reduce income inequalities. In Havering, the predicted 19% increase in population of 0-14 year olds between 2016 and 2026 means that additional childcare places need to be found. The Childcare Act 2006 places a duty on local authorities to ensure that there are enough childcare places to enable parents to work or train, and also to ensure that there are sufficient funded early education places for all three and four-year olds within the local authority area. In Havering the demand for funded 2, 3 & 4 year old places is predicted to increase from 5,900 in 2015/16 to 6,800 in 2025/26. 8.6.9 Childcare facilities should be safe, accessible for all, and provide both indoor and outdoor learning opportunities. There has been an increase in Havering in planning applications for nurseries in residential areas. Although these proposals can contribute towards meeting a local need, it is important 6 [https://www3.havering.gov.uk/Pages/Services/School-organisation-place-planning.aspx](https://www3.havering.gov.uk/Pages/Services/School-organisation-place-planning.aspx) 58 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

The type of dwelling and relation to neighbouring dwellings will therefore be considered in determining proposals involving nurseries. From September 2017, working families will be entitled to up to 30 hours of childcare per week for 3 and 4 year olds, subject to the eligibility criteria for the additional free entitlement.

      "content": "8.7.1 Havering's extensive range of open spaces, leisure and sports facilities are highly valued by residents and make a significant contribution to their health and well being and overall quality of life. Access to good quality open space and sports facilities promotes healthy lifestyles by providing opportunities for relaxation, physical activity, social interaction and play. Open space and outdoor sports pitches can also play an important role in reducing the impacts of climate change, flooding and poor air quality. They also contribute to Havering's green and open character. 8.7.2 In applying Policy 18, open space will encompass parks and gardens, natural and semi natural green spaces, amenity space, children's play areas, allotments and cemeteries, churchyards and other burial grounds as defined in Havering's Open Space Assessment Standards Paper (2016). In addition waterways are also included as open space recognising their sport, recreation and amenity value, consistent with the definition of open space in the NPPF. Sports and recreation facilities encompass indoor sports halls, swimming pools, fitness centres, outdoor sports pitches, playing fields, tennis courts and bowling greens. 8.7.3 Havering's Open Space Assessment and Standards Paper (2016) assesses the current quantity, quality and distribution of open space within Havering and considers the demand for future provision to meet the needs of Havering's growing population. The study covers 177 sites totalling 1,283 ha. There is generally a good coverage of parks, gardens, natural and semi natural spaces and amenity greenspaces across the borough. It is acknowledged that there are some areas of deficiency, although deficiency in one type of open space is often met by another type of open space. The priority is, therefore, to protect current provision and support improvements in quality and accessibility. 8.7.4 New residential and mixed use developments provide opportunities to incorporate new amenity greenspace and parks within the built up area and this will further enhance current provision. Natural and semi natural spaces are typically found on the edge of the urban areas in Havering and the inclusion of natural and semi-natural features as part of new developments will enhance existing provision. 8.7.5 Allotment provision in Havering does not meet the suggested standard of 0.25 hectares per 1,000 population from the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners (NSALG). There is also a high level of demand with waiting lists for plots across the borough. It is, therefore, important to safeguard and enhance existing allotment plots in order to meet current and future demand. The Council is supportive of innovative ways of providing food growing and gardening opportunities, particularly through community gardens and dedicated growing spaces within in new developments. 8.7.6 Play facilities that are safe and stimulating are essential for a child’s well-being, health and future development. Whilst Havering has a good amount of, and generally good quality provision of, open space for children and young people it is important that opportunities to increase provision and quality are taken. Residential and mixed use proposals should incorporate or contribute to new play space based on the child yield expected from the development in accordance with the requirements of the London Plan and the associated Play and Informal recreation Supplementary Planning Document. 8.7.7 Havering's Outdoor Playing Pitch Assessment and Strategy (2016) assesses the current quantity, quality and distribution of outdoor sports facilities within the borough and considers the demand for future provision. The study covers outdoor football, rugby, cricket, artificial grass and softball pitches, outdoor tennis courts and bowling greens. The assessment identifies some current and future shortfalls in provision and recommends therefore, that all currently used sports pitches should be protected and their quality improved where appropriate. Shortfalls in provision can also be met by bringing back into use lapsed or disused playing field sites that formerly accommodated playing pitches. School sites are a key provider of outdoor sports facilities and the Council will seek to maximise the shared community use of these assets. 8.7.8 It is essential that Havering has modern and fit for purpose indoor sports facilities and the Council is actively seeking to upgrade the current provision. Havering's Indoor Sport and Leisure Facilities Assessment and Strategy (2016) found that investment is needed in both community and school sports facilities. Provision has been significantly enhanced by the new Romford Leisure Centre and will be further enhanced with the replacement of Hornchurch Leisure Centre, a new leisure centre to serve the south of the borough and improved facilities at Bretons Outdoor Recreation Centre. 60 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

Strategic Outer London Development Centres (SOLDC) are business locations with specialist strengths which potentially or already function above the sub-regional level and generate growth significantly above the long term outer London trend.

Havering will work with the Mayor of London and other stakeholders to identify, develop and promote SOLDC within it to realise its potential in logistics activities. 9.1.4 Strategic Industrial Locations (SILs) are locations identified by the Mayor of London, following assessment of future demand, as London's main reservoir of industrial land. They are identified as vital for providing capacity for activities such as logistics, waste management, utilities, land for transport, and industrial 'services to support the service sector', and they are accorded strategic protection by the Mayor of London and London boroughs. The Locally Strategic Industrial Sites (LSISs) are sites identified by the Council as vital for local industrial functions, including availability of low rent accommodation, which support a range of local employment. The Council nevertheless realise the importance of addressing other strategic and local land-use requirements, in particular the pressing need for new homes. The Council will, therefore, keep under review the need for employment land as part of a managed approach in line with the requirements in the National Planning Policy Framework and the London Plan and with regard to meeting the other objectives of this Local Plan. 9.1.5 The Havering Employment Land Review (ELR) (2015) found that there is a gross demand for 350 hectares of industrial land (B2 and B8) in Havering over the Local Plan period up to 2031/2. It notes that the vast majority of the existing Strategic Industrial Locations (SILs) are located away from residential areas with direct access to the strategic road network. The Locally Significant Industrial Sites (LSISs) are well functioning industrial employment areas with an on-going demand for space to service industrial and logistical occupiers. They are areas that remain the most suitable locations for accommodating Havering’s industrial and warehousing demand. The Review also recommends the designation of Freightmaster Estate in Rainham as a Strategic Industrial Location. 9.1.6 The ELR advises that 24ha of employment land can be released over the Plan period. The previously designated land recommended for release comprises 2.7 ha at Crow Lane (Romford gas works), 15.4 ha at Rainham West and 1.4 ha at Bridge Close, Romford. The de-designation of these sites will facilitate the delivery of new residential developments and make a significant contribution towards meeting the borough's housing need. Safeguarding SILs and the remaining LSISs will ensure that there is sufficient capacity to meet projected demand for industrial land in the borough going forward over the plan period. 9.1.7 The London Riverside SIL Employment Area is a thriving commercial area with a variety of businesses and occupiers including the Centre for Engineering and Mechanical Excellence (CEME) which is a centre for research, business support, skills and education. Within the SIL, there is a successful and active Business Improvement District which represents existing businesses and works with the Council and Greater London Authority to attract investment. Current development across the wider SIL includes the construction of 334,000 sq ft of new commercial space at SEGRO Park. 9.1.8 The high quality of the environment within designated industrial areas is an essential component of the attractiveness and competitiveness of these areas. By their nature some industrial uses may legitimately generate noise and odour or require open storage of materials. It is important that these uses are able to operate without undue adverse impact on other 'cleaner' industrial uses. The Council does, however, recognise that environmental improvements are required in specific parts of the borough's industrial areas to ensure that valuable businesses are attracted to and retained within Havering. 9.1.9 Salamons Way in the Rainham Employment Area has a number of existing premises that are in good condition and well maintained. However, the majority of buildings are in a poor condition and the general appearance of the area is exacerbated by the nature of some activities. With large areas of open storage land, the utilisation of land is inefficient. The highway is unadopted, and in poor condition. The Council will support redevelopment of all or part of the area to facilitate a modern business area with good environmental standards and an enhanced image. 9.1.10 Regarding office development, the ELR’s forecast demand assessment identified a net additional demand of up to 17,132 sq m of B1 floorspace over the plan period across Havering. The report assessed Havering as standing to benefit from office occupiers seeking better value office accommodation as office rents rise closer to the centre of London and land availability reduces as employment land comes under pressure from higher value residential uses. The London Office Policy Review (2012) underlines this and recommends that office development in Romford Town Centre is delivered as part of mixed-use schemes led by other uses.

It is anticipated that new public transport investment such as Crossrail which passes through Romford and the consequent demand to be stimulated from potential outmigration of businesses from central London looking for lower office rents in accessible locations will likely result in an uplift in demand for offices in Romford. Development in the former Office Quarter and elsewhere in Romford Town Centre should explore opportunities to provide high quality flexible and smaller size studios, workshops and office workspace units as part of mixed-use schemes to accommodate the needs of smaller and medium sized businesses. This could be provided above shops, as part of a mixed use regeneration scheme or in existing office space when there is capacity. Mixed use schemes with active ground floor uses in district centres will also be supported. 9.1.12 In further demonstrating its commitment to being business friendly, the Council will support the sustainable growth and expansion of businesses and enterprises in the rural area, subject to proposals meeting the NPPF Green Belt policy requirements, by encouraging well designed new buildings and promoting the development and diversification of agricultural and other land-based rural business and by promoting the retention and development of local services and community facilities in villages, such as local shops,sports venue, meeting places, public houses and places of worship. 9.2 Loss of industrial land 9.2.1 Locally Significant Industrial Sites (LSISs) are of local significance for industry and warehousing. Non-designated industrial land and floorspace comprises land and floor space last used for employment use or land and floorspace which is currently in employment use but does not lie within the area identified and safeguarded as a Strategic Industrial Location (SIL) or a Locally Significant Industrial Site (LSIS). 9.2.2 In line with the focus on a strong economy in Havering, the purpose of Policy 20 is to protect and where possible enhance the employment potential of the existing Locally Significant Industrial Sites and non-designated employment land and floorspace. 9.2.3 Although the focus of Policy 20 is to seek to protect Locally Significant Industrial Sites and non-designated industrial land, the Council recognise that the policy should provide for some flexibility in the extent to which industrial land is safeguarded. Some scope for flexibility is important because the Council recognises that in Havering there is considerable pressure to accommodate a range of important land uses including housing and infrastructure as well as industrial / employment. In taking this approach, the Council will always carefully consider up to date evidence as to how the proposed 64 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

It will also examine information arising from the marketing of the site to ensure that the site / land is genuinely surplus to employment requirements. 9.2.4 As already noted in Policy 19 on Business Growth, the Havering Employment Land Review (ELR) (2015) identified 19.5 hectares of land previously designated for its local significance and an additional 4-5ha from non-designated employment uses to be released over the Plan period making the overall amount of employment land to be released not greater than 24 ha. To allow for a loss bigger than the recommended 24 hectares benchmark would undermine Havering’s economic development objectives. Companies seeking to expand or start a business in Havering in the future may not have sufficient land or business premises to do so. There are approximately 50 hectares of non-designated industrial sites remaining in the borough. These generally perform well as employment areas, meeting the needs of local businesses. By resisting further erosion of this type of employment land and floorspace this policy is seeking to maintain business land and spaces for local business. 9.2.5 As part of managing the overall approach of housing delivery in Havering, the Council recognises that there may be locations where the quality of residential environment is being compromised by the operation of nearby industrial use, for example due to noise or access issues. In these cases the relocation of that offending industrial activity would be a reasonable way forward in mitigating the adverse amenity issues may be acceptable. Every case will treated on its own merits. 9.2.6 To demonstrate a lack of market demand an applicant should submit transparent and robust marketing evidence that the site has been vacant and that a thorough continuous marketing exercise has been undertaken and sustained in the local area for a 12 month period. Marketing must be through a commercial agent that sets out the competitive price that genuinely reflects the market value of the property in relation to its use, condition, quality and location. It must be demonstrated that consideration has been given to alternative layouts and business uses, including smaller premises with short term flexible leases appropriate for SMEs. 9.2.7 Some non-designated industrial land and floorspace is located within larger sites that include other uses such as retail. The Council recognises that in such cases redevelopment of the overall site may provide an important opportunity to secure a more advantageous distribution and allocation of land uses having regard to factors such as the characteristics of the site and its surroundings. In such cases, the Council will expect the wider redevelopment proposal to make suitable re-provision for the non-designated industrial land where the policy requires that it is retained. Any subsequent proposals for the loss of the non-designated land will be assessed against the policy requirements in order to ensure that there is no incremental loss of industrial land over the Plan Period. 9.3 Affordable workspace Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021 London Borough of Havering 65",

Havering’s entrepreneurial businesses play an essential role in the local economy. The Council is committed to supporting these organisations and recognises that affordable workspace is a means to do so. 9.3.2 Flexible workspaces are managed, commercial premises, particularly suitable for small/ start-up businesses and which are divided into a collection of small units help by occupiers on a short-term, easy-in, easy-out basis and with communally-shared services, facilities and support for the entrepreneurial activities of the occupiers. Affordable Workspace means flexible workspace which is let to a Workplace Provider and which will allow for occupation by the end users in one or more sectors on terms; Substantially below market levels of rents and charges when compared with an equivalent letting of the space and facilities on the open market; and at a rate comparable with similar facilities available in Havering or (if sufficient comparator premises do not exist in the borough)_across London as a whole; and at rates which mean that occupation is feasible to a large number of small/ start-up businesses in the relevant sector(s) 9.3.3 Havering has a high number of micro and small businesses, Havering's Employment Land Review (2015) reported that over 90% of businesses in the borough are micro companies with up to nine employees and a further 7% are small enterprises with between 10 and 49 employees. The ELR found that in the office sector the key gap in provision is in affordable and flexible serviced office accommodation to meet the needs of small start-up companies, there is also demand for smaller industrial unit space for start-up/young and growing businesses. Increasing provision of affordable workspace through contributions from the applicant, or in new premises can help ensure more small businesses have space to stay in the borough and expand. 9.3.4 Many small/start-up businesses, with the potential for financial self-sufficiency, have particular needs that often cannot be met by the market, either because affordable rents are unviable for the applicant, or it is below a standard expectation of return. This has been compounded by a significant loss of office floorspace in the borough over the last decade due to particular pressure on the conversion of offices to residential use. The introduction of permitted development rights, which allows office to residential conversion without explicit planning permission means that these losses have been further exacerbated – a trend which is expected to continue. In addition, pressure on providing housing targets in the borough requires the Council to de-designate industrial land, which puts additional pressure on the borough’s industrial employment land to provide smaller light industrial units that encourage small/start-ups businesses to provide ‘services to support the service sector’. 9.3.5 The Council intends to use affordable workspace as a key driver to support a flourishing local economy, and provision and preservation of affordable and suitable workspaces that can easily be sub-divided for different uses will increase the opportunities for small business which are essential to Havering’s economic vitality and a catalyst for regeneration. The Council will maintain a record of affordable workspace available to small businesses as part of its commitment to growing the Havering economy. 66 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

Cost 9.3.7 In this context, ‘affordable’ would be defined as rent and service charges (excluding business support services) that are either: less than 80% than comparable local market rates for a period of 5-years per occupant; or a sliding scale of 60% of local market rates from years 1 to 2; and 80% from years 3 to 5. The Council will also consider alternative suggestions made by developers 9.3.8 A sliding scale is preferred as it will allow a larger rent relief during the initial stages, which will reduce as a business matures and is likely to be able to pay higher rents. This will also enable a more seamless transition to a market level rent at the end of the lease. 9.3.9 What is defined as ‘local market rate’ will vary depending on the location and the type of workspace provided. Market rates can rise considerably in a short space of time.

To maximise flexibility the Council encourages developments that comprise a large area of floorspace to be managed as a series of smaller ‘units’. However, this creates complexity in determining whether a proposal meets policy requirements. Where the micro/small floorspace component is provided as a single floorplate, the applicant must demonstrate that the design of the development is orientated towards the operational needs of small businesses.

At the planning application stage an agreed Workspace Provider must be identified, along with a submitted proposal for assessment by the Council which details the agreement with the Workspace Provider for managing the workspace to an agreed specification; detailing the potential management arrangements and rents to be charged for a minimum of 5 years. 9.3.17 Applicants will be required to demonstrate likely lease terms for target sectors, and where appropriate make provision for short-term, flexible 'all-in' and 'meanwhile' leases, and where relevant letting space on a per-desk rather than per-square-foot basis. 9.3.18 The design of workspace for small and micro enterprises will vary, depending on the end occupier or sector. In general however, applicants should demonstrate that the workspace incorporates flexible internal arrangements, with good natural light, suitable subdivision and configuration for new uses and activities. The proposal should incorporate flexible design features to provide adaptability for a range of uses and occupants. Basic fit-out should be provided to a level beyond shell and core to include: super-fast broadband connections; shared space and facilities such as communal breakout space, kitchen areas, toilets, bike storage, etc; good standard of insulation to mitigate any overspill from future alternative uses in the building, grouping of services; plumbing, electrics, cabling, and communications infrastructure; light industrial or maker spaces have physical needs for greater floor-to-ceiling heights and service access to accommodate larger equipment and deliveries. On specific projects other issues may need to be considered, such as the co-ordination of fire alarm provision, access control arrangements, landscaping design, and mobile phone signal strength. 9.4 Skills and training 68 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

      "content": "9.4.1 Promoting employment, skills development and training opportunities for local people will contribute to sustainable economic development, the health, well being and quality of life of residents. The availability of the right skills in the borough will mean that there will be less need for people with these skills to travel into Havering, reducing both congestion on Havering’s transport networks (roads and public transport) and carbon emissions. 9.4.2 Havering has a high proportion of residents of working age and although employment rates are stable there are a lower proportion of Havering residents in high skilled jobs compared to other outer London boroughs. This is reflected in the average gross household income which is £44,430 compared to the London average of £51,770. This places Havering within the lowest third of all London boroughs [(8)] . It is important that the borough has a strong economy and that local people have the opportunity to benefit from new developments, particularly where these offer the scope for jobs, skills development and training opportunities. Although Havering has good schools, academic qualifications are low; 35% aged 16 and over have no qualifications in the most deprived areas and 35% have qualifications at Level 1 or 2 (Level 2 is equivalent to a GCSE grade A*-C). This could be attributed to the high numbers of residents leaving full-time education aged 16 or under (more than 50%) compared to the London average of 24% [(9)] 9.4.3 The Council is keen that Havering residents are able to enjoy the same opportunities as those in other parts of London and currently supports a number of initiatives, including Job Clubs, employability and training support through Havering Adult College, the Troubled Families programme and other externally funded projects. A pilot employment service is currently being funded through European Social Fund (ESF) provision to support those furthest from the labour market. Moving forward, future projections for the London job market are heavily skewed towards higher level qualifications and there is a need, therefore, to support Havering residents to access skills development and training opportunities that will enhance their skills levels and earning capacity. 9.4.4 Havering is well-placed to support a 20% local labour target, which is considered reasonable given its demographics. As well as an established base of construction businesses, the borough is also home to the Havering College Construction Campus which can support the training needs of local residents. 9.4.5 The Employment and Skills Plan (ESP), which will form part of section 106 agreements and will be monitored by the Council, should detail the following: Number of jobs created (temp/ perm/ full time, part time etc); Forecasting of jobs; How they expect to fulfil the 20% local labour target, including providing more personalised support and improved delivery, and ensuring more effective training and employment support for all; How they will work with the Council to achieve those obligations, including getting more local unemployed persons back into work; How they will maintain a labour and apprenticeship register, which must be available for inspection by the Council. 9.4.6 Applicants should use the Council's Employment and Skills Plan template to set out the information showing that it meets the London Borough of Havering's requirement to accord with its *Community* *Benefit* *Clauses* *in* *Procurement* *Guidelines* [(10)] *.* 9.4.7 For the purpose of Policy 22 ‘Local’ refers to the location of permanent operation of business or location of resident’s home being within the London Borough of Havering. 8 9 10 Havering JSNA 2016 p6 A research study into skills and employment in Havering – Renaisi 2014 p5 [https://intranet.havering.gov.uk/help-with-work/procurement-guidance/](https://intranet.havering.gov.uk/help-with-work/procurement-guidance/) Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021 London Borough of Havering 69",

Congestion, north-south connectivity and air pollution are some of the key issues affecting Havering’s transport [network.As](https://network.As) new development generates new trips, proposals are expected to be accompanied by a transport assessment or statement which sets out how adverse impacts will be avoided or mitigated. Travel Plans submitted through the planning application process will be reviewed and monitored to ensure that developers are meeting their targets for modal shift. The Council will engage with local business to encourage the use of travel planning to increase modal shift to/from work away for the private vehicle. 10.1.2 It is recognised that the scale of growth in the wider sub-region will have a cumulative impact on the road networks within the region. The Council is committed to working with its subregional partners to mitigate these impacts and is already engaging with key partners such as TfL, the GLA, Essex County Council and neighbouring boroughs including the establishment of an inter-borough group reviewing the A127 corridor. 10.1.3 Policy 23 addresses a wide range of transport issues and contains a number of priorities to make the borough more accessible for its residents and visitors. The Council supports projects that improve the frequency and capacity of public transport trips towards central London and will continue to lobby train operating companies for such improvements. It will continue to press for a significant improvement to Romford Station by working closely with the stakeholders who have a role in, or responsibility for, the station. The Council is also committed to optimising the transport connections to essential services across the borough for those who do not have access to a car. New development is expected to seize opportunities to contribute to the projects listed within policy, including by design. 10.1.4 Positive discussions are currently taking place with the GLA concerning securing Havering’s key strategic transport aspirations of remodelling of Gallows Corner, the Romford Ring Road and improving north south public transport connectivity. Havering sees these projects as key to the successful delivery of good growth within the borough. Havering is actively progressing this work and a feasibility study is currently being conducted looking at options for a new north south public transport link to support growth within the Strategic Development Areas. 10.1.5 Through Havering’s Local Implementation Plan Annual Spending Submission, the Council will continue to deliver initiatives that enable sustainable and active travel across the borough and help to meet its statutory targets and support the Mayor's Healthy Streets agenda. New funding opportunities will be sought to assist with delivering Havering's strategic transport intervention aspirations. 10.1.6 New developments will provide an opportunity for the Council to seek financial contributions that can improve public transport access and deliver highway improvements where necessary. 10.1.7 Where developments propose the adoption of highways by the Council, developers will be subject to the requirements of a separate 'section 38 agreement' (s38 of the Highways Act 1980). The Council is not required to adopt private roads but may agree to do so if the highway is built to an adoptable standard and a commuted sum towards its ongoing maintenance is secured. Where developers seek to carry out works on the public highway a section 278 agreement s278 of the Highways Act 1980) will be needed and supervision fees will be required to be paid. 10.1.8 The 2004 Traffic Management Act requires boroughs to *“secure* *the* *expeditious* *movement* *of* *traffic* *on* *the* *authorities’* *road* *network”.* The policies set out above will provide residents and visitors with alternative options to travelling by car and will help to meet this duty. 10.1.9 Promoting sustainable alternatives to the car can help to reduce congestion, reduce air pollution, and improve the health and wellbeing of Havering residents. There may be scope to provide longer routes for walkers and cyclists where these have the potential to connect to similar routes outside Havering. 10.1.10 Increasing accessibility to employment areas within Havering will reduce the need for residents to travel to work by private vehicle and increase the number of suitable job opportunities that are available for residents locally.

      "content": "Developments should seek to provide the minimum realistic amount of car parking for the scheme, without undue risk of overspill parking onto surrounding streets. The allocation of car parking should consider the needs of disabled people, both in terms of quantity and location. 10.2.2 Developments will be supported that comply with the London Plan parking standards for all other forms of parking including for cycles, motor-cycles, cars for disabled people, electric vehicle charging points and coaches; 10.2.3 The Council’s approach to off-street car parking standards is to ensure that parking is not over-provided at destinations served by good public transport (maximum levels of provision), but to recognise and respect the decision many residents make to continue to own a car and ensure that adequate levels of off-street parking are provided in new residential development in areas with lower levels of accessibility to public transport. The Council considers this is justified and appropriate in Havering because the borough is not well provided with public transport services for some journeys and there are no practical alternatives to making journeys by car. 10.2.4 The London Plan Parking Standards clearly outline the need for more sustainable travel. The parking standards for outer London boroughs allow for additional parking in comparison to central London boroughs. This is determined by the access to public transport, as identified by the TfL's Public Transport Accessibility Levels (PTAL) *.* 10.2.5 Table 11 sets out minimum parking standards for PTAL’s 0-1. Applying minimum standards to some specific parts of the borough that are PTAL 0-1 recognises that the London Plan provides outer London boroughs with the opportunity to apply a more flexible approach to parking standards in these areas. 10.2.6 Some areas of the borough (such as central Romford and Upminster) have good or very good access to public transport. In areas well served by public transport and therefore with high PTAL levels, the Council has an obligation under the London Plan to reduce private car use and provide fewer parking spaces in comparison to other parts of the borough. 10.2.7 Car clubs and pool car schemes are becoming increasingly popular as a means of reducing the need for people to own a car, particularly in areas of good public transport accessibility where there may only be occasional need to use a car. The Council will expect the inclusion of a publicly accessible car club scheme where the scale of development would support the provision of such a scheme. 10.2.8 The London Plan has also set out a requirement for electric vehicle charging point parking spaces to be included within a development. Therefore, developments will need to include the minimum required electric vehicle parking spaces as required at the time of the application. 10.2.9 The Council will expect parking provision to be provided on site, however it is recognised that this may not always be sufficient. In situations where in-curtilage parking is required, it should be located close to the home to avoid inconvenience and increase natural surveillance. Large, isolated car parks should be avoided. Whilst parking will be provided within private areas, it should be recognised that people will wish to park where they consider convenient and this is often on the existing or proposed street. This should be taken into consideration, and parking designed to be convenient for residents so that streets are not dominated by cars. 10.2.10 The design and layout of new residential development should take account of the needs of people wishing to cycle through the provision of safe, accessible and secure cycle parking. Developers should aim to make cycle storage as convenient as access to car parking to encourage cycling as a sustainable mode of transport. New flatted development should provide some space either inside the building in a cycle store-room or provide a separate, secure and accessible bike shed within the overall development. 10.2.11 To reinforce the need for sufficient off-street parking provision and to encourage occupiers to use the available on-site parking, restrictions to eligibility for on-street parking permits can apply to existing and any future parking restrictions. 10.2.12 The Council will use informatives and legal agreements to ensure that future occupants are aware they are not entitled to apply for on-street parking permits. 76 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

      "content": "10.3 Digital connections 10.3.1 The Council recognises the growing importance of the need for modern, effective communications systems to serve local residents and businesses and their crucial role in both the national and local economy. The aim is to improve connectivity whether this is through mobile, wireless or broadband infrastructure. 10.3.2 The benefits of enhanced digital connectivity are far reaching, with wider access to broadband not only encouraging local enterprise, but also paving the way for flexibility for residents to work from home, save on transport costs and reduce congestion. These are principles of sustainable economic growth and development that align well with the guiding principles of the NPPF (paragraph 42). Benefits of wider broadband access are also conveyed to local authorities, with enhanced communications networks providing opportunity to improve health, education and public service provision across the borough. 10.3.3 As technology continues to advance and new ways to better deliver communications infrastructure constantly sought, it is important that developers take the necessary steps to 'future proof' their developments, incorporating into design the latest construction methods and in-built physical infrastructure necessary to enable the delivery of high-speed broadband services. This includes the installation of direct fibre optic cable access and the provision of ducting from the buildings access point to the public highway. 10.3.4 In regards telecommunications infrastructure, the Government has issued Permitted Development rights to a variety of minor forms of telecommunications development. Part 24 of the General Permitted Development Order (1995) (as amended) “Development by Telecommunications Code System Operators” allows telecommunications operators to install and replace certain types of telecommunications equipment, provided certain criteria are met without the need for planning permission. Although the Council cannot object to the principle of development, in some instances, it can exercise control over the siting and appearance of telecommunications equipment in the interests of protecting amenity. Therefore, Policy 25 seeks to ensure the appropriate balance between providing essential telecommunications infrastructure and protecting the environment and local amenity is struck, particularly in areas of nature conservation, open space, and historic townscape that are more likely to be sensitive to the installation of new masts and structures than other land uses.

The policy is detailed in order to support the delivery of high quality design in the borough. The Council consider that high quality design and the on-going maintenance and management of development is critical to the delivery of successful places and cohesive communities where people choose to live and settle. Where appropriate, national, regional and local level design guidance and best practice standards should be applied in the design of all development. To this end, the Council will support a culture of continued improvement in quality, design and performance of new development. It will keep under review the need for specific planning policy guidance documents to be prepared to promote and secure its commitment to high quality places. 11.1.2 New development provides the opportunity to enhance the character of an area to create a positive sense of place by reinforcing, repairing and adding to the positive aspects of the built environment. It should seek to optimise the distinctive character of the existing buildings, landscape and topography, and incorporate the principles of ‘Secured by Design’. Respecting local character does not necessarily mean replicating it. However, great care should be taken when incorporating contemporary design into the existing urban fabric. New and old buildings can coexist without negatively influencing the character of the area. 11.1.3 The design of large strategic schemes must adopt a rigorous design and impact approach involving detailed local area analysis of the site characteristics and the fabric of the surrounding environment and views. Account must also be taken of the adequacy of on-going management and maintenance arrangement. Given that large strategic schemes can be transformative, the Council wants to ensure that they are particularly well designed and focused on optimising the benefits to Havering residents and businesses. The Council understands that big schemes are complex to design, and so wants to work with developers at all stages of the design process to ensure that their brief aligns with the polices of Local Plan.

By agreeing the development brief at an early stage (RIBA Stage 0) [(11)] the design process can get off to the best start and by working together through subsequent RIBA Stages, the Council's Planning and Regeneration services and the developers will have the best chance of producing a high quality schemes that existing and future generations will enjoy. 11.1.4 Urban Design London has published \"The Design Companion For Planning And Placemaking (2017)\". This guidance supplements the NPPF and PPG and developers are encouraged to use this to shape the design process and outcomes. 11.1.5 Some areas may be considered to have poor, mediocre or no distinctive character. In these instances, where it can be robustly evidenced, good planning and urban design may justify a development that departs from its context for particularly high quality innovative proposals. 11.1.6 Applicants will need to explain how the development proposal responds to the character of the site and wider area through a Design and Access Statement, as required by relevant Article 8 of the Development Management Procedure Order. General features to consider include distinctive building styles, established scale, massing, height, materials, layout, access, trees, landscape features, open spaces, landmarks, views and heritage assets at statutory and local level. 11.1.7 The access to and circulation through a development should integrate with and improve the existing movement patterns of the wider area, and wherever possible, also seek to repair fragmented urban form and the pattern of a block or locality. A network of well-connected streets should be provided that offers a choice of routes with easy access to local amenities, open space, the public transport network and established routes. 11.1.8 Streets should be designed as public spaces with the needs of all users considered. Well designed streets with safe, direct, convenient and clear pedestrian and cycle routes helps to maximise the transport choices of residents, and can influence people to use more active modes of travel. Residential layouts designed solely to meet the requirements of vehicular traffic are not acceptable. New routes and connections should provide integrated routes for pedestrians, cyclists and vehicular traffic. When designing new residential and mixed-use developments consideration should be given to how frequent deliveries will be accommodated. 11.1.9 Infill developments should pay particular attention to the way they link together the areas that surround the site to avoid creating isolated enclaves of development. However, the need for permeability should still maintain safety, security and privacy. Routes into and through a development should minimise areas where the private activities of residents are visible to the public, and all access points should be clearly visible and should contribute to mixed, sociable communities and avoid isolation. 11.1.10 Most of Havering’s streets are grid based, characterised by a framework of interconnected routes that define street blocks, as is typical of outer London suburban locations. In most cases, new developments should respond to the traditional street pattern that exists in the borough. Because the layout of housing within these blocks can range from terraces to detached homes, new developments should take account of the block size and structure of the area surrounding the site. 11.1.11 Active frontages, characterised by frequent doors and windows, help to avoid blank walls facing the public realm and provide natural surveillance. Primary access to dwellings should be from the street wherever possible, and direct rather than communal entrances are preferred to support active frontages and contribute to the legibility of an area. Where communal entrances are required (for example to stair and lift lobbies) the entrances should be prominent, generous and have secure access for residents. 11.1.12 Scale, massing and height refer to the arrangement, volume, shape and size of a building or a group of buildings in relation to other buildings and spaces; and their combined visual impact. It is these aspects of the built form which determine views, vistas and skylines. New development should reflect the existing building lines and rhythm of the street. Where uniform building heights form a distinctive character, major variations will not normally be appropriate. It is important to ensure that new buildings are well laid-out internally and do not lead to cramped layouts. 11 Royal Institute of British Architects Plan of Work: [www.ribaplanofwork.com](http://www.ribaplanofwork.com) 80 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

Use of durable and high quality materials is fundamental to creating robust and sustainable residential development. Materials should be chosen to withstand their environment and likely abuse with minimal maintenance. Poor quality materials that are hard to maintain will wear badly and will not be acceptable. 11.1.14 High quality contemporary materials can create an attractive and distinctive character, however, care should be taken to ensure that all materials respond to the site context and design objectives. Thought should be given to the sourcing, energy efficiency and life cycle of the materials chosen. Permeable paving should be used where possible for hard surfacing. 11.1.15 Ensuring inclusive access in development proposals will enable everyone, regardless of disability, gender or age, to access the development. In Havering, it is particularly important that careful consideration is given to the developing an environment suitable for an ageing population. Accessibility is a significant issue because of the high proportion of older people in the borough, the relatively high number of households containing someone with physical disability, and the forecast increase in the numbers of very young and very old. 11.1.16 The National Planning Policy Framework states that Local Planning Authorities should have local design review arrangements in place to provide assessment and support to ensure high standards of design. The Council had established a Design Review Panel comprised of independent specialists and Council representatives and will expect development proposals of a strategic nature to be subject to review. For the purpose of this policy development proposals of a strategic nature are those that have potential to significantly impact or alter the character of an area including those that comprise of tall buildings and those referable to the Mayor. If an applicant is in doubt about whether a design review is required this should be discussed with the councils planning department at pre-application stage. 11.2 Landscaping 11.2.1 Landscape refers to the character, design and appearance of all of the spaces between buildings. High quality landscapes can contribute positively to the streetscape and local character of an area, promote a sense of place, provide visual amenity, enhance security and safety, enhance the sustainability of the development, support natural habits and biodiversity an provide opportunities for recreation and relaxation. To ensure that new development both integrates with and enhances its surroundings, it is essential that the design and continued maintenance of the spaces around buildings is given equal consideration to the design of the buildings themselves.

The level of detail provided as part of the planning application should be commensurate with the size, type and location of the new development and its impact on the local area. 11.2.3 Landscape design should be integrated with the building design from the earliest stage. The scale of the landscape elements within the scheme should be appropriate to the development as a whole. Landscape elements should be appropriate to the space actually available, and elements should not be forced into areas where they do not fit or are overly crowded. Equally, it is important that landscaped areas are of adequate size and scale to become established as well as allowing space for necessary maintenance to take place. 11.2.4 Landscape schemes should contribute to sense of place and local distinctiveness. Opportunities to enhance the landscape character or appearance of an area through, for example, planting locally native species, harnessing the topographical character of the site and retaining existing landscape features and trees are encouraged. 11.2.5 Areas of the borough with an undistinguished or poorly defined landscape character provide the opportunity to bring forward landscape schemes with their own distinct character which improve the amenity and appearance of the wider area through, for example, the planting of ornamental trees and shrubs and use of high quality contemporary hard landscaping. 11.2.6 It is important to clearly define the boundary between public, private and communal spaces in order to provide clear ownership and responsibility for all open areas around new development and increase privacy and security. Landscaping features should avoid screening areas that would otherwise benefit from natural surveillance. Boundary treatments are particularly important for the integration of new development into the local area, and should be sympathetic to the local landscape character and street scene. Front boundaries should reinforce the prevailing character of the streetscape, especially where a continuous uniform treatment forms a distinctive character. Boundary design should also complement the design materials and techniques used in the overall scheme. 11.2.7 Landscaping schemes should demonstrate a commitment to promoting biodiversity, having regard to Havering's Nature Conservation and Biodiversity Strategy (2014). Wherever possible, the opportunity to create new areas of wildlife habitat should be taken. Biodiversity can be incorporated into development through wildlife-friendly landscapes, careful choice of plant and tree species, installation of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), and features such as green walls, balconies and roofs, and nesting and roosting spaces. Such measures also contribute to the protection and promotion of habitat links with adjacent areas to extend wildlife corridors as defined in Policy 30. 11.2.8 In situations where development is planned to take place in an area where there are existing trees, particularly where the trees are identified as subject to a Tree Preservation Order (TPO), a site survey and arboricultural method statement will need to be conducted to ensure no harm comes to the roots or crown of the tree during construction. Guidance can be found in the British Standard document BS 5837:2012 (Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction. Recommendations) and any future replacement for this standard, on the minimum requirements which need to be adhered to. 11.2.9 A comprehensive management plan will be sought for all major applications including residential, commercial, industrial and mixed use development. The Management Plan should set out the on-going maintenance tasks, the long-term goals of the landscape scheme and how these will be achieved, typically covering the establishment (e.g. first 5 years), maturation (e.g. years 6 to 15) and long-term mature (e.g. year 16 onwards) periods. 11.2.10 The Council may attach conditions to the planning application or enter into a Section 106 agreement with the developer/landowner to ensure the long-term management and maintenance of the landscaping on the site. Generally, the approved landscape scheme will be required to be maintained for a minimum of five years with replacement of any plants/trees which fail to survive. 82 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

It makes a significant contribution to the local economy and has a positive impact on the borough's communities, the well-being of individuals and their quality of life. The Council is committed to identifying, conserving and enhancing the significance of the borough's historic environment, and to seeking opportunities for people to access, enjoy and learn from its heritage assets, through sustainable development. 11.3.2 The Local Plan identifies a number of key growth areas in the borough which provide diverse development opportunities that can capitalise on Havering's unique historic environment. High quality design and heritage-led development that responds to the character and appearance of the historic environment in these and other areas of the borough, and which positively contributes to local character and distinctiveness, will be encouraged in order to help sustain the distinctive character and vitality of the borough's town centres and neighbourhoods. 11.3.3 The borough contains a wealth of designated heritage assets, including 140 listed buildings, 3 Scheduled Monuments, and 11 Conservation Areas that are afforded statutory protection, and Upminster Court Gardens, which is on Historic England's Register of Parks and Gardens of Historic Interest in England. The Council will contribute to the maintenance of a ‘heritage at risk register’ with a view to raising the profile of those designated heritage assets that are at risk in order to help secure development proposals that will conserve and enhance their significance, and secure an appropriate viable use. All development proposals affecting designated heritage assets will be dealt with in accordance with the relevant legislation and the NPPF.

For example, the special interests and significance of the Gidea Park Conservation Area, with its individually architect designed 'Arts and Crafts' style Competition and Exhibition houses, are very different to that of Romford Conservation Area, which are based on its historic significance rather than a defined architectural character. Havering's Conservation Areas all have Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Proposals which identify the special interest of each area. There are certain parts of the borough which, whilst not conservation areas, have special and unique characters which add to the landscape and landscape quality of Havering. Developments in these areas should aim to preserve the spacious character of the Emerson Park and Hall Lane and Upminster residential areas to maintain the special character of these areas. Due to criteria dealing with applications in the Emerson Park and Hall Lane Special Policy Areas are contained in separate SPD’s. 11.3.6 Proposals for new and replacement buildings and features within a Conservation Area or its setting, will be expected to be of a high quality design. For this reason, the Council will not normally accept applications for outline planning permission within Conservation Areas or their setting, and demolition will only be considered where the building, or other element, fails to make a positive contribution to the character or appearance, and significance of the Conservation Area. 11.3.7 Where the exercise of permitted development rights would erode the character or appearance of a Conservation Area, or other heritage asset, the council will seek to sustain their significance, including the contribution to significance provided by their setting, through the use of Article 4 directions. 11.3.8 In order to manage development in a way that conserves and enhances the borough's historic areas, the Council will undertake its duty to review the identification and designation of Conservation Areas against its agreed criteria for special architectural or historic interest. It will support the maintenance of the borough's Conservation Areas through the preparation of up to date appraisals and management plans. The Romford Conservation Area Appraisal is the first to be reviewed due to its 'at risk' status and its location within a Strategic Development Area, and this process is underway. The forthcoming review of the Gidea Park Conservation Area Appraisal will include a review and appraisal of the area previously designated as the Gidea Park Special Character Area within the 2008 Local Development Framework. 11.3.9 Not all of Havering's heritage assets are designated. There are also many non-designated heritage assets that contribute to the character and distinctiveness of the borough's historic environment including historic parks and gardens of local interest and locally important historic buildings. In order to ensure that these elements of the historic environment are conserved in a manner appropriate to their significance, the Council will work with local communities to promote the identification and maintenance of a list of non-designated heritage assets when these meet its agreed criteria. The proposed Local List criteria will be subject to public consultation. Development proposals affecting non-designated heritage assets will be dealt with in accordance with the NPPF. 11.3.10 To enable the Council to determine a the potential impact of a development proposal on the historic environment, it will require applications affecting a heritage asset, or its setting, to be accompanied by either a Design & Access Statement that includes both an assessment of the assets significance and impact statement, or a separate Heritage Statement. Proposals that affect a site which includes, or has the potential to include, heritage assets with archaeological interest, will need to be accompanied by an archaeological desk-based assessment, and may also require field evaluation in order to determine its significance. 11.3.11 All proposals affecting heritage assets should be informed by consultation with the Historic Environment Record and assessed using appropriate expertise. The level of assessment needed should be proportionate to the significance of the asset affected and the impact of the proposal.

[(12)] 12.1.2 Havering has an extensive green infrastructure network comprising of many natural and semi-natural spaces, parks and gardens, woodland, rivers and their corridors. Policy 29 seeks to maintain and enhance Havering's position as one of London's greenest boroughs and ensure that development proposals are realising opportunities to integrate green infrastructure on site. Green infrastructure may include public rights of way in the form of bridleways and footpaths. These provide an opportunity for informal recreation such as horse-riding and walking and may provide scope for longer routes where they link up with similar features in adjoining areas. 12.1.3 Many developments have the potential to incorporate elements of green infrastructure. Examples of green infrastructure include green walls and roofs, water sensitive urban design and Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), new planting and landscaping, enhancement of river corridors. Policy 29 therefore links with other policies in the Local Plan which set out requirements on the integration of types of green infrastructure into developments including policies on residential design and amenity, Open space, sports and recreation, Nature conservation, Landscaping, Rivers and river corridors, Heritage assets and Air quality (Policies 7, 18, 30, 27, 31, 28 and 33 respectively). 12.1.4 The London-wide framework to deliver green infrastructure is the All London Green Grid which is embedded in the London Plan and its supplementary guidance, of which the 'Thames Chase, Beam & Ingrebourne Area Framework' is specifically applicable to Havering. The key objectives and priorities for the Thames Chase Community Forest are outlined in the Thames Chase Plan (2014). The objective of the Rainham Wildspace is to deliver the London Riverside Conservation Park, as set out in London Riverside Conservation Park: WildSpace for a World City (2005).

Many research studies have highlighted the importance of nature and access to the natural environment on people's health, wellbeing and development. 12.2.2 Havering's historic parks, river valleys and Thames-side marshland hold a significant proportion of London’s entire resource of a number of priority habitats including hedgerows, wet woodland, lowland mixed deciduous woodland, lowland meadows, coastal and floodplain grazing marsh, lowland fens, reedbeds, rivers and ponds. These habitats are also important for a number of protected and priority animal and plant species. The Havering Nature Conservation and Biodiversity Strategy (2014) sets out how the Council and its partners will promote, protect and enhance biodiversity in the borough. 12.2.3 The Council is committed to the protection of the most important areas of semi-natural habitat. Within Havering there are three Sites of Specific Scientific Interest (SSSIs), seven Local Nature Reserves (LNRs) and 89 Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation. These sites are identified on the Policies Map and in Annex 7. 12.2.4 SSSIs are the principal designation of sites and habitats of high national nature conservation importance. The Inner Thames Marshes SSSI forms the largest remaining expanse of wetland bordering the upper reaches of the Thames and supports large numbers of overwintering and breeding wetland birds, rare plant and invertebrate species, and diverse marine wildlife. The Ingrebourne Valley SSSI supports the largest. and most diverse coherent areas of freshwater marshland in Greater London and includes extensive areas of reed-sweet grass. Hornchurch Cutting is a geological SSSI with glacial deposits containing Jurassic-age rocks and fossils. 12.2.5 The function of LNRs is principally to preserve features and areas of special interest and to provide opportunities for the study and enjoyment of their natural interest. Local Authorities have the power to acquire, declare and manage land as LNRs. The Council also has a duty to further the conservation and enhancement of such sites.

These are based on a hierarchy from sites of metropolitan importance to sites of borough and local importance. In line with the London Plan, sites of metropolitan importance will be given the strongest protection, with sites of borough and local importance given the level of protection commensurate with their importance. The SINCs in the borough have been reviewed (Havering SINC Review 2017) following close working with Havering Wildlife Project and the London Wildlife Sites Board, which has lead to one site being promoted to metropolitan importance as well as extended and newly designated sites of borough importance. In addition, the recommendations of the GLA SMI SINC review (2016) have been taken on board resulting of the promotion of a site to metropolitan importance. 12.2.7 Wildlife corridors are linear features which connect significant areas of wildlife habitat and, in so doing, moderate some of the adverse ecological effects of habitat fragmentation. Havering has a concentration of sites of high biodiversity value across the northern ridge and, in the south of the borough, the high-value Ingrebourne and Inner Thames Marshes SSSIs and the corridor of the River Thames. Wildlife corridors should have a minimum continuous band of natural vegetation of 10 m by 30 m wide.

Appropriate mitigation and/or compensation measures will also need to be identified where necessary. The Council will offer early advice and will require protected species surveys to be carried out where occurrence of protected species is either confirmed or likely, including derelict or vacant land and buildings. 12.2.10 In addition to legally protected species such as bats, great crested newts, badgers, reptiles and water voles, Havering has important populations of other species listed in National, London or Havering Biodiversity Action Plans (BAP). Development is expected to identify appropriate measures to extend favourable conditions for protected species on land and in buildings, e.g. through landscaping or by providing bird or bat boxes. Policy 27 sets out how this can be achieved.

Policy 31 should be read alongside the 'Blue Ribbon Network' policies in the London Plan, which relate to London's strategic network of waterspaces. Further requirements for development regarding flood risk management are contained in Policy 32. 12.3.2 All the rivers in Havering (Beam, Ravensbourne, Rom, Mardyke, Ingrebourne and Southall Sewer and Runningwater Brook) are currently at ‘moderate’ status under the Water Framework Directive and will need to achieve 'good' ecological status or potential by 2027. There are a wide range of measures that have been identified to improve the waterbodies such as re-naturalisation, de-culverting, re-connecting rivers to their floodplains, in-channel enhancements, creating wetlands and reedbeds, tackling domestic plumbing misconnections, improving fish passage with the removal or notching of weirs and eradicating and managing non-native species. For the implementation of this policy, any development within 20 m of the main river is considered in close proximity. 12.3.3 The Thames River Basin Management Plan 2015 – 2021 [(14)] sets out measures to improve water quality and the ecological status of water bodies in the borough and the wider catchment.

The Council is engaging with the Environment Agency to explore possible measures. Policy 1 sets out the requirement for developers to facilitate and contribute towards these enhancements. 12.3.5 For development in river corridors and areas affected by tidal flood risk developers should work in partnership with the Environment Agency and the Council to obtain advice on necessary improvement measures, integrating improvements to flood defences in the design of development and creating an attractive riverside. There is potential to improve the riverside both when defences are raised and when they are repaired or replaced. Only when it can be demonstrated that on-site improvements are not feasible, will a financial contribution for off-site provision be considered. 12.3.6 Developments that cause further deterioration of the watercourse or prevent future improvement measures from taking place will not be permitted. In certain circumstances, it may be necessary for the developer to undertake a Water Framework Directive assessment particularly if there are direct works to a river. 12.3.7 Policy 31 sets out the minimum requirements for development to be set back from the top bank of rivers. An appropriate buffer is required to maintain and improve access to existing flood defences, safeguard land for future flood defence raising and landscape, amenity and habitat improvements. A different appropriate distance may be agreed by the Council or the Environment Agency to achieve biodiversity, amenity or flood management objectives. 12.3.8 The London Plan requires Thames-side boroughs to define a Thames Policy Area (TPA), to highlight the strategic importance of the River Thames. The boundaries of the TPA in Havering have been identified in consultation with neighbouring boroughs. Development within the TPA provides the opportunity to enhance and expand the existing pedestrian and cycle path that stretches along the Thames. 12.3.9 The Thames Estuary 2100 (TE2100) Plan sets out the Environment Agency's recommendations for flood risk management for London and the Thames estuary and includes a range of short, medium and long-term actions. New land will be required for new defences, enlarged defences, new barriers, new areas of habitat creation, and in some cases flood storage. Developments in the Thames area are expected to have regard to these actions and recommendations to assure they remain possible, and where possible contribute to their delivery. 12.3.10 Halfway Wharf (formerly Tilda Rice) and Phoenix Wharf are both subject to existing safeguards. In line with London Plan policy on increasing the use of the Blue Ribbon Network for freight transport, the increased use of the borough's wharves will be encouraged. 12.3.11 As a tidal river, the Thames is part of the South East Inshore Marine Plan area. The Marine Plan for this area is currently being prepared by the Marine Management Organisation.

In addition to the areas of the borough at risk of flooding from rivers, other areas may also be at risk from flooding from groundwater, surface water runoff, ordinary watercourses and/or culvert blockage. The Havering Local Flood Risk Management Strategy provides information on all types of flooding in the borough and explains the powers and responsibilities regarding flood risk. 12.4.2 The requirements for the Sequential and Exception Tests are set out in the NPPF. The aim of the Sequential Test is to steer development to areas with the lowest probability of flooding. If development cannot be located in zones with lower probability of flooding development will need to apply the Exception Test, demonstrating that wider sustainability benefits outweigh the flood risk and including a site-specific flood risk assessment. 12.4.3 Policy 32 has been informed by the recommendations of the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (2016) (SFRA), which should be used by developers as a starting point regarding flood risk guidance. The SFRA identifies the areas at risk of flooding in the borough and sets out when developers need to submit site-specific flood risk assessments. 12.4.4 Apart from the requirements in the NPPF and London Plan, site-specific flood risk assessments will also be required where drainage problems are identified by the Council. This specifically includes development in the Havering Critical Drainange Areas (HCDAs) as identified in the SFRA. Site-specific flood risk assessments are particularly important as these HCDAs have known localised flooding problems which can cause significant damage. No Critical Drainange Areas have been identified in Havering by the Environment Agency. Site-specific flood risk assessments will also be required on other sites with potential flooding issues known by the Council. Early engagement with the Council as the Lead Local Flood Authority is therefore recommended. 12.4.5 The Washlands is a Flood Storage Area (FSA) for the River Beam. Due to the significant amount of development being proposed in, and nearby, the Washlands FSA as part of the Rainham and Beam Park Strategic Development Area, developments within the FSA will need to submit a site-specific flood risk assessments. This should specifically demonstrate resilience measures, safe access and egress or places of refuge as well as the potential of increasing flood risk elsewhere. 12.4.6 Developers should utilise the Government's Site-Specific Flood Risk Assessment Checklist in preparing site-specific flood risk assessments. The Council will consider the information in the Government's Flood Risk Assessments Checklist [(15)], the PPG and the SFRA in evaluating planning applications and accompanying site-specific flood risk assessments. 12.4.7 Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) should be designed appropriately for the local site characteristics.

Developers are also expected to include proposals for future maintenance and operation, including continued realisation of any non-drainage related benefits. 12.4.9 In some cases, the discharge or infiltration of surface water may require a permit under the Environmental Permitting Regulations developers are therefore advised to review available guidance [(16)] and seek advice from the Environment Agency at an early stage. 12.4.10 The council recognises that flood management measures can support biodiversity, and therefore contribute to the objectives of Policy 30. Developers are expected to seek to integrate such measures into the wide green infrastructure network in line with Policy 29. 16 [https://www.gov.uk/topic/environmental-management/environmental-permits](https://www.gov.uk/topic/environmental-management/environmental-permits) Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021 London Borough of Havering 93",

Although these levels are not breached in all areas of the borough it is acknowledged that activities which cause air pollution affect the wider area. The health effects of air pollution are serious and long-term exposure can affect lung function, breathing and asthma. 12.5.2 The Council is committed to improving air quality in the borough to improve the health and wellbeing of Havering's residents and is preparing an Air Quality Action Plan setting out how air quality in the borough can be improved and health benefits can be maximised. This includes the encouraging choices which include of sustainable and active travel, the use of green infrastructure and renewable energy. The Havering Council Air Quality Action Plan 2018- 2023 is being implemented. 12.5.3 In line with London Plan policy, development will be expected to be air quality neutral. The minimum benchmarks in the GLA's Sustainable Design & Construction SPG will need to be complied with. Where there is a risk of any negative air quality impacts associated with development proposals, an assessment and, if appropriate, mitigation measures will be required, to ensure that air quality has been adequately considered and any negative impacts are minimised. Developers are encouraged to contact the Council at an early stage in the design process to ensure information regarding the site correct. 12.6 Managing pollution 12.6.1 The health and safety of residents and visitors to the borough can be affected by pollution of the air, water and land as well as light and noise pollution. The Council seeks to minimise the exposure to pollutants both during construction and over the lifetime of the development to ensure the creation of safe and healthy places to live, visit and work in the borough.

Additional guidance to minimise adverse impacts during construction are set out in the Mayor's 'The control of dust and emissions during construction and demolition' SPG. 12.6.3 A different degree of exposure to pollutants may be acceptable for different types of land uses. In considering development proposals and accompanying detailed assessments, both the individual and cumulative adverse impacts of development will be taken into account. Development should also ensure that human health and the environment is protected during the cleaning up of any pollution or land contamination. 12.6.4 External lighting is often required to provide healthy and safe environments, to enhance the appearance of buildings and to extend the use of facilities, such as outdoor sports facilities. However, inappropriate lighting can negatively affect residents' quality of life, significantly change the character of the locality, adversely affect wildlife and use unnecessary amounts of energy. Care should be taken to ensure lighting only illuminates intended areas and does not affect or impact on its surroundings. The Institute of Lighting Engineers Guidance Note [(17)] provides additional guidance on the design of light installations. Applicants are also encouraged to consider guidance from the Bat Conservation Trust to minimise the impact of artificial lighting on wildlife [(18)] . 12.6.5 Where there is a potential for land contamination, a staged process of risk assessment will be required to demonstrate that land contamination has been effectively considered and addressed and that the land is suitable for its intended use, in accordance with the Council's Contaminated Land Inspection Strategy. The Environment Agency should be consulted when the proposed development poses a potential risk to controlled waters due to land contamination having regard to the Environment Agency's groundwater protection principles [(19)] . Regard should be given to the Surface Protection Zone along the border with Barking and Dagenham, which needs to be protected during development around discharges or pathways to groundwater.

The Joint Waste Plan sets out a planning strategy to 2021 for sustainable waste management and has regard to the London Plan's Borough level apportionment of household, commercial and industrial waste, as well as construction excavation and demolition waste. The Joint Waste DPD forms part of Havering's Development Plan alongside the Local Plan. Policy 35 therefore does not seek to deal with the wider issues of strategic waste management and focuses on waste, re-use and recycling facilities within developments. 12.7.3 In order to facilitate the sustainable management of waste in the future it is essential that all developments provide adequate facilities for the separation of waste and recyclables and for its satisfactory storage prior to collection. The Council's Waste Management Planning Practice Guidance for Architects and Developers sets out the minimum requirements for the storage and collection of waste and recyclable materials. Consideration should be given to the need for separate communal storage facilities for the re-use and recycling of bulky items. For developments including flatted properties, it will be expected that the required waste management plan adheres with the advice and (20) template provided by the London Waste and Recycling Board . The Council will bring forward detailed guidance in due course. 12.7.4 To help residents to actively move towards a culture of re-use and recycling wherever possible, development proposals should provide space (typically in the kitchen area of each property) for residents to be able to separate out waste. 12.7.5 All major mixed use, residential, commercial, and industrial development proposals must provide a waste management plan which clearly identifies the type and volume of waste expected, and size location and design of the waste and recycling storage. 12.7.6 The provision of adequate storage facilities on site is essential but they can be unsightly and can have adverse impacts on the appearance and quality of development proposals. The location and design of waste facilities should be considered at the earliest stage and as an integral part of the design process to ensure any impacts are minimised and mitigated. 12.7.7 Consideration should be given to the provision of on-site waste management in order to facilitate the re-use and recycling of waste generated by the development. On-site waste management can have the added benefit of reducing transport trips. 12.8 Low carbon design, decentralised energy and renewable energy 20 [http://www.lwarb.gov.uk/what-we-do/resource-london/successes-to-date/efficiencies-programme-outputs/](http://www.lwarb.gov.uk/what-we-do/resource-london/successes-to-date/efficiencies-programme-outputs/) Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021 London Borough of Havering 97",

Specific requirements relating to minimising carbon dioxide emissions, sustainable design and construction and decentralised energy are set out within the London Plan and will be applied by the Council. 12.8.2 The Rainham and Beam Park Strategic Development Area has been identified as a potential opportunity for the deployment of a district heating network. Therefore, development proposals should seek to connect to existing or planned decentralised energy networks for the area. 12.8.3 If it is not possible to link to an existing decentralised energy system, the feasibility of combined heat and power (CHP) needs to be considered on a site-wide basis connecting different uses and/or group of buildings or an individual building. Investment in heat and cooling distribution infrastructure should be considered in all developments. CHP systems must be designed to run efficiently and be optimally sized to maximise carbon dioxide savings. 12.8.4 In line with Government requirements set out in Written Ministerial Statement (HCWS42), a Local Plan Wind Resource technical feasibility study (2016) has been prepared. This has identified a number of potentially suitable locations for wind turbines in the borough subject to proposals satisfying planning policy requirements. These have been reflected in the Areas Suitable for Wind Energy Development designated on the Policies Map. The Wind Resource Study identifies potential for wind turbines in the north of the borough within parts of Dagnam Park and Bedfords Park. These are Council owned parks. The Council does not intend to bring forward or support proposals for wind turbines at Dagnam Park and Bedfords Park or at any of its other parks. 12.8.5 The Study identifies what areas are potentially suitable for large, medium or small turbines. Smaller turbines would not normally be allowed on sites suitable for larger wind turbines as this could reduce the potential for wind energy production. 12.8.6 To demonstrate compliance with the Written Statement (HCWS42) dated (18 June 2015) all proposals for wind turbines should be accompanied by a consultation statement, which sets out how the proposal has been subject to meaningful pre-application consultation with the affected local community. 98 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

There are relatively small resources of workable land-won sand and gravel in London however resource is known to exist in Havering, Redbridge, Hillingdon and Hounslow. The Council will seek to maintain an appropriate landbank as per the apportionment for the borough set out in the London Plan. 13.1.2 Datasets obtained from the British Geological Survey (BGS) show that the highest quality mineral reserves are located in the south of the borough. The data also revealed the potential for existence of minerals (superficial streams of clay, silt, sand and gravel) in the north-east of the borough. Given the requirements placed upon the borough by the London Plan for a sand and gravel landbank apportionment, these areas will continue to be safeguarded. 13.1.3 The Council seeks to ensure that the known reserve within Havering is not adversely impacted or unduly sterilised by non-mineral bearing development. Applications for non-mineral development coming forward in identified Mineral Safeguarding Areas will be considered on their individual merits with an assessment of need being made in context of the current landbank position and the benefits the development would result in from an economic, social or environmental perspective. 13.2 Mineral extraction 100 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

Accordingly, mineral extraction can give rise to a number of environmental and amenity impacts. The extraction process itself, for example, can result in changes to geological, hydrological, ecological, archaeological and landscape conditions and the action working/ operations further more can give rise to transport related, health and amenity (noise, air quality and vibration) and visual impacts. The Council, with any application for mineral development, will seek to to ensure full assessment of any potential impact both in the short and long term. Mitigation measures will be expected to be proposed and/ or contributions achieved through appropriate legal agreements to ensure impacts are managed throughout the life of the development. In this regard, the Council are particularly aware of the road infrastructure in the more rural areas of the borough and will closely engage with the Highway Authority to ensure any impact from HGV movements is appropriately addressed. 13.2.3 The Mineral Safeguarding Areas includes areas within close proximity to a number of residential areas and sensitive uses, and whilst being mindful of the need to plan for mineral extraction, the Council is also keen to ensure local communities are not adversely impacted by such development coming forward. The Council is also aware of the potential for cumulative impacts from multiple sites within close proximity of each other, because whilst minerals can only be worked where they are naturally found this can put significant pressure on particular communities and infrastructure. 13.2.4 The Council will seek to ensure that there are no significant adverse impacts arising from proposed mineral development to public health and safety, amenity, quality of life or nearby communities and/ or the environment.

The Council will provide information to the Greater London Authority to assist in the production of the annual London-wide Local Aggregate Assessment. This process, which required the Council to gather data from all active sites in the borough will provide an accurate picture of the landbank, allow particular trends within the industry to be identified and enable informed decisions to be made about the need for new sites/ developments going forward. The Council will resist extraction activities where a sufficient landbank exists unless there are specific circumstances that justify the development. Such proposals will be assessed on a case by case basis. 13.3 Secondary aggregates 13.3.1 The London Plan sets targets for levels of recycling and reuse of construction, excavation and demolition waste.

Working with partners 14.0.2 The Council recognises that much of the development identified in the Local Plan, particularly the investment in new homes and jobs, will be delivered by the private sector. Additionally, Government agencies and bodies such as the Department of Transport, Highways England, TfL, the GLA, Crossrail, Network Rail, and Train operating companies will have a key role to play in delivering the transport improvements which will be necessary for the full delivery of the spatial strategy. 14.0.3 The Council recognises that effective partnership working will be crucial to the successful implementation of the Havering Local Plan. The Council is committed to encouraging dialogue between developers and service providers including those provided by the Council itself to ensure effective delivery of the growth and development set out in its Local Plan. The Council taking the lead 14.0.4 The Council is committed to working collaboratively and constructively, and from the outset, with landowners, developers, investors, infrastructure providers, adjoining boroughs, the Mayor of London and other key stakeholders in the private, voluntary and community sectors across the borough to deliver the growth and development that is set out in this Local Plan. The Council will continue to work with all its partners and use all its relevant powers and programmes to ensure that, as far as possible, conditions exist to deliver the strategy in the Havering Local Plan. 14.0.5 The Council knows that its role and that of other public bodies as land owners is important through direct investment in the provision of land for new homes and infrastructure. To this end, the Council has established its own housing company and an ambitious estates regeneration programme, and has entered into three joint venture partnerships. The Council is also working proactively with other public sector bodies and private developers to bring forward sites in public and private ownership to increase the supply of housing in the borough. 14.0.6 As a land owner, the Council will promote and encourage specific development on its land as this will assist in addressing its priorities as well as in securing investor confidence. In appropriate circumstances, the Council may seek to enter into partnership agreement with private investors to encourage specific uses on land in Council ownership or on land adjacent to Council’s land. 14.0.7 The Council’s preferred approach towards land assembly will be through proactive and positive negotiation. Where necessary, appropriate and justified the Council may facilitate development by exercising its Compulsory Purchase Powers to acquire and assembly land in the public interest. 14.0.8 Havering has established a private sector focussed Housing Company, Mercury Land Holdings, to bring forward residential homes for market rent and sale. Also Havering’s Housing Department is ready to meet the challenge by investing in new Council Housing. Bridge Close, Angel Way, and Waterloo Road estate are the three sites where Havering are seeking HZ financial intervention as the market on its own would be unable to deal with a number of the complex issues to bring these sites forward. 14.0.9 As necessary, the Council will prepare appropriate strategies and guidance to set out measures and initiatives involved in the delivery of the Local Plan’s programmes and projects. The Infrastructure Delivery Plan 14.0.10 Ensuring that physical, social and community infrastructure needed for development is in place at the optimum time is essential to support the delivery of the vision, objectives and policies of the Local Plan. It is essential that the necessary community and transport infrastructure needed to support local communities and make development work is provided, particularly in those parts of the borough that will experience the most growth in the Plan Period.

The Council will encourage service providers to take this into account in the preparation of their own strategies and business plans. The IDP has also informed the preparation of the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy. 14.0.13 The Council will monitor the Infrastructure Delivery Plan and revise it where necessary so that it remains a good fit with the infrastructure requirements and provision in Havering. Delivering new homes and communities through Havering’s Housing Zones 14.0.14 The building of a significant number of new homes in the Strategic Development Areas of Romford and Rainham and Beam Park is identified in the Local Plan and will be supported by means of a range of planning and financial measures through the Mayor of London’s Housing Zone Programme. 14.0.15 Havering is one of only a few London boroughs with two Housing Zones and the Council considers that this will be an important element in its ability to deliver the new homes that the borough needs over the plan period because it provides a high degree of certainty that the new homes will come forward. This is a key component of the Local Plan’s approach to housing delivery. 14.0.16 The Rainham and Beam Park Housing Zone was established in 2015 followed by the Romford Housing Zone in 2016. The Housing Zone Programmes are funded by a combination of local authority funding, GLA direct and recoverable grant, and external funding. Housing Zone finance will be used predominantly to deliver physical infrastructure in advance or in parallel to developments. 14.0.17 Major sites in the Romford Strategic Development Area and the Rainham and Beam Park Strategic Development Area are anticipated to deliver over 6,000 and 3,000 homes respectively over the Plan period, with the new increased number of economically affluent residents living in well-designed homes in Romford and Rainham and Beak Park centres. Funding secured from developer contributions 14.0.18 Various policies in the Local Plan contain requirements for developers to make financial contributions to make the development acceptable in planning terms. The Council will use Section 106 planning obligations funding (in accordance with paragraphs 203 – 205 of the National Planning Policy Framework) to address or mitigate potential unacceptable impacts associated with developments. 14.0.19 In due course, the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) will enable the Council to secure funding towards the cost of infrastructure to meet the needs arising from new developments. 14.0.20 Funds secured through CIL will be used to deliver key community infrastructure as such as education, health facilities, libraries, community care, community facilities, and transport projects (except certain site specific works). 14.0.21 The Council acknowledges however that CIL, on its own, will be insufficient to fund big new capital projects and it will remain necessary for other funding sources and regimes to be explored and considered. Development Management 14.0.22 The Local Plan and the London Plan will be the main basis for decision making and managing development in the borough. The Council will seek to facilitate new development through working proactively and positively with developers to ensure proposals come forward in a timely manner. 14.0.23 The Council will, through its pre-application process, seek to ensure that developers are fully aware of the requirements of the Local Plan’s expectations and objectives.

It is intended that these several initiatives will help the Council and its partners deliver better places. Monitoring the Local Plan 14.0.27 The Council recognises that it will be very difficult to anticipate all the ways in which change will happen in a borough as dynamic as Havering within a wide Metropolitan London and sub- regional context. 14.0.28 The Local Plan took account of the best possible evidence and research information available when it was prepared. Whilst this gives a sound basis for the Plan’s overall direction and policies, it is acknowledged that over the Plan Period circumstances may change. In this circumstance, the Council may wish to adjust the Plan’s direction or policies. In particular, it is recognised that the latter stages of the Local Plan have been prepared concurrently with revisions to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) by the Government and the Mayor of London preparing a draft new London Plan. Changes in national and Mayoral planning policy will need to be assessed to ensure that Havering’s planning policies remain up to date and appropriate for Havering. In the light of these factors, the Council will bring forward an update of the Local Plan immediately after its adoption. 14.0.29 Notwithstanding the commitment to an update of the Local Plan, and pending the adoption of a new strategy, the Council will monitor the effectiveness of the Local Plan in delivering its objectives. It will do this by regularly assessing its performance against a series of identified key monitoring indicators. The Council will publish the results of these assessments via its Authority Monitoring Report on an annual basis. The monitoring indicators listed in Table 18 of Annex 8 will be used to monitor the delivery of each local plan policy. The indicators have specifically been selected to address every policy as far as possible. The indicators are supported by relevant targets, where appropriate, and the extent to which the Local Plan secures these targets will be an important consideration in determining the Council’s approach in its update. 14.0.30 The Council will review policies where it is clear that targets are not met on a consistent basis over time and / or where they fail to be met by a significant amount when considered individually. The Council recognises that given the focus on providing new homes, the indicators and targets for Places to live are especially important. Policy 3 and the Housing Position Statement: Technical Update (October 2019) outline the Council’s approach to maintaining a five year supply of housing land and meeting its housing targets. The Council will also keep under review the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers and Travelling Showpeople by undertaking regular reviews of its Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment. 14.0.31 In addition, the Government’s Housing Delivery Test in the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) sets a minimum threshold for housing delivery over a three year period. If delivery falls below this threshold, the Council will need to produce a Housing Action Plan in line with national guidance. The Housing Action Plan will identify reasons for under-delivery, examine ways to reduce the risk of further under-delivery and set out measures the authority will take to improve delivery. 14.0.32 Another key task will be to keep under review the need for other documents to be brought forward to support the Local Plan and to help deliver the Council’s priorities which are linked to it. These may come forward as statutory or non-statutory documents and may be topic or area based. 14.0.33 The Council at this stage does not wish to be prescriptive about this. In all cases it will consider carefully the need for the item and such factors as the most appropriate means of securing its preparation and delivery and its available resources.

      "content": "A.2 Policy Context The National Planning Policy Framework 2012 A.2.1 The National Planning Policy Framework set out the Governments Planning policies for England and how these are expected to be applied. The Havering Local Plan is required to be consistent with the framework. A.2.2 The core principle of the NPPF is a ‘presumption in favour of sustainable development’, which should be seen as a 'golden thread' running through both plan-making and decision-taking. There are three dimensions to sustainable development: economic, social and environmental and it is the role of the planning system to balance these dimensions. A.2.3 The NPPF sets out detailed guidance in relation to key planning principles including building a strong economy; ensuring the vitality of town centres; promoting sustainable transport; delivering a wide choice of affordable homes; good design; promoting healthy communities; protecting open space and the built environment; conserving the historic environment; and meeting the challenge of climate change. A.2.4 The NPPF is supported by Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) which adds further context to the Framework. It is intended that the two documents should be read together. The London Plan (Consolidated with Alterations Since 2011) A.2.5 The London Plan 2015 is the Spatial Development Strategy produced by the Mayor of London setting out the integrated social, economic and environmental framework for the future development and growth of the city. A.2.6 The Havering Local Plan is required to be in general conformity with the London Plan. The London Plan is also part of the statutory Development Plan for the borough and has to be taken in account in the determination of planning applications. A.2.7 The London Plan contains detailed policies which must be considered alongside the Local Plan. The London Plan recognises the unique characteristics of outer London and in appropriate cases it is possible for locally specific policy provisions to be made through Local Plans. A.2.8 Specifically in relation to Havering the London Plan: Sets a minimum housing target of 11,700 new homes between 2015 – 2025; Identifies London Riverside (including Rainham and Beam Park) as an Opportunity Area (an opportunity area has significant potential for new residential and economic development); Identifies Romford as a metropolitan centre and Hornchurch, Upminster, Collier Row, Harold Hill, Rainham and Elm Park as district centres; Identifies Rainham Employment Area, Harold Hill Industrial Estate and King George Close Estate, Romford as Strategic Industrial Locations (protected for industrial use); Set an annual indicative benchmark of 185 specialist housing units for older people between 2015 - 2025; Identifies Havering as one of four minerals boroughs and sets a land back apportionment. A.2.9 Following the election of a new London Mayor in 2016, a review of the London Plan is underway. At this stage it is anticipated that a new London Plan will be adopted in late 2018. The Local Plan can be reviewed in part if the new London Plan has significant implications on the local planning context. At this early stage in the preparation of the London Plan it is not possible to anticipate its significance. The Council will work closely with the Mayor of London to ensure that Havering’s priorities and aspirations are reflected in a new Plan. 108 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

      "content": "A.3 Spatial Portrait and Key Issues A.3.1 The Spatial Portrait provides a summary of the key characteristics of Havering as it is now and identifies the key issues to be addressed by the Local Plan. Havering's Location A.3.2 Havering is an outer London borough in North East London, situated just 13 miles from the City of London. Havering is also London’s third largest borough, extending to approximately 43 square miles and home to an increasingly diverse and vibrant population of more than 249,000 people. A.3.3 Located on the London/Essex border, the borough is adjoined by the London Boroughs of Redbridge and Barking and Dagenham to the west, Epping Forest to the north, Bexley to the south beyond the river Thames and by the Essex Districts of Thurrock and Brentwood to the east. Havering's Places A.3.4 Romford is the largest town centre in Havering, a designated metropolitan centre, it is home to an extensive retail offer that serves a wider catchment which extends into several neighbouring boroughs and even into parts of the wider South East region. As one of outer London's major growth and regeneration areas, the area offers exciting development and regeneration opportunities over the next 15 years and will accommodate a significant level of housing and economic growth alongside new and enhanced supporting infrastructure. A.3.5 There are smaller but significant retail centres at Hornchurch, Upminster, Rainham, Elm Park, Harold Hill and Collier Row. Hornchurch is the borough's cultural centre, home to the Queens Theatre and Fairkytes Art Centre. Hornchurch and Neighbouring Upminster are the two largest centres outside of Romford. A.3.6 Rainham and Beam Park in the south of the borough is a further major growth and regeneration area and provides the opportunity to establish an exciting new residential neighbourhood linked to the delivery of a new railway station on the existing Essex Thameside line at Beam Park. Havering's Population and Households A.3.7 Havering is currently home to a population of over 249,000 and is expected to grow significantly to over 290,000 by 2031. [(21)] . The number of households is forecast to grow in the same period, reflecting the trend of households becoming smaller in size. Compared to London as a whole, Havering has a low proportion of one person households and a low proportion of households comprising of married couples with no dependent children. Conversely, Havering has the highest proportion in London of households comprising couples with dependent children. In term of the age composition of the population, Havering has the highest proportion of older people of any London borough [(22)] . This projected increase in the borough's share of the elderly represents a key issue for the Council. The Local Plan must therefore address the needs of an increasingly ageing population, in particular demands on extra care accommodation, and the need to create accessible environments and homes adapted to the exigencies of life which are equally important for households with very young children. A.3.8 Within the same plan period there are forecast increases in the proportion of the very young, with the share of under 4's in the borough currently at 6.1% and rapidly growing [(23)] . This too represents a key issue for the Council to address, with demand for school places, recreational and leisure facilities, health centres and suitable family accommodation to soon outstrip current provision. The Local Plan therefore must ensure that increasing needs for such social infrastructure are placated. A.3.9 There are currently 100,660 households in Havering [(24)], with the composition of the households changing due in part to changing social trends. The period to 2031 is likely to see an increase in one person households particularly among the elderly, as well as increasing demand for larger family dwellings as the share of married couples with dependent children proliferates. The population/household figures reflect the results of the 2013 London Housing Capacity Study.

      "content": "estimates that there is potential for 1,170 homes per year to be built in Havering for the ten year period 2015 - 2025. A key issue for the Local Plan to address will therefore be to ensure the right mix of new housing is provided with regard to Havering's changing population composition whilst maintaining and enhancing the borough's residential character. As well as ensuring that the types and sizes of new housing meets forecast demand, the Local Plan needs to address the issue of housing 'affordability'. In 2016, the estimated average gross earned household income was £44,430, whilst the average house price was £394,000, far outstripping average household income by more than 8 times [(25)] . A key issue for the Local Plan will be to ensure an appropriate level and type of affordable housing is provided for those on low and intermediate incomes to help address increased incidences of homelessness, ensure everyone has access to a decent home, whilst having regard to the economics of supply. A.3.10 Although 70% of the population in Havering are home owners, which is one of the highest proportions across all London boroughs, the provision of new housing in the borough represents a considerable issue for the Council to resolve. This is in part due to a failure in recent years to meet housing delivery targets and as such, there is now a supply and demand issue to contend with. This has impacted across all facets of the housing market, with affordable family housing (3-4 bed) in particular need. This issue is further compounded by the considerable lack of available and sufficient brownfield land in the borough. With over half of the borough classified as Green Belt, the Council must focus delivery on a finite number of brownfield sites. As a result, the Plan must strike a careful balance, between the provision of new homes, and ensuring land is available for the many other competing land uses. A.3.11 With the borough's population set to increase significantly over the lifetime of the plan,the Council must ensure the sufficient delivery of high quality homes to meet the increasing need as well as delivering on affordable housing commitments as set out in the Local Plan. Education A.3.12 Of Havering’s 82 state funded schools, 61 are Primary, 18 are Secondary and 3 are Special Schools. There are also six Independent Schools and one Alternative Provision Academy. However, there is a growing need for school places in the borough as the borough's population continues to grow and consequently, ensuring the needs of existing and future residents are met remains a key issue for the Council. A.3.13 Further education is provided in Havering through ‘Havering College of Further and Higher Education’, ‘Havering Adult College’ and ‘Manor Park College’, as well as a series of libraries and other centres. A.3.14 A key issue for the Local Plan will be to seek to remedy the existing deficiencies in service and facility provision, especially spatial inequalities in the distribution and availability of facilities in different parts of the borough, especially in those areas with poor educational attainment. Health A.3.15 Havering belongs to the Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, with Queen's Hospital in Romford the borough's principle Hospital. Queens continues to serve an ever growing catchment and plays an increasingly significant role in the provision of care for Havering residents. One of the main issues affecting quality of life however is access to local doctors and medical services, and this is governed mainly by lengthy GP lists. There are currently 52 GP practises covering a total of 256,731 patients and consequently, this has led to long GP waiting times. A.3.16 Havering is a relatively affluent borough, however, there are pockets of deprivation to the north (Gooshays and Heaton wards) and south (South Hornchurch), which has led to the existence of health inequalities in the borough. While life expectancy overall is above national average for people living in Havering, (84.1 years for women, and 79.1 years for men), there remains significant inequality in life expectancy across the borough, impacted by where people live and the circumstances of their upbringing. Currently, the disparity in life expectancy between the most deprived and least deprived (26) in Havering stands at 6.9 years for men, and 3.6 years for women . 25 Havering JSNA 2016 p6 26 Public Health England, Borough Health Profile 2016 110 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

      "content": "A.3.17 A key issue for the Local Plan therefore will be ensuring that the needs of existing and new households are met, that existing spatial inequalities particularly in healthcare are remedied, and that local deprivation is tackled at source. Business Growth and Economic Activity A.3.18 The key employment sectors in Havering are Human Health and Social Care Work, Retail, Administrative and Support Service Activities, Education and Construction. The overall employment rate in Havering is high, with around 76.5% of working age residents in Havering in employment between January 2015 and December 2015 [(27)] . A.3.19 Havering has a high number of micro and small businesses, with Havering's Employment Land Review (2015) reporting that over 90% of businesses in the borough are micro companies with up to nine employees and a further 7% as small enterprises with between 10 and 49 employees. However, the Council's business survey indicates that the costs of rents and poor availability of suitable affordable premises are the main factors in driving businesses out of the borough and consequently, presents a key issue for the Local Plan to address. As a result, the provision and preservation of affordable and suitable workspaces should be actively encouraged to increase the opportunities for small businesses which are both a catalyst for regeneration and essential to Havering’s economic vitality. A.3.20 Although employment rates are stable, there is however a lower proportion of Havering residents in high skilled jobs compared to other outer London boroughs, reflected in the average gross income -­ £44,430 compared to the London average of £51,770. This places Havering within the lowest third of all London boroughs [(28)] . While Havering has good schools, academic qualifications are low; 35% aged 16 and over have no qualifications in the most deprived areas and 35% have qualifications at Level 1 or 2 (Level 2 is equivalent to a GCSE grade A*-C). [(29)] This is further compounded by evidence to suggest that just 26% of the borough's population are graduates, in stark contrast to the Greater London and National averages of 50% and 37% respectively [(30)] . Resolving the attainment gap is a clearly a key issue for the borough, as a highly skilled workforce attracts enterprise and development, higher wages and consequently, increases in the prosperity of the borough. Improving access to training will help increase employment opportunities for Havering residents, reduce the mismatch between available skills and skills required and help alleviate spatial inequalities in the borough, and is a key issue the Local Plan should seek to promote. Town Centres A.3.21 Havering’s town centres are a focus for retailing, services, employment and increasingly a place to live. Romford is Havering’s main centre, serving Essex, East London and the Thames Gateway. It has benefited hugely from major new developments and major regeneration works are currently underway. The borough is also served by six district centres, at Upminster, Hornchurch, Elm Park, Collier Row, Rainham and Harold Hill, with Upminster and Hornchurch the largest of the district centres. There is also a diffuse network of local centres which provide day to day shops and services for residents, especially the borough’s elderly and those less mobile. A.3.22 Retailing is the main function of Havering’s town centres and is, by far, the main source of employment in the borough. Whilst the future viability of the town centres will depend on securing the right mix of shops, services, cultural and community facilities and housing, retail will continue to be their raison d’etre. A.3.23 Havering's close proximity to nearby shopping malls like Lakeside, Bluewater and Westfield Stratford does however place its centres in a vulnerable position and consequently, enhancing the vitality and viability of the borough’s town centres by planning for future retail growth and increasing their attractiveness by facilitating a diversity of different uses remains a key issue for the Council. 27 28 29 30 Nomis, 2015 Havering JSNA 2016 p6 A research study into skills and employment in Havering – Renaisi 2014 Annual Population Survey, 2014 Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021 London Borough of Havering 111",

      "content": "Transport A.3.24 Havering has good access to Greater London, Essex, Kent, and the rest of the South East via its strategic transport connections and routes. These include road links such as the M25, A12, A13 and A127 and rail links such as the Great Eastern Mainline railway (GEML), TfL Rail, Essex Thameside line, London Overground, and the London Underground District Line. However, while east-west connections through the existing transport network are good, north-south connectivity is extremely limited. Significantly, improved transport connections between Rainham, and Romford are needed to support the two emerging Housing Zones, but also to improve access to Crossrail and the new station to be built at Beam Park. Resolving the historically poor north-south links across the borough remains a key issue for the Council to resolve, and is currently the subject of talks regarding a key transport intervention scheme to remedy such concerns. A.3.25 Population growth over the lifetime of the Plan provides additional transport related issues within the borough, relating specifically to congestion at peak times via its strategic road network and rail services, as well as pollution along key transport interchanges. Consequently, a key issue for the Local Plan will be to aim to minimise the need to travel through the location and design of new development and its relationship to transport links and users. Where travel is necessary, to promote sustainable forms of transport whilst recognising that people will continue to use their cars. This is a major issue in London Riverside where future growth particularly housing and tourism is predicated on significant improvements to public transport. A.3.26 Car use and car ownership levels in the borough, the second highest in London presents a further issue for the Plan to contend with. The 2011 census revealed that 77% of households in Havering have access to at least one car and of households with access to 2 or more cars, Havering likewise holds the second highest proportion of any London borough, reflecting its location as an outer London borough. Car use is linked to issues of congestion and air quality and consequently, providing Havering residents with the options to walk, cycle and use public transport that is accessible will be important factors in trying to deliver modal shift in peoples behaviour. Environment A.3.27 Havering is one of London’s greenest boroughs, with half its 43 square miles designated as green belt land. Furthermore, Havering has an extensive and varied network of open space and parks including the Thames Chase Community Forest, 93 Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation, 3 Countryside Conservation Areas and seven local nature reserves. Havering also contains several large rivers and 7 wildlife corridors that run through the borough. A.3.28 Of Havering’s extensive green space offer, 11 of its parks and recreational open spaces hold the prestigious Green Flag status. There are also a series of protected species home to Havering, with a list that includes bats, the brown owl, great crested newts, water voles, badgers, harvest mice, the brown hare, stag beetle and other Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) species. Evidently the borough’s open spaces and waterways support a wealth of wildlife and biodiversity and consequently, a key issue for the Local Plan to address will be ensuring the right balance is struck between continuing protection and expansion of the borough's existing network of green spaces and accommodating investment and development. A.3.29 Air quality however remains a further issue, with the borough formally declared an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) for both Nitrogen Dioxide (NO 2 ) and Particulate Matter (PM 10 ), with issues arising particularly at key transport interchanges [(31)] . Consequently, a key issue for the Local Plan will be how best to further improve Havering's air quality and reduce the need to travel by promoting a more sustainable pattern of development and sustainable forms of transport. Climate Change A.3.30 The biggest contributors of carbon emissions in the borough are domestic, industry and commercial uses, however, evidence is beginning to show an overall improvement in the borough's total CO 2 emissions. This may be due in part to a general increase in the amount of renewable energy generated 31 London Borough of Havering - Air Quality Action Plan 2017 - 2022 112 London Borough of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021",

Havering currently has the fifth highest number of solar photovoltaic installations on buildings of all London boroughs [(32)], and this is further supported by three large wind turbines, energy-from-waste facilities and future renewable energy projects in the pipeline. A.3.31 A key issue for the Local Plan will therefore be how best to enhance and protect the environment and plan for and minimise the causes of climate change, whilst planning for adaptation and mitigation of its effects through the development process. It would need to focus on reducing the borough's carbon footprint and increasing the share of energy generated through local renewable means and promoting sustainable forms of construction. Heritage A.3.32 Havering has a diverse range of important heritage assets. There are currently 6 Grade I, 15 Grade II* and over a hundred Grade II listed buildings, 11 designated conservation areas including; Corbets Tey, Cranham, Gidea Park, Havering-atte-Bower, Langtons, North Ockendon, RAF Hornchurch, Rainham, Romford, St Andrews and St Leonards and one listed garden - Upminster Court Gardens. A.3.33 Special townscape or landscape character areas are areas that have a special and unique character which adds to the townscape and landscape quality of Havering, of which Havering currently has two; Emerson Park, which is typified by large and varied dwellings set in spacious, mature, well landscaped grounds, and the Hall Lane Policy Area typified by large detached and semi-detached dwellings set in large gardens with considerable tree and shrub planting. All of the areas have unique characters which add considerable value to the borough’s environment. A.3.34 There is just one listed garden in Havering - Upminster Court Gardens, 11 sites on the Heritage in Risk register, including 7 grade II and 2 grade II* listed buildings and just 1 scheduled monument which can be found within the Romford conservation area. A.3.35 A key issue for the Local Plan will therefore be how best to preserve and enhance the borough’s heritage assets without constraining new development and to consider the role they can play in regeneration. Waste and Minerals A.3.36 Havering is a member of the East London Waste Authority (ELWA) alongside the London Boroughs of Redbridge, Barking and Dagenham and Newham, who share collective responsibility for the disposal of waste produced by each local authority. The ELWA, since its inception in 1986, has strived to implement waste hierarchy principles to recycle and reuse as much waste as possible, limiting the amount sent to landfill which is both costly and environmentally damaging. In 2015/16, 32% of household waste in Havering was either recycled, re-used or composted, and this figure has been increasing steadily year upon year since 2011. A.3.37 A key issue now for the borough is to continue building upon recent successes in recycling and re-using of waste materials and continuing to implement measures to reduce waste sent to landfill. A.3.38 In terms of minerals, the London Plan identifies Havering as one of four areas with the potential to maintain an aggregate apportionment that can make a significant contribution to the future provision of materials for building. In this regard, Havering is required to plan for a seven year sand and gravel landbank of at least 1.75 million tonnes. The Council has a mineral safeguarding area in respect of this, noting minerals can only be worked where they are naturally found and seeks to protect known resources from undue sterilisation. In recent years, planning permission has been granted for two new quarries in the Rainham and Wennington Area: East Hall Farm which opened in 2016 and Wennington Hall Farm which was granted permission in 2017 but has yet to commence. Factoring the reserve at these two sites, as of the start of May 2017, the landbank in Havering is estimated at 8.7 years with over 2.1 million tonnes of reserve with planning permission. A.3.39 A key issue for the Council is to ensure that after such extractive activity has concluded, quality phased restoration is carried out that secures long lasting community and environmental benefits. 32 DECC, 2014 Local Plan 2016-2031 Adopted 2021 London Borough of Havering 113",

A.4.2 The Council has also received 80 representations from landowners and their agents asking the Council to consider removing sites from the Green Belt. A number of these representations were submitted during the formal consultation period. However, the majority of these sites have been submitted to the Council during the Local Plan process but outside of the formal consultation period. Direction of Travel consultation A.4.3 In November 2016 the Council published a Local Plan Direction of Travel (DoT) document as a way of engaging with and keeping stakeholders up to date on the progress of the Local Plan, its timeframe for delivery, as well as the emerging vision, strategic objections and spatial strategy. A total of 20 responses were received. A.4.4 The Direction of Travel document does not form part of the statutory plan making process and was not subject to formal consultation.

The 'Duty' is set out in Section 33A of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 (as amended by Section 110 of the Localism Act). The Council has prepared a separate statement which sets out how the Duty to Co-operate has been fulfilled for the preparation of the Local Plan. Sustainability Appraisal A.5.2 Development Plan Documents must be subject to Sustainability Appraisal (SA) which is an integral part of the plan preparation process. SA involves identifying and evaluating a plan’s impacts having regard to social, environmental and economic impacts and helps to ensure that the plan accords with sustainable development principles. Sustainability appraisals incorporate the requirements of the European Directive 2001/42/EC on the ‘assessment of effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment’ (SEA Directive). Equalities Impact Assessment A.5.3 An Equalities Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out as part of the Local Plan process to assess the likely (or actual) effects of policy on the seven protected characteristics, including age, disability, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation and marital status. The process provided the opportunity to better utilise policy to further promote equality that had otherwise been missed as well as removing or amending negative or adverse impacts where possible. Although a legal requirement, fundamentally, the production of an equalities impact assessment was deemed an effective way of improving policy development and service delivery by ensuring the Council always considered the needs of their communities above all else, identified potential steps to promote equality and does not discriminate. Health Impact Assessment A.5.4 A Health Impact Assessment (HIA) was carried out during the preparation of the Local Plan to help ensure that health and wellbeing were fully considered. The HIA assesses the potential effects of the Local Plan policies on the health of Havering's residents and recommends actions to mitigate any negative impacts.

  A reusable prompt template DSL for prioritizing relevant Local Plan policies
  based on specific planning application context. Designed for use with ANY
  Local Plan structure. The output includes policy ID, Title, and Summary.
  To be filled with runtime data and executed by a target LLM.

# Variables for the template
variables:
  - name: location_description
    description: "Address or textual description of the site location and its context."
    example: "Former factory site, designated Employment Area, edge of town."
  - name: application_type
    description: "The type of planning application."
    example: "Outline Planning Permission (all matters reserved)"
  - name: proposed_development_description
    description: "Brief description of the proposed development."
    example: "Residential development (Use Class C3), approx 50 units."
  - name: geospatial_constraints
    description: "List of known geospatial factors affecting the site."
    example: ["Within designated Employment Area", "Adjacent to railway line (noise potential)", "Potential for contamination"]
  - name: candidate_policies # Input list of policies to prioritize
    description: >
      List of candidate policies (each an object with 'id', 'title', 'summary')
      from the relevant Local Plan. The prompt requires access to these details
      to include them in the output.
    example: # Structure example - IDs/Titles are Local Plan specific
      [
        { id: "SP1", title: "Sustainable Development", summary: "Core strategy principle..." },
        { id: "EC1", title: "Protection of Employment Land", summary: "Resist loss of employment sites..." },
        { id: "DM8", title: "Noise and Vibration", summary: "Mitigating noise impacts..." },
        { id: "DM9", title: "Contaminated Land", summary: "Requires assessment and remediation..." },
        { id: "H1", title: "Principle of Housing Development", summary: "Location criteria for new housing..." }
      ]
  - name: desired_policy_count
    description: "The target number of top-priority policies the user wants returned."
    example: 10

# The core prompt template - Generic and adaptable
prompt_template: |
  You are an expert UK Planning Policy Analyst. Your task is to rank the candidate Local Plan policies below based on their importance and centrality for assessing the specific planning application described. Assume the policies provided are from the relevant Local Plan for the site location.

  **Application Context:**
  *   Location: {{ location_description }}
  *   Application Type: {{ application_type }}
  *   Proposed Development: {{ proposed_development_description }}
  *   Site Constraints: {{ geospatial_constraints | join(', ') if geospatial_constraints else 'None listed' }}

  **Candidate Local Plan Policies to Prioritize:**
  ```
  {# Concise formatting for the policy list #}
  {% for policy in candidate_policies %}
  - ID: {{ policy.id }}
    Title: {{ policy.title }}
    Summary: {{ policy.summary }}
  {% endfor %}
  ```

  **Core Prioritization Principles:**
  1.  **Constraints & Principle First:** Give highest priority to policies directly addressing listed **Site Constraints** (e.g., Employment Area, Flood Zone, Heritage policies) and those governing the fundamental **Principle** of the proposed development (acceptability of use/scale here).
  2.  **Proposed Use:** Prioritize policies regulating the specific **Proposed Development** described (e.g., housing mix/density for residential; design, amenity, transport policies relevant to the scale/type).
  3.  **Context Matters:** Adjust ranking based on the **Application Type** (Outline focuses on principle/strategy, Full on details) and the specific combination of constraints and proposal impacts.
  4.  **Focus on Impact:** Prioritize policies likely to be **determinative** or represent major assessment hurdles for *this* specific application. Rank only the policies provided.

  **Required Output:**
  Return ONLY a valid JSON list containing objects. Each object MUST represent one of the prioritized candidate policies and MUST have the keys 'id', 'title', and 'summary'. The list should contain approximately {{ desired_policy_count }} policy objects and MUST be ordered from most critical policy to least critical based on the principles above.

  Example object format: {"id": "POLICY_ID", "title": "Policy Title", "summary": "Policy summary text..."}

# Notes on the expected output format from the target LLM
output_format_notes: >
  Output must be a single JSON list of objects.
  Each object must have keys: "id" (string), "title" (string), "summary" (string).
  The list must be ordered by descending priority (most important first).
  No other text outside the JSON list.

    ]
  _rationale_for_example_output: >
    EC1 (Employment Land) is top priority due to direct conflict with proposal principle on a constrained site. H1 (Housing Principle) is next as it governs the proposed use location criteria (likely conflicting with EC1). DM5 (Amenity) is high due to adjacent industrial uses. SP1 (Core Principle) is relevant. INF1 (Infrastructure) is a standard consideration but less fundamental than the principle/constraint issues here for an Outline app.

Here are the key additional considerations for planning officers working in a London Borough:

1.  **The London Plan:**
    *   **Status:** This is the statutory Spatial Development Strategy for Greater London, prepared by the Mayor of London. Critically, it forms part of the statutory 'development plan' for each London Borough, alongside the Borough's own Local Plan.
    *   **Content:** It sets out an integrated economic, environmental, transport, and social framework for the development of London. It contains strategic policies on a wide range of issues, often setting specific targets or requirements for London that may differ from or add detail to national policy (NPPF).
    *   **Relationship with Local Plans:** Borough Local Plans must be in "general conformity" with the London Plan. Planning decisions must be taken in accordance with the development plan (i.e., *both* the Local Plan *and* the London Plan) unless material considerations indicate otherwise. The London Plan often carries significant weight.

2.  **Mayor of London's Powers:**
    *   **Strategic Application Referrals (PSI):** Certain planning applications of "Potential Strategic Importance" (PSI) must be referred to the Mayor of London / Greater London Authority (GLA) for review. Thresholds defining PSIs are set out in the Town and Country Planning (Mayor of London) Order 2008 (as amended) and relate to factors like scale (e.g., number of dwellings, height, floorspace), location (e.g., Green Belt, MOL), or type of development (e.g., waste facilities).
    *   **Mayoral Intervention:** The Mayor has powers to:
        *   Allow the Borough to determine the application itself.
        *   Direct the Borough to refuse the application (Stage 2 referral).
        *   Take over determination of the application ('call-in'), becoming the local planning authority for that specific case (Stage 3).
    *   **Implications:** This means Borough planning officers must assess applications against London Plan policies from the outset and manage the referral process with the GLA Planning team for relevant applications.

3.  **London Plan Policies (Examples of London-Specific Emphasis):**
    *   **Housing:** Often includes specific London targets for affordable housing delivery (e.g., Strategic Target of 50%, threshold approach, tenure split preferences, Fast Track Route for viability), build-to-rent policies, and policies on housing density/optimisation (using a design-led approach and density matrix).
    *   **Design:** Strong emphasis on high-quality design, tall building policies, character assessments, and public realm. May include specific requirements related to inclusive design.
    *   **Environment:** Policies often go further than national policy, e.g., requirement for Urban Greening Factor (UGF) calculations, air quality neutral/positive requirements, specific targets for CO2 reduction beyond Building Regulations (Be Lean, Be Clean, Be Green energy hierarchy), requirements for Whole Life-Cycle Carbon assessments.
    *   **Transport:** Strong integration with Transport for London (TfL) objectives, emphasis on public transport, walking and cycling (Healthy Streets Approach), London-specific car parking standards (often much lower/car-free), requirements for construction logistics plans and delivery/servicing plans.
    *   **Economy:** Policies protecting and providing industrial land (Strategic Industrial Locations - SILs, Locally Significant Industrial Sites - LSISs), specific office policies (location, mix, affordability), policies supporting culture and creative industries.
    *   **Heritage:** Includes the London View Management Framework (LVMF) protecting designated strategic views towards landmarks like St Paul's Cathedral and the Palace of Westminster.

4.  **Supplementary Planning Guidance (SPGs) / London Plan Guidance (LPGs):**
    *   The Mayor issues SPGs/LPGs to provide further detail on how to implement specific London Plan policies (e.g., Affordable Housing and Viability SPG, Housing Design Standards LPG, Air Quality Neutral LPG, Urban Greening Factor LPG, Whole Life-Cycle Carbon LPG). These are important material considerations in decision-making.

5.  **Mayoral Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL):**
    *   In addition to any CIL levied by the individual London Borough, the Mayor levies MCIL (currently MCIL2) across most of London (with different charging zones) primarily to help fund strategic transport infrastructure projects (historically Crossrail/Elizabeth Line). This needs to be factored into viability assessments and CIL calculations.

6.  **Transport for London (TfL):**
    *   As the strategic transport authority, TfL is a key statutory consultee on many planning applications in London, particularly PSIs or those affecting the Transport for London Road Network (TLRN) or public transport services. Their input on transport assessments, travel plans, parking, Healthy Streets, road safety, and infrastructure requirements is highly influential.

7.  **Opportunity Areas (OAs):**
    *   The London Plan identifies specific Opportunity Areas across London capable of accommodating substantial new housing, commercial, and other development. These areas often have specific policy frameworks or planning briefs associated with them, guiding large-scale regeneration. There are also specific designations like 'Strategic Areas for Regeneration'.

8.  **Specific London Designations:**
    *   Metropolitan Open Land (MOL): Afforded the same level of protection as Green Belt.
    *   Strategic Industrial Locations (SIL): Areas prioritised for industrial uses.
    *   London View Management Framework (LVMF): Protects designated views.

Therefore, a planning officer in a London Borough needs to be intimately familiar with not only the national planning system but also the London Plan, relevant Mayoral SPGs/LPGs, the Mayor's strategic role, MCIL, and the specific requirements imposed by this additional layer of strategic governance. They must constantly assess proposals against both Borough Local Plan policies *and* London Plan policies.

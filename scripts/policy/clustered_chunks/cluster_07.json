    "text": "The scope of an air quality assessment usually includes: z  An assessment of the existing baseline air quality in the vicinity of the proposed development. z  Identification of the opportunities and constraints on the site, and what measures can be taken at the design stage to avoid the need for mitigation later. z  Predictions of the future impact of the development, comparing the future scenario with and without the proposed development, but including all cumulative (consented) development. An AQA should include the following: z  Site location and brief description of the proposed development, and how it relates to existing air quality. z  Outline of the relevant planning and air quality policy (including odour and dust when appropriate). z  Description of the assessment methodology with appropriate data presented, to allow decision makers to assess the technical quality of the work and the assumptions underlying any model adjustments or verification factors.",

    "text": "Tower Hamlets Local Plan 265 TOWN CENTRES ensure that they provide spaces that support these uses, and any proposals non-Class E(a), E(b) or drinking establishment (Sui Generis) uses at ground floor level should demonstrate that they will complement and not undermine the existing mix of uses. More detail regarding nighttime uses is provided in Policy T7. 16.33 Part 6 of the policy recognizes that residential uses at ground or basement levels in town centres can provide a substandard level of amenity for residents, with particular issues around privacy. They can also have a sterilising effect on town centres, reducing the vibrancy and vitality of a shopping street and undermining its continuity. Exceptions will be made for residential entrances and lobbies as well as communal space where they support the activation of the street frontage.",

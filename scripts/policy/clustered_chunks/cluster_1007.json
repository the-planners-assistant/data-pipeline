However, play provision requirements must be provided in addition to other quantitative standards, such as open space provision and communal space provision. In order to demonstrate that the proposed play space is of high quality, applicants will be required to demonstrate how they have used Play Englandâ€™s 10 key design principles for creating successful play spaces.

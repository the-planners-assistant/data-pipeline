    "text": "BACK TO CONTENTS Routes and streets z Improve walking and cycling connections to and from the site, and provide public access to the waterfront at South Dock. Public routes on the east and west sides of the block should also be created, to establish public and accessible routes between Middle and South Docks. Environment and public realm z Prevent excessive overshadowing and enable activation of the riverside by ensuring buildings are stepped back from the water edge. z In line with the Integrated Water Management Plan for the Isle of Dogs and South Poplar, development on this site should provide an outfall for surface water drainage into the docks. z Due to the small size of this site, it cannot fulfil the requirement of policy DV8(1)(e) to provide 0.4ha of publicly accessible open space. Development on the site should therefore aim instead to provide smaller ‘pocket parks’ of publicly accessible open space and an improved public realm.",

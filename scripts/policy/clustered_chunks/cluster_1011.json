There is however a shortfall of industrial floorspace compared to demand as a result of significant losses of industrial land in the borough in recent years and the displacement of businesses into the borough from the City of London and other inner London boroughs where they have been forced out by higher rents and land values. As such, it is vital that existing provision is protected and that new floorspace is encouraged in appropriate locations to service the needs of local industry as well as the needs of central London more widely.

HOMES FOR THE COMMUNITY 12.15 Part 3 recognises that the acute need for more standard C3 housing in the borough means that the supply of this type of housing will normally be prioritised over other types of housing such as purposebuilt student accommodation and large-scale purpose-built shared living.

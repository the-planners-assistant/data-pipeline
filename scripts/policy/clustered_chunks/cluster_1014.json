Part of the buffer area lies within Tower Hamlets at Island Gardens on the Isle of Dogs, from where a classic view of the world heritage site can still be seen. 14.148 Part 1 of the policy sets out that these unique heritage assets must be safeguarded, and that development must not detract from the outstanding universal value for which they have been designated. 14.149 Under parts 2 and 3, proposals within close proximity to the Tower of London, or which have the potential to affect the setting and views of the Tower of London or Maritime Greenwich, will need to ensure they have regard to the Tower of London World Heritage Site Management Plan and/or the Maritime Greenwich World Heritage Site Management Plan.",

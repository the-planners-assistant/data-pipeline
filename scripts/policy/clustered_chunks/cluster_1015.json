    "text": "INTRODUCTION 4. What informs the development of the Local Plan? Evidence base 4.1 To support policies and site requirements, robust and justifiable evidence must be produced. This will ensure that the Local Plan is considered sound and best represents the community’s interest. Evidence base documents will consider market trends, population projections, on-site realities, expert input, and a range of quantitative and qualitative data to provide the best available information. The evidence has been prepared by either the council or other organisations including government bodies and comprises research studies, technical data, strategies, site masterplans and other technical information to cover the wide range of local plan policy areas. The evidence has also incorporated findings from the 2021 Census data that has been released to date. Growth and population projections have been informed by the Greater London Authority’s updates and releases.",

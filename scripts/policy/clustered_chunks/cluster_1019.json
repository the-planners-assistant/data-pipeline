    "text": "13.110 As the cost of providing clean mains water is set to increase over the lifetime of developments and retrofit is often prohibitively expensive and disruptive to residents, it is required that all major new development has the facility to generate and use non-potable water for uses such as WC flushing. To this end the buildingâ€™s plumbing system is to be able to collect storm runoff and grey water separately for reuse while foul water can be discharged to sewer. The water distribution system also is to be able to supply fitments as sinks and showers with potable quality water, while WCs are to be fed from a separate system that can distribute nonpotable water. A suitable plantroom area for the required equipment is to be identified.",

    "text": "BACK TO POLICIES Supporting text 18.51 This policy provides details of how the boroughâ€™s water spaces will be protected and how the various functions they offer are maintained and enhanced. 18.52 Part 1 requires development to demonstrate that it will not result in loss or covering of water space and that it will not compromise the suitability of the water space for water-related uses (as defined in Policy BO2). Further water loss and over-sailing from development will be resisted throughout the borough, particularly at locations that have experienced significant water space loss, such as West India South Dock, West India Middle Dock, West India North Dock, Blackwall Basin, and Poplar Dock in Canary Wharf.",

In this case, the supply of self-contained homes is defined as: existing housing (use Class C3 and other types of housing, including specialist accommodation), sites with planning permission for housing (use Class C3) and sites allocated in this plan or other development plan documents for the development of housing. 12.78 Part 1(c) sets out that LSPBSL should be genuinely mixed-use developments which offer more uses than merely residential and therefore optimises land use given the preferred locations as set out in Part 1 (d).",

    "text": "CLEAN AND GREEN FUTURE 13.32 The carbon content of electricity has been steadily reducing in recent years. In the 2000â€™s, when electricity had a carbon content of approximately 500 gCO2 e/kWh, heating systems that used gas such as boilers and CHP were considered more environmentally friendly options. This has now changed completely: the de-commissioning of coal-fired power stations and the rise of renewable energy have meant the annual average carbon content of electricity is now around 150-200 gCO2 e/ kWh, and is predicted to reduce further over the next decade. 13.33 Low carbon alternatives that are currently available include heat pumps and direct electric heating. Heat pumps use refrigerant to efficiently move heat from one place to another. Heat pumps can provide both space heating and domestic hot water, can serve individual homes or communal heating systems, and are highly energy efficient (typically around 250-300% for an air source heat pump).

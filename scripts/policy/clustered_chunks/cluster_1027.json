    "text": "13.22 Part 2(a) identifies an EUI target of no more than 35 kWh/ m2 GIA/yr for domestic buildings. The definition of domestic refers to a dwelling that houses a single or multiple households. This applies to C3 (Dwellinghouse) and C4 (House in multiple occupation) planning use classes. This target also applies to student or keyworker accommodation, care homes, and extra-care homes. 13.23 Part 2(b) Sets out different targets for non-domestic buildings based on their use, based on extensive predictive energy modelling within the Delivering Net Zero study (2023). Non-domestic buildings include warehouse and industrial, schools, office, retail, and HE facilities, GP surgeries, and hotels. Where a non-domestic development does not have an applicable category of use outlined in the policy, the applicant should discuss with the council to identify an appropriate EUI target. 110 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO POLICIES",

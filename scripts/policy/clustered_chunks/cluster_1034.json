    "text": "18.76 Part 2 implements the Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) approach to development, where the biodiversity on the site and its surroundings are improved relative to the pre-development baseline. Where biodiversity is reduced as a result of development, the enhancements to biodiversity provided through the development should provide greater overall biodiversity value than that lost. Given the nature of development sites in the borough, many are likely to have very low baseline levels of biodiversity. To ensure that this does not result in an excessively low biodiversity increase, developments must deliver a must deliver a minimum of 2.5 biodiversity unit (BU) per hectare or 30% gain (whichever is higher) in habitat value for wildlife, as measured against the pre-development biodiversity baseline. BNG must be calculated using an appropriate Biodiversity Metric. This applies to all major development proposals, and minor developments which are not exempt",

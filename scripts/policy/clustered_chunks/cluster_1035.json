The design, siting and layout of new development should be considered in the wider context and be sensitive to the existing character and identity of the BACK TO POLICIES area. This does not require proposals for new development to copy surrounding buildings â€“ imaginative and innovative interpretations of the local context can be the starting point for high-quality architecture and can contribute positively to the character of a neighbourhood, but only where they have been carefully considered, refined, and consulted on to ensure that they respond to the needs of the community.",

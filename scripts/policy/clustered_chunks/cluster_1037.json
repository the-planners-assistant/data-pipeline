Such growth will be delivered to retain, reinforce, and protect the historic character of Tower Hamlets to ensure the identity of our neighbourhoods, communities, and townscapes remain special and distinctive. b. \u0007Important views and landmarks across the borough that make architectural, cultural, or aesthetic contributions will be protected and where possible enhanced. c. \u0007Arts and cultural event spaces and businesses will be encouraged to flourish and supported to thrive as part of the distinct identity of communities.",

Some site allocations specify that a strategic open space should be delivered, and this is elaborated in part 1(e). For allocations that do not specify the need for a strategic open space, publicly accessible open spaces that meet local needs should be delivered instead, with a target of delivering at least 0.4 hectares across the site (it is acknowledged that on smaller allocations this level may not be achievable, however some amount of new publicly accessible open space is expected to be provided and discussions should be opened with the council at the earliest opportunity to discuss this). In all cases, family housing within site allocations should be delivered in close proximity to publicly accessible open space.",

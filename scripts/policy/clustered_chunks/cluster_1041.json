    "text": "Employment 8.34 There were an estimated 323,000 jobs in Tower Hamlets in 2021, a number which is expected to increase to 439,000 by 2026. Average weekly earnings in Tower Hamlets are significantly higher than the London and UK averages, with the average full-time worker in the borough earning Â£797.30/week in 2020. Despite this strong economic growth, there is no correlation between the economic growth of the borough and better living standards for some people. A significant portion of residents are living next to a thriving economy unable to reap its benefits. Fewer than 15% of jobs in the borough are taken by borough residents, and Tower Hamlets has the highest worklessness rate in London and 14% of residents have no qualifications - twice the London average. Persistent inequality requires further intervention in order for residents to access the benefits from the economic development. The skills of many residents are ill suited to the new jobs that are being created.",

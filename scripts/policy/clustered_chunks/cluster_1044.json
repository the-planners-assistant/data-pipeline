It is recognised that other policies in this plan identify suitable locations for other land uses. Developments of other land uses, where supported by policy and/or site allocations, are not considered to undermine the supply of selfcontained units. Family housing requires particular protection, due to high levels of identified need. 12.45 In order to manage the current shortage of family homes (three or more bedrooms), part 3 ensures that proposals to convert family homes into smaller self-contained flats will be resisted, unless the conversion enables the retention of a family unit (3-plus bedrooms). Where possible, the family-sized unit should have access to external amenity space. 84 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO POLICIES",

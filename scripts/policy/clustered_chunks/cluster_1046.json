This prioritises a ‘retrofit-first’ approach, which encourages refurbishment and repurposing of buildings. Where this is not possible, demolition must be fully justified by demonstrating that options for retaining the existing buildings have been explored, and the carbon reductions/ environmental benefits/ public benefits of the new development will outweigh the carbon costs of development. Applicants must also undertake a pre-demolition audit to identify a bill of materials and assets that can be recovered for reuse. Developers are encouraged to sign up to a materials hub platform, to maximise the recovery and reuse of existing materials in other developments.",

    "text": "13.39 For smaller-scale developments where communal and heat network solutions are less likely to be feasible, individual heating systems such as air source heat pumps and ground source heat pumps should be prioritised as low carbon heat options. BACK TO POLICIES 13.40 New developments should also explore the uses of smart controls such as building energy management systems to ensure thermal comfort to building occupants which optimises the performance of networked heating solutions such as heat networks and communal systems. 13.41 Part 5 requires all development proposals to submit an energy assessment which demonstrates how on-site renewable energy and/or heat generation has been maximised, and how heat network providers have been engaged with. Applicants should refer to the GLA Energy Assessment Guidance (2022) for further guidance on submitting an energy assessment.",

    "text": "15.73 Part 1 of the policy seeks to retain railway arches in uses that make a positive contribution to the economy, culture, and community of Tower Hamlets. Railway arches in the borough contain a wide variety of uses, including light and heavy industry, food and drink production, arts, and culture and public -facing town centre uses. Given the variety of these uses, other policies may also be relevant; for example, proposals for ‘dark kitchens’, where there are regular food delivery pick-ups must have regard to Policy TC5; proposals for an arts and culture facility, or where there is an existing arts and culture facility, must have regard to Policy C5; proposals for public- facing town centre uses must have regard to the town centre policies.",

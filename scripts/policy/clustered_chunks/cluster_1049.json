Space for recreation is also essential for people of all ages and supports improved physical and mental health and wellbeing and provides spaces for residents to meet and interact socially, particularly with those outside of their existing social spheres. 18.99 It is important that play space is not restricted to parks but is integrated into a range of public spaces. This can help enable liminal spaces to become areas where people can play and rest, enabling good design. This will allow for the environment to become more engaging and connected to existing public space facilities.",

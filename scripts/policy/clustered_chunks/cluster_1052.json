Development proposals are required to maximise health benefits, minimise harm to health, and promote health equity for new and existing communities. This will be achieved by: a. designing for an inclusive built and natural environment, which considers and responds to the needs of the whole community regardless of age, gender or ability, and promotes physical activity where possible, including layouts that encourage walking and cycling. b. providing accessible and inclusive high-quality open spaces, culturally sensitive community facilities, and an equitable urban realm that supports walking, wheeling, other forms of active travel and social interaction; and c. ensuring internal spaces are well-ventilated to prevent damp and mould occurring and are appropriately sized to avoid overcrowding.

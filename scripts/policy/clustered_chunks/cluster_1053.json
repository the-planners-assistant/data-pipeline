The IDP sets out the projects across a range of infrastructure requirements which will help deliver the infrastructure needed to serve existing and emerging communities and businesses. The IDP is periodically updated to ensure it is responsive to the infrastructure requirements of the borough. These updates will be undertaken in consultation with both internal and external stakeholders such as service areas and infrastructure providers.",

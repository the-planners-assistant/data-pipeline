    "text": "The above design criteria apply to the airborne transmission of entertainment noise. The structure borne transmission of noise is regarded as more problematic as the noise tends to take on much more low frequency bias as it propagates through the structure and the noise is often radiated simultaneously from multiple elements of the structure e.g. floors, walls and ceilings, leading to an all-encompassing surrounding sense of perception; in addition structure borne noise can often be perceived as vibration as well as sound, adding to the adverse effect. Consequently, where there is a risk of structure borne transmission of entertainment noise to sensitive premises we may seek more stringent criteria than for airborne entertainment noise. Developers are therefore encouraged to consult with the councilâ€™s environmental health department at an early stage in the consideration of the scheme to address this issue and to submit proposals to mitigate the risk for review.",

    "text": "12.84 In order to meet the significant need in the borough for affordable housing, part 2 of this policy requires development proposals for LSPBSL to either provide a cash-in-lieu contribution to the provision of affordable housing elsewhere in the borough equivalent to the delivery of 50% affordable housing at the unit size and tenure mix set out in Tower Hamlets Local Plan 95 HOMES FOR THE COMMUNITY Policy HF2, or deliver 50% affordable housing on-site at the unit size and tenure mix set out in Policy HF2. Where the affordable housing is delivered on-site, this must be in the form of self-contained C3 housing and the development proposal should ensure that the service charges are affordable for the residents, meaning that they may need to restrict access to some shared amenities within the LSPBSL element. The affordable housing will need to meet the housing standards set out in Policy HF9.",

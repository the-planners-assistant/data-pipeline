The built environment will comprise welcoming spaces that design out crime and improve resilience to emergencies. c. \u0007Socially cohesive, mixed, balanced, and healthy communities will be promoted together with walkable neighbourhoods to enhance the population’s wider health and well-being and to address the wider determinants of mental health and deprivation. The effects from the high level of growth and construction will be managed to ensure minimised impacts to local communities. d. \u0007Initiatives to develop programmes and spaces for women from ethnic minority backgrounds and faith communities will be supported to empower women and to ensure an inclusive and cohesive community.",

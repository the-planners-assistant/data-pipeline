These areas tend to have a denser mix of uses than adjacent residential communities and can support the spillover of employment uses from designated employment locations.| |Town centre hierarchy||This sets out what role and function different centres in the borough perform in relation to each other and across London. In Tower Hamlets it includes: the Central Activities Zone, Tower Hamlets Activity Areas, Canary Wharf Metropolitan Centre and a series of District Centres, Neighbourhood Centres and Neighbourhood Parades.|",

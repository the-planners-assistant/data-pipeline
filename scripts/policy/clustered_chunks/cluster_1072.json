    "text": "asset. 14.141 The borough contains some sites where historic street surfaces or street furniture (such as bollards, street signs, and coal hole covers) are present, and part 13 requires these features to be preserved and enhanced by development of adjacent sites. Historic surfaces can cause difficulties for those who use wheelchairs or have other mobility impairments, or for parents with pushchairs, and consideration should be given to accessibility and inclusivity in locations with historic surfaces. This could include ensuring that pavements to the side of cobbled streets are suitably wide and well-maintained, or clearly signposting alternative routes that avoid uneven surfaces.",

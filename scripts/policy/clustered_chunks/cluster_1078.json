    "text": "13.34 Tower Hamlets is classified as a Heat Network Priority Area (HNPA) [17], meaning that the heat density in Tower Hamlets is sufficient for heat networks to provide a feasible solution for heating buildings. Heat networks can provide a cost-effective and low carbon solution for heating in dense urban contexts, and support Tower Hamlets’ transition to a zero carbon borough. 13.35 Part 3 of this policy identifies the need for new developments to connect to heat networks. All heat sources, including ambient and waste heat and significant heat rejection, present opportunities to decarbonise the borough’s heating systems and achieve its net zero carbon emissions target. All new developments that emit waste heat must ensure on-site provision is made to future-proof an easy connection to 15 Heat and Buildings Strategy, Department of Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (2021) 16 Delivering Net Zero (2023)",

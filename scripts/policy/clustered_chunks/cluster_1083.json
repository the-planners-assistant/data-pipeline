Communal amenity space should: i. receive sunlight; ii. be adequately screened from parking areas; iii. be located so as to minimise exposure to air and noise pollution; iv. be inclusive for all users; v. be overlooked by habitable rooms to ensure safety and surveillance; vi. incorporate sustainable landscaping principles and practices; vii. be accessible to all residents of the development, irrespective of tenure; and viii. support an appropriate balance between informal social activity and play. f. Development proposals should locate play spaces at ground floor level or demonstrate why this is not practical. Development proposals that include child play space on rooftop spaces or internal floorspace should have direct access to outdoor amenity space and allow oversight of children outside from family sized homes.",

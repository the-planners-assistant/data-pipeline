    "text": "19.41 Congestion levels in many parts of the borough are severe, and the interconnectedness of the highway network – whether local or strategic – plays a significant role in contributing to this congestion. A development’s impact on congestion is not just a matter of building size but depends on its location, use, design, density, and operational factors (for instance, a relatively small development could be judged to have a severe impact if it generates a high number of vehicle trips and/or is in a sensitive location). Given the significant capacity constraints on the public transport and highway network, any development that generates a net-increase in vehicle trips has the potential to have a severe impact on the safety and operation of this network within Tower Hamlets.",

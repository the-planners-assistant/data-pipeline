    "text": "12.106 Part 4 recognises that due to higher occupancy rates and child yields, affordable housing is likely to be subject to more wear and tear than other housing tenures. In order for these homes to be fully fit for purpose, developers must use hard-wearing, durable materials to ensure the development remains of high quality throughout its lifetime and requires minimal service charges to clean and maintain. This should be evidenced in the design and access statement. For further guidance, please contact our affordable housing service and/or refer to the Tower Hamlets Housing Forumâ€™s Section 106 Design Guide. 12.107 Part 5 aims to ensure that all existing amenity space is protected. Where it would result in an improvement in quantity and/or quality of open space, re-provision will be allowed.",

Where new noise-sensitive land uses are proposed in proximity to existing noise-generating uses, the ‘Agent of Change’ principle requires the proposal for new development to robustly demonstrate how conflict with existing uses will be avoided, through mitigation measures. 26 Noise Guidance, DLUHC (2019) CLEAN AND GREEN FUTURE 3. Development proposals are required to demonstrate that the level of noise emitted from any new heating or ventilation plant will be below the background level by at least 10dBA, or comply with guidance set out in the latest version of British Standard 4142.",

    "text": "14.112 Part 1(g) should be read in conjunction with the general public art requirements in policy PS3. Research into public art in the UK has shown a severe lack of diversity, with only 2% of named statues representing ethnic minority people, and most of the statues of women that exist being fictional or allegorical representations or royal women. Statues of disabled people or members of the LGBTQ+ community are similarly rare. 14.113 The development of new public art provides an opportunity to somewhat redress this balance, as does the naming of new streets and buildings, by recognising the contributions that marginalised communities have made to the development of the east end of London and the history of our communities through direct representations or by commissioning work by women, ethnic minorities, members of the LGBTQ+ community, or disabled people to explore those stories.",

The current self-build register indicates there is interest in self-build in the borough, however high local land values and housing targets are resulting in the predominance of flatted developments which limits opportunities for viable self-build. Group self-build has the best potential to deliver significant additional housing output in higher cost areas. We would therefore encourage group self-build as a more viable model of self-build in the borough.",

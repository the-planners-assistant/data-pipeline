    "text": "BACK TO POLICIES on-site. Development proposals that include fewer than 25 student bedrooms will need to provide a cash-in-lieu contribution in accordance with the small sites affordable housing requirements set out in Policy HF2. 12.69 Part 2(b) acknowledges that there may be some sites that are proposed for purpose built student accommodation where traditional housing would not be appropriate. In those cases, the council will expect the provision of at least 50% of the rooms as affordable student accommodation. Development proposals should demonstrate that the delivery of on-site affordable C3 housing would not be appropriate and feasible. The cost should be no more than 55% of average student income for a UK full-time student living in London away from home. Planning obligations will be used to secure the affordability and availability of the affordable accommodation for as long as the student housing use continues.",

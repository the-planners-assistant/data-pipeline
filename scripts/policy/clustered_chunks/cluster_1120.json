To reflect this, part 1(a) requires all new residential developments to achieve maximum mains water use of 80 litres per person per day. This target seeks to support the growth of sustainable communities which are resilient to the impacts of water scarcity. 19 Water Stressed Area â€“ Final Classification, Environment Agency (2021) 20 Isle of Dogs and South Poplar Integrated Water Management Plan, (GLA, 2020) BACK TO POLICIES",

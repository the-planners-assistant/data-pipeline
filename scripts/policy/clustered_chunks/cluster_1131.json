    "text": "13.67 Part 4 requires major non-domestic development proposals to undertake full dynamic thermal modelling and achieve summer thermal comfort through passive strategies only in the majority of the building, according to CIBSE TM52 requirements. Exceptions can be made for small, enclosed rooms that do not have access to natural light (such as meeting rooms in offices). The CIBSE DSY1 for the 2020s, High Emissions, 50th percentile scenario for Central London should be used for the modelling. BACK TO POLICIES 13.68 For both Parts 3 and 4, where the dynamic modelling approach is followed to prove compliance with Part O, the building should also be tested under future weather conditions using the following weather files: z CIBSE 2080 Low Emissions, 50th percentile weather file for Central London to represent the 2°C GW scenario. z CIBSE 2080 High Emissions, 50th percentile weather file for Central London to represent the 4°C GW scenario.",

    "text": "14.157 Part 1(c) refers to borough designated landmarks, which are prominent buildings of high architectural and/or cultural value that can be seen in views to and from a number of places within the borough, including conservation areas. These views are referred to as borough designated views. Development should be tested against their impact on the prominence of borough designated landmarks in borough designated views. Intrusive development (as defined in the glossary) that competes with the prominence of borough-designated landmarks in the backdrop of the borough-designated views or obscures them at the mid or foreground will need to be reconsidered to reduce its intrusiveness. The council has prepared a Views and Landmarks Study that explains the significance of the borough landmarks and sets out guidance for future development within the setting of the landmarks. Proposals within these areas should demonstrate that they have taken account of this guidance.",

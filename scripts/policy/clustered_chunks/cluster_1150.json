    "text": "282 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO POLICIES 16.79 In accordance with Part 1(d), development proposals for short stay accommodation will need to submit information detailing how customers would access the accommodation - there is a general expectation that most visitors staying in hotels in Tower Hamlets will be accessing their accommodation by public transport, but taxi and other vehicle drop-off spaces may be required depending on the scale of the proposal. This would also apply to any vehicles required to service the accommodation (e.g. to handle laundry and deliver other supplies to the accommodation). 16.80 It should be demonstrated that such movements would not create unacceptable impacts on residential amenity or highway safety in accordance with Policies D.DH8 and D.TR2.",

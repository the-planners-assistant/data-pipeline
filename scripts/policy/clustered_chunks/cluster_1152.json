Within Tower Hamlets, certain locations may have intangible cultural value for particular sections of the community. The initial process of consultation and engagement with the community around the design and development of sites should help to identify where significance exists, and to identify the elements of a site that the local community considers to be of heritage value. This further highlights the importance of that engagement taking place at the earliest possible stage to inform the design response.",

In order to better serve those who do not have access to shops and services during normal business hours, Part 3 encourages late-opening and 24-hour shops and services in TOWN CENTRES the borough’s town centres, and in particular those centres with large concentrations of night workers, such as Whitechapel City and Brick Lane. 16.73 Part 4 recognises that the London Plan has established the ‘Agent of Change’ principle, whereby it will be the responsibility of a new development to sufficiently mitigate any impact existing uses might have on its occupiers. In the case of development in town centres with a significant night-time economy, new residential development will be required to provide sufficient soundproofing and to be oriented in a way to ensure that residents do not experience unreasonable levels of noise from night-time uses.

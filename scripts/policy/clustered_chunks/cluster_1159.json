    "text": "infrastructure, including the delivery of Fibre To The Premises (FTTP) (also called full fibre gigabit broadband), existing 4G and 5G mobile telecoms and future wireless technologies including 6G, to be essential infrastructure to support the delivery of sustainable development. Part R1 of the Building Regulations 2010 requires buildings to be equipped with at least 30 MB/s ready in-building physical infrastructure, however new developments using full fibre to the property or other higher-grade infrastructure can achieve connectivity speeds of 1GB/s. Developers should engage early with a range of network operators, to ensure that development proposals are designed to be capable of providing this level of connectivity to all end users. Mechanisms should also be put in place to enable further future infrastructure upgrades. Innovation is driving reductions in the size of infrastructure, with marginal additional unit costs, but greater digital connectivity is needed in more locations.",

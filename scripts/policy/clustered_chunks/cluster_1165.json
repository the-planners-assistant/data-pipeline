    "text": "13.127 As per Part 4, where it is demonstrated that measures to improve air quality cannot be delivered on site, an offsetting contribution may be agreed with the council in the form of a cash-in-lieu payment, to deliver the air quality improvement measures offsite. The method for calculating the offset payment is set out in Section 5 of the Air Quality Neutral LPG. 13.128 Part 5 requires new private, communal, publicly accessible open space, and child play spaces that are proposed in areas of substandard air quality to demonstrate that the positioning and design has been considered to minimise the exposure of future users, particularly vulnerable users, to air pollution. The recommended distance within the AQAP is 50 meters from the pollution source.",

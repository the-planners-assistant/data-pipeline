In instances of less than substantial harm to a designated heritage asset, the test in part 4 should be applied. 198 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO POLICIES 14.133 Part 5 emphasises that non-designated heritage assets should also be considered as part of development proposals, and proposals should aim to conserve or enhance these assets as well. Early engagement with planning officers is encouraged to help identify nondesignated heritage assets. When considering applications that affect non-designated heritage assets (either directly or indirectly), the council will have regard to the scale of any harm or loss, and the significance of the heritage asset when making a planning decision.",

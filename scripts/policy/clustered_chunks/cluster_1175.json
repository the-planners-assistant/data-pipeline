Viability evidence finds there is no need to apply the vacant building credit mechanism in the borough to ‘kick start’ development (Tower Hamlets Local Plan Viability Assessment 2017). In addition, the effect of the vacant building credit will be to reduce affordable housing contributions and this is contrary to our need to deliver affordable housing through the planning system. The Affordable Housing and Viability Supplementary Planning Guidance (GLA, 2017) sets out the extent to which vacant building credit should be applied in London and concludes that its application is unlikely to be suitable in London.

    "text": "11.33 Part 1 sets out how the council expects developers to sign up to the Tower Hamlets Code of Construction Practice (CoCP) and a constructors’ forum (where appropriate) to better manage and mitigate the cumulative impacts arising from construction on the borough’s key development sites. The Tower Hamlets CoCP seeks to set out simply and clearly what constitutes acceptable site practice within the borough. It is intended to help developers, architects, engineers and construction professionals to plan, cost and manage the environmental mitigation required to protect the health, safety and well-being of our residents and businesses. 11.34 Part 2 ensures that there is ongoing communication and regular updates, at each phase of delivery, by those responsible for the development’s delivery to the council. This aids the facilitation of development coordination.",

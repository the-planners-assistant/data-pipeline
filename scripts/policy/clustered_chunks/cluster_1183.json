    "text": "14.72 Part 1(n) seeks to ensure that the design of new development optimises the levels of daylight and sunlight. Part 1(o) seeks to ensure that new developments minimise the impact of the loss of daylight and sunlight and unacceptable overshadowing (including on amenity space and public open space). A sunlight and daylight assessment must accompany all major planning applications and smaller schemes where adverse effects on daylight and sunlight levels are anticipated. It should follow the methodology set out in the most recent version of Building Research Establishmentâ€™s Site Layout Planning for Daylight and Sunlight guidance and the British Standard Code of Practice for daylighting, the results of which must be submitted with the planning application. Daylight and sunlight assessments should also include consideration of the potential redevelopment of adjacent sites, so as not to prejudice their redevelopment.",

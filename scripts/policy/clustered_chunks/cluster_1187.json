    "text": "14.95 The NPPF encourages new streets to be tree-lined, and this policy asks for new streets to incorporate trees where possible and to also include other forms of urban greening. This is an important component of creating healthy urban environments and can also help to ensure that developments meet requirements elsewhere in this Local Plan for biodiversity improvements and urban greening. Planting strategies should be discussed with biodiversity and tree officers from the council at an early stage to ensure that the selected species are appropriate and can be adequately maintained. Non-native trees may not be appropriate close to sensitive habitats due to the potential for negative ecological impacts.",

    "text": "11.87 Part 1(e) explains that for publicly accessible open space to count as strategic infrastructure (and therefore to meet the requirements of site allocations that include open space as required infrastructure, and to potentially be liable for CIL-in-kind), it must consist of at least 1 hectare of contiguous open space. Smaller, non-contiguous open spaces, even where they add up to a total of 1 hectare across a site, will only be considered to meet local needs for open space, not strategic needs. This applies even where such spaces are claimed to be connected via green routes or pedestrianised pathways. All publicly accessible open space should be additional to other open space requirements in the Local Plan, such as communal amenity space and play space requirements – spaces that are counted towards the required total of communal amenity space or children’s play space Tower Hamlets Local Plan 71 DELIVERING THE LOCAL PLAN",

    "text": "throughout the policies in the plan to help embed greater inclusivity in all development proposals. 14.105 Part 1(a) concerns routes, wayfinding, and connectivity. In line with policy PS4, sites should be connected, permeable, and legible â€“ there should be multiple ways to get to destinations and development should be designed, laid out, and incorporate wayfinding in such a way that it is clear to a passerby which are the main routes through the sites, and which are more likely to be of interest only to residents. Consideration should be given to how routes may feel different in the daytime and the nighttime, and to how wayfinding measures clearly identify better lit and more populated routes at nighttime. Regular and visible naming of different areas within the development can also make it easier for people who need to call for help to describe where they are, and can help to make a place feel like a part of the public realm rather than a private space aimed only at residents.",

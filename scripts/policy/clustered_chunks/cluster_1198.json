    "text": "290 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO POLICIES Analysis of market rents for comparative uses in the area should be provided in order to demonstrate the affordability of the re-provided facility. The development proposal must include the reprovision of a sufficient fit out for the successful operation of the facility as agreed with the existing operator. Where practicable, the replacement facility should be provided before the existing facility ceases operation to ensure that local people continue to receive a high-quality service. However, where maintaining no break in provision of the facility on site is not possible, a local decant strategy should be put in place, with the developer and not the community facility operator meeting the costs of this, agreed via a planning obligation.",

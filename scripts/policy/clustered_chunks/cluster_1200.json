    "text": "18.84 Part 3 requires major developments to submit an ecology assessment. The ecology assessment should include: (a) information assessing the characteristics and situation of the site, and (b) details on how the proposals will protect or replace, and enhance existing biodiversity on the proposed site, including measures for wildlife habitats and features aimed at particular species. 18.85 Applications should also detail how recommendations are being included in the development proposals. Should the ecology assessment indicate an adverse impact on the biodiversity interest of the site, this will be managed using the hierarchical approach set out in part 5. Should compensation be sought, it would be at the level required to adequately offset the impact on the SINC or protected/priority species, through the provision of an alternative site or habitat.",

The degree of overlooking depends on the distance and the horizontal and vertical angles of view. However, a distance of approximately 18 metres between windows of habitable rooms reduces inter-visibility to a degree acceptable to most people. This figure will be applied as a guideline depending upon the design and layout of the development.",

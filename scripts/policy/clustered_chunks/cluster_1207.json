This can assist in making women and other vulnerable users of streets feel safe and able to use streets throughout the day and into the evening and nighttime to create busy, intergenerational, connected places. Building entrances (including subordinate entrances such as back or side doors) should be well-lit and easily visible, avoiding narrow or concealed entranceways.",

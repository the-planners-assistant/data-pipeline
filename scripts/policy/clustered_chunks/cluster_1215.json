    "text": "14.28 Part 3 requires all tall building proposals, even when they are located within areas that have been identified as potentially suitable for tall buildings, to demonstrate how they provide significant public benefits to justify their development. Tall buildings and increased densities can be positive things, but they are not inherently so â€“ they have to be accompanied by the public benefits that denser, taller buildings can unlock. The design criteria in this policy set out the circumstances in which tall buildings will be considered acceptable from a design perspective, but to be considered acceptable in the overall planning balance, where the potential negative impacts of taller buildings are considered against the benefits they bring, they must provide a significant proportion of the affordable housing that the borough so urgently needs. To that end, to be considered acceptable, tall building proposals must meet or exceed the 40% affordable housing",

New development will reduce the severance resulting from The Highway, Mile End Road and Commercial Road, the waterways and railway lines, and provide public realm improvements. Improved cycling and walking routes will increase local accessibility and access to strategic cycle routes and transport interchanges. 23.5 Employment in the area will remain primarily local and smallscale focused in town centres and transport hubs, including Bethnal Green, Mile End and Limehouse.

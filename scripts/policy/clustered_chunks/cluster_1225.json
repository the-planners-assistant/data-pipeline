    "text": "66 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO POLICIES Supporting text 11.68 This policy seeks to ensure that new homes and developments in Tower Hamlets are supported with sufficient utilities and service infrastructure, and new developments have access to clean energy, heat, water and sewerage, mobile connectivity and fast broadband connections. Recent studies undertaken by the Tower Hamlets Infrastructure Delivery Coordination Pilots Programme (IDCPP) have found that the traditional methods of utility and services procurement are not an efficient solution with which to support new growth and development, including the decarbonisation of our energy and transport systems. Although progress has been made on improving the energy and water efficiency of new developments to better manage utilities demand, additional connections to utilities and services are still required.",

    "text": "14.29 This policy sets out appropriate heights for tall buildings across the borough. However, precise heights will still need to be considered on a site-by-site basis, and each proposal will be assessed on its own merits â€“ in some places within a Tall Building Zone it may be possible to build up to the highest appropriate height, but in other places a lower height may be required for a number of reasons (including, but not limited to, PEOPLE, PLACES AND SPACES elements such as microclimate, daylight/sunlight impacts, heritage impacts, and townscape impacts). 14.30 In all cases, the height that is proposed on a particular site should be the one that is demonstrated by a design-led process to be the most appropriate for the context. Part 4 of this policy sets out the criteria that should be considered when determining height on particular sites. Proposals should also consider the specific tall building zone principles in part 6 of the policy.",

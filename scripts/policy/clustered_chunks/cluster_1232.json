    "text": "13.26 Part 3 requires development proposals to meet a space heating demand of 15 kWh/m2 GIA/yr or less. [14] This figure applies to all domestic and non-domestic building types. Space heating demand is the amount of heat energy needed to heat a building over a year, and is a measure of the thermal efficiency of a building. Space heating demand is influenced by a number of design and specification decisions, including building form and orientation, insulation, airtightness, windows and doors, and the type of ventilation system used. Buildings with a low space heating demand are more thermally efficient and lose heat slowly. This makes it easier to maximise the contribution from renewable energy sources and will result in lower heating and energy costs for residents and businesses. 14 ‘UK housing – fit for the future?’ Climate Change Committee (2019) CLEAN AND GREEN FUTURE",

    "text": "avoided. 14.36 The choice of facing materials is important to assist in visually weaving a new building into its established surroundings or, where appropriate, provide a contrast. Design should draw on local character and distinctiveness when selecting materials and help reinforce the identity and sense of place within an area. The choice of materials needs to be carefully tested through 3D modelling and visualisations to fully understand their impact. Consideration should be given as to how design detailing is perceived from close up, and middle and long distance views. Materials should be durable and offer longevity, and should be fully justified in relation to the typical palette of materials and colours used in its location. Bright colours and tones that are visually prominent should generally be avoided on tall buildings, particularly within the setting of sensitive heritage assets or when visible in sensitive views.",

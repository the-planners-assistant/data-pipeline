    "text": "framework). 11.19 Part 7 sets out that social value refers to a broader concept of value beyond just monetary contribution. It focuses on people and contribution to the community, assessing the positive value created for the local economy, improvements in social well-being, and enhancements to protect the local environment. There is a precedent for considering social value as a key factor in procuring contracts after the passing of the Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012. When applied to development, social value looks at the wider social contribution a development creates for society across its whole lifecycle, from how it is constructed to how it is managed, considering its direct and indirect impacts. This is in-line with Part 2 of the NPPF ‘Achieving Sustainable Development’, which outlines the three objectives of the planning system: to promote economic well-being, improve social progress, and protect and enhance our natural and built environment.",

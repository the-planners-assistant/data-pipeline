Notwithstanding other policies in this plan, the council will support development proposals that meet either the water neutrality standard or the requirements to achieve a Thames Water Tier 3 Infrastructure Charge discount. 13.109 Part 4 requires all new major development proposals to install “dual plumbing” (potable and non-potable pipework systems as well as separate rain, grey and foul water collection) and to design for the installation of rainwater harvesting and grey water re-use systems, to provide improved future resilience. Dual plumbing will allow buildings to be connected to sources of reused water as they are developed in the future, supporting the development of a market for reused water.",

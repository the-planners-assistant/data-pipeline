Furthermore, new basements must be protected from sewer flooding through the installation of a suitable (positively) pumped device. This is only applicable where there is a waste outlet from the basement, ie, where the basement includes toilets, bathrooms, utility rooms, etc. Applicants should show the location of the device on the drawings submitted with the planning application.

    "text": "186 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO POLICIES Supporting text 14.98 This policy encourages all new development to consider inclusive design as part of the development process. This policy is based upon a gender-inclusive design evidence base document that has been prepared by the council, and a disability-focused local plan consultation workshop held with the disabled peopleâ€™s organization Real at Regulation 18 consultation stage. Evidence from the UN, the World Bank, and the GLA shows that if the needs of women and girls are considered and shape the development of the urban environment, outcomes will be more welcoming and work better for all. Therefore, designing with women and girls creates better places. Our own research with women and girls, disability and LGTBQ+ groups shows that meeting the needs of women and girls also helps to meet the needs of minority and marginalised groups.",

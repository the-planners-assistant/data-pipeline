    "text": "11.77 Part 2 of this policy identifies the need for new developments to connect to heat networks. All heat sources, including ambient and waste heat and significant heat rejection, present opportunities to decarbonise the boroughâ€™s heating systems and achieve its net zero carbon emissions target. All new developments that emit waste heat must ensure on-site provision is made to future-proof an easy connection to future heat networks. This includes the provision of heat exchangers, thermal stores, pipework connections at the site boundary, and heat supply agreements to heat network operators. Heat network operators supplying to residential properties shall be registered participants in the Heat Trust scheme and each heat network shall be a Heat Trust registered scheme. Where existing heat networks have not decarbonized, sleeving shall be applied for the connection of new development.",

    "text": "Tower Hamlets Local Plan 23 INTRODUCTIONSETTING THE SCENE BACK TO CONTENTS Built form 8.22 Tower Hamlets is made up of 24 places, each containing unique characteristics that shape and define the borough and that have coalesced over time. Much of the borough has been developed at a modest scale with many neighbourhoods composed of streets of terraced properties dating from the 19th century. Located alongside the River Thames, the economy of much of the borough depended on this watercourse and thriving docks characterised the area until the middle of the last century. The decline of the docks has brought significant change and regeneration to the borough. The former docklands have changed from largely working environments to provide new residential neighbourhoods for the borough’s growing community. Many have been developed at high densities and including clusters of tall buildings that have transformed the borough’s skyline.",

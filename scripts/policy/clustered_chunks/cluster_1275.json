Large-scale development proposals, and major development within Air Quality Focus Areas should achieve ‘air quality positive’ standards, in line with the Air Quality Positive LPG (2023). All other development proposals are required to meet or exceed the ‘air quality neutral’ standard. 2. An air quality impact assessment, based on current best practice, is required as part of the planning application for: a. major developments proposals; b. developments which will require substantial earthworks, or partial or complete demolition; c. developments which include education and health facilities or open space (including child play space); d. new build developments in areas of sub-standard air quality (as designated and shown on the Policies Map).",

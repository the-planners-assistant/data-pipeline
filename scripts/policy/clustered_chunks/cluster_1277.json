    "text": "End. 16.45 It is widely recognised that markets act as magnets to create interest and draw people into town centres and support footfall which benefits other businesses. They can also act as incubation space for new ideas and small-to-medium enterprises. This policy aims to protect the boroughâ€™s existing markets and ensure that new development does not undermine their future role and function (e.g. ensuring that storage facilities are maintained). 16.46 Part 1 of this policy refers to the protection of our existing street markets at Bethnal Green, Brick Lane, Chrisp Street, Columbia Road, Petticoat Lane, Roman Road, Roman Road Square, Stroudley Walk, Watney Street and Whitechapel City, as well as the Spitalfields covered market.",

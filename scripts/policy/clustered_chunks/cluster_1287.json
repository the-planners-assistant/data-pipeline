Where co-location is not possible, the report should clearly set out the efforts that have been taken, and the reasons why co-location is not feasible. 14.182 Part 2 aims to ensure that the installation of telecommunications equipment does not conflict with the general design, streetscape, and heritage requirements of other policies in this section of the Local Plan.",

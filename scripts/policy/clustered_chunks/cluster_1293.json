    "text": "to local residents and communities. 12 Tower Hamlets Net Zero Carbon Plan (2020) Pg 31 13 Delivering Net Zero (2023) BACK TO POLICIES 13.20 Part 2 of this policy requires proposals to demonstrated that energy usage has been minimised, by meeting specific Energy Usage Intensity (EUI) target for domestic and non-domestic buildings. The EUI represents the total amount of energy used by a building divided by its floor area (based on gross internal area, or GIA). It is reported in kWh/m2 year, and includes both regulated and unregulated energy use. Energy generated by on or off-site renewables does not affect the EUI value. 13.21 The EUI targets set out in this policy are supported by detailed energy modelling as part of the Delivering Net Zero study (2023), which modelled the predictive energy usage of eight building typologies, four domestic and four non-domestic, to identify best-practice targets for low energy-use.",

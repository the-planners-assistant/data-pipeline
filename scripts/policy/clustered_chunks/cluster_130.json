These should align with the existing urban grain to support legibility, particularly joining Knapp Road to Bow Common Lane, which should also see improvements to the green grid delivered. Good quality onward connections to the green grid routes along the railway arches and through the cemetery park should also be provided. z Integrate the site with Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park through new or improved pedestrian and cycle routes. z Ensure safe pedestrian and cycling access to the sixth form centre. Environment and public realm z Improve public realm with active site edges, particularly along Bow Common Lane. z Provide active frontages along the railway to enhance the use and setting of the railway arches as a non-designated heritage asset. z Implement noise screening measures/or a green buffer in areas",

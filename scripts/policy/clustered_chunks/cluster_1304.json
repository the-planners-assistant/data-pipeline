    "text": "14.7 This policy aims to ensure that new development is well-designed and proposes sustainable capacities and densities to create high-quality places for our residents to live. It incorporates the requirements of the new London Plan for all sites to optimise their capacity through a designled process. This will help to ensure that new development creates attractive, liveable places that existing and future residents are proud to live in. The London Plan Guidance on Optimising Site Capacity makes clear that optimising site capacity does not mean maximising the density of a site. Instead, it means “responding to the existing character and distinctiveness of the surrounding context and balancing the capacity for growth, need for increased housing supply, and key factors such as access by walking, cycling and public transport, alongside an improved quality of life for Londoners. Capacity-testing should be the product of the design-led approach, and not the driver” (paragraph 1.1.1.).",

For reasons of efficiency, the site allocations do not set out standard requirements relating to issues like the delivery of affordable housing, biodiversity improvements, the improvement of air quality, or many other topics covered in the local plan policies â€“ these requirements should be assumed to apply unless the site allocation text specifies that they do not.",

However, this needs to be done carefully to ensure that heritage assets are not damaged in a way that is contrary to the rest of the policy, and so in some instances a balance may need to be struck between the need to improve energy efficiency and the protection of heritage. Retrofitting of heritage assets should take a non- or minimally-invasive approach, and this may require that bespoke and non-standard approaches to energy efficiency are BACK TO POLICIES taken. Regard should be had to Historic England’s advice note on Energy Efficiency and Traditional Homes. 14.143 Where necessary, the council will consider using legal powers to ensure that essential maintenance of designated heritage assets is undertaken.",

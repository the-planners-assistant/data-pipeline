    "text": "11.59 Part 2(a) requires the social value contribution of a development proposal to be proportional to the scale of development. The social value strategy should demonstrate this and should be introduced as early as possible, so that the consideration of social value can meaningfully influence proposals. Therefore, it is strongly encouraged that the strategy is considered at pre-application stage, should the applicant seek that service. At the design/ pre-application stage it is expected that the social value strategy will be of a higher level, setting out social value goals and identifying when these will be delivered throughout the lifecycle of the scheme. Subsequently, prior to commencement, it is expected that the social value strategy will have been refined and developed in more detail, setting out the social value outcomes that will be delivered by the development.

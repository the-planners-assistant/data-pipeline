    "text": "London Plan. 18.15 Part 1 (c) seeks to ensure that strategic development proposals provide proportional contributions to the boroughâ€™s network of publicly accessible open space. Such developments will have an impact on the capacity of existing open spaces and must therefore ensure that an increase can reduce the pressure on those spaces. The publicly accessible open space should aim to meet the local standard of 1.2 hectares per 1000 residents (as identified in the Open Space Strategy). BIODIVERSITY AND OPEN SPACE 18.16 Certain site allocations (as specified within Section 4 of the plan) will be required to provide a minimum of 1 hectare consolidated open space in order to meet wider strategic needs. Part 2 of policy BO2 (Open spaces and the Green Grid network)outlines the quality and standards required for new and enhanced open space provision.",

Proposals should also detail how the types of goods and services proposed would complement rather than compete with surrounding town centres, as well as how they could contribute to other priorities such as improving access to healthy, affordable food. In addition, a written management and design strategy should be provided which outlines how the proposal will avoid causing negative impacts on markets, such as congestion on footpaths and roads, litter, poor refuse storage and noise.

    "text": "12.99 Part 1(a) and (b) seeks to ensure all housing development provides adequate internal space to meet relevant space, accessibility and amenity standards and provide an appropriate living environment. It requires development to comply, as a minimum, with the space and accessibility standards set out in the London Plan (GLA, 2021), the Housing Design Standards London Plan Guidance (GLA, 2023) and the Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016), whilst having regard to the particular needs of residents in the borough as well as the increasingly dense character of the built form. If the GLAâ€™s space and accessibility standards are updated, the council may seek to implement these changes, so long as they are locally suitable. The council strongly urges developers/applicants to provide evidence of how the scheme will achieve high-quality design.",

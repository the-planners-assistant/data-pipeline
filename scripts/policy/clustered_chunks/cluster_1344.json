    "text": "18.21 The consolidation of open spaces increases their recreational and biodiversity values. Once the total area of new open space provided across development sites reaches 1ha, this can lead to a reduction in deficiency in access to open space. Locating public realm adjacent to water spaces also expands visual amenity, which is important for general well-being. To ensure new developments achieve these outcomes, development proposals must locate new open space in a manner that enables their expansion â€“ either by situating them next to existing open space on adjacent sites, or in a location where further pieces of open space may be delivered on adjacent sites in future.",

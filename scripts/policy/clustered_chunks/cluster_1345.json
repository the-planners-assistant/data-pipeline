In addition, LBTH faces considerable challenges in delivering homes which are affordable to local people on average incomes, who are unable to access social housing or afford market housing, particularly if they have children [3] . 12.23 Part 1 sets a strategic target of achieving 50% affordable homes through private development, developments by Registered Providers, the third sector, community led projects, as well as council-led initiatives. This target is considered to best reflect local housing need as evidenced in the Local Housing Need Assessment and the Housing with Care Strategy.",

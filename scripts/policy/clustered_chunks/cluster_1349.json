This is to ensure that larger nighttime businesses can benefit from existing infrastructure and so that businesses can contribute to the vitality and viability of the centres at night, while limiting their impact on the amenity of other users. The development of night-time uses is addressed in more detail in Policy T7. 16.23 In accordance with Policy EG3, development proposals that include at least 1000sqm of commercial floorspace are expected to provide affordable commercial floorspace. More details can be found in Policy EG3. Where sites are located within town centres, the council may seek the provision of affordable retail or other public-facing commercial space.

London has four world heritage sites, one of which is within Tower Hamlets (the Tower of London), and one of which is just across the river Thames in Greenwich, and with a buffer zone that extends into Tower Hamlets (Maritime Greenwich). 14.146 The Tower of London, one of the UKâ€™s most famous landmarks and tourist attractions, is a Grade I listed castle and royal fortress, which acts as the gateway into the borough from the west. Indeed, the borough is named after the villages and hamlets around the Tower of London. However, many of the streets and spaces in and around this area are dominated by vehicles/heavy traffic and offer a poor public realm and interchange experience from Tower Hill and Tower Gateway stations. These issues are also identified within the Tower of London World Heritage Site Management Plan. BACK TO POLICIES",

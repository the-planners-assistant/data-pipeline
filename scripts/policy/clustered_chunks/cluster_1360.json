    "text": "19.83 Part 3(d) requires development to minimise the number of daily vehicle trips to and from the site. by consolidating and coordinating deliveries and servicing. Residential development will require bespoke management and delivery accommodation when compared to commercial development. The rapid acceleration of internet shopping has resulted in a significant growth of smaller light goods vehicles, which increase congestion and pollution at peak times as well as traditionally quieter times. Delivery vehicles to residential addresses often park on the highway causing traffic flow and safety concerns. This disruption increases with missed deliveries whereby the same address receives a second or third delivery attempt. Development should provide space for these deliveries and help ensure all such deliveries are completed on the first attempt.",

    "text": "150 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO POLICIES Supporting text 14.6 Tower Hamlets is a small borough in geographical terms, so opportunities for development are limited. Thus, to meet our ambitious targets for good-quality housing, to address overcrowding, and to enable sustainable placemaking, an increase in density is generally supported across the borough. But this increase in density needs to have high-quality design as a key focus with the boroughâ€™s housing needs in mind, and needs to be proportionate to the capacity of the borough to absorb the increase in terms of infrastructure (both social and physical) and the creation of positive places through elements such as townscape and multi-functional public realm in order to deliver successful and sustainable places.",

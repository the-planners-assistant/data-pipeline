    "text": "the tallest buildings within the zones should form clusters around rail transport stations or be located within town centres, where the higher level of accessibility to public transports, shops, and services can better accommodate higher densities. The threshold of 70m has been selected as this is the definition of a tall building in the City of London, which is adjacent to Tower Hamlets. By limiting heights to this level, we can gradually and sustainably increase the density of Tower Hamlets while respecting the context of heights in the City. Locating taller buildings in these areas can aid legibility, helping people find their way to town centres and transport hubs.",

The affordable housing will need to meet the housing standards set out in Policy HF9. 12.85 In accordance with part 3(a), development proposals must provide a minimum of 10% of dwellings as wheelchair accessible units. Given the nature of LSPBSL developments, the communal amenities must also be designed to be wheelchair accessible, including kitchens, laundry rooms, lounges, and external amenity space. 12.86 To meet the requirements of parts 3(b) and (c), development proposals should have regard to Policy HF9. 12.87 Communal amenity space should be generously sized and high quality and should be located within the site in such a way that it minimises exposure to noise and air pollution. A portion of the amenity space should be provided at ground level to ensure there is space useable by those who may not be comfortable using a rooftop space.",

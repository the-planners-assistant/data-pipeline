Part 2(a) recognises the high level of need for traditional affordable housing in the borough and that student housing developments may occupy land that could otherwise be used for the delivery of traditional housing. If the development proposal includes the provision of affordable C3 housing, we will apply the requirements of Policy HF2 in terms of tenure mix and unit size mix. In accordance with the London Plan, development proposals for student housing are assessed on the basis that 2.5 student bedrooms are equivalent to 1 standard C3 dwelling. On that basis, development proposals that include 25 or more student bedrooms are considered major development and will be expected to provide affordable housing BACK TO POLICIES",

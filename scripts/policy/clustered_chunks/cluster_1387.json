    "text": "250 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO POLICIES 15.83 As data centres have high electricity demands and can monopolise capacity in the local supply, placing a limit on the amount of residential development that can be accommodated in an area, Part 1(c) sets requirements on how to manage this resource better / effectively. Capacity should be proven at primary substation, distribution, grid supply point and transmission level, as applicable. It requires development proposals for data centres to engage with electricity suppliers and receive confirmation from those suppliers that the electricity requirements of the proposed data centre can be accommodated without limiting electricity supply such that it would prevent delays to other types of development being delivered in the area.",

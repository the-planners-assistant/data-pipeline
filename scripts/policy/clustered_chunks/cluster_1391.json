These are areas which also offer access to public transport with high PTAL scores. HOMES FOR THE COMMUNITY 12.80 Part 1(e) reflects that given the high density nature of LSPBSL, they can have particular impacts on their surrounding communities in terms of noise, privacy, and stress on existing infrastructure. To ensure that LSPBSL does not have a negative impact on the amenity of an existing community, development proposals will be required to provide an assessment of the potential impacts of the proposal, and the cumulative impacts of the proposal alongside other consented development in the surrounding area, on neighbouring amenity, and any measures necessary to mitigate these impacts.",

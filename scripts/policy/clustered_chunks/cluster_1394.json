    "text": "13.47 Part 1 requires all major development proposals to undertake a Whole Life Carbon assessment (WLCA). This requires applicants to calculate operational and embodied carbon emissions and demonstrate how they can be reduced as part of the WLCA. Requiring all major development proposals, not just referable schemes, to undertake a WLCA will help to support the Tower Hamlets’ 2045 net zero carbon borough targets, as the construction and development comprises a significant portion of the borough’s carbon emissions. It will also drive resource efficiency and adoption of circular economy principles, by encouraging refurbishment, retention, and reuse of existing materials and buildings before demolition and new construction. Applicants may undertake the required Whole Life Carbon reporting using the templates provided by either the London Plan Guidance or the updated RICS Professional Statement. CLEAN AND GREEN FUTURE",

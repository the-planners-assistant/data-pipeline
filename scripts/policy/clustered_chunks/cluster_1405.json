    "text": "Supporting text 14.78 As Tower Hamlets has some of the highest population densities in London, the quality of streets and spaces is important to maintain and create a high quality of life. This policy aims to deliver an attractive, legible, accessible, and well-designed network of streets and spaces which promote social interaction and inclusion which people of all ages and abilities can value and enjoy, and where they feel safe and comfortable. The public realm in the borough varies considerably, from the high-quality treatments around Canary Wharf (e.g. natural stone paving and tree planting) and conservation areas, through to the isolated, post-war streetscapes beyond Canary Wharf and Aldgate, as well as the severance arising from major arterial routes, such as Aspen Way and The Highway, around Bow, Poplar, Limehouse and the Tower of London. New development should always aim to provide a public realm which is an improvement on what was there before.",

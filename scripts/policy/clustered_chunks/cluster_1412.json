Using a reasonable cost rate for a high output PV system with micro-inverters (i.e. £1,016/kWp) and applying a 10% additional rate for administering and managing the PV funding process, would give an energy offset price of £1.32/kWh/yr. 13.44 The energy offset contribution = Energy Gap (kWh) x £1.32/ kWh and will be secured via planning obligation. The energy offset contribution is based on calculations from the Delivering Net Zero report (2023). The offset cost calculation may be updated as required, reflecting the varying costs of energy and project delivery.

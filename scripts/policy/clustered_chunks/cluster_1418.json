Neighbouring areas across the river include Lewisham, Southwark, and the Royal Borough of Greenwich. Tower Hamlets is renowned for its diversity and multiculturalism, with a vibrant cultural scene and numerous historical landmarks, including the iconic Tower of London and Tower Bridge. 8.5 Part of the borough (Fish Island, Hackney Wick, and Bromley-byBow) currently falls within the boundary of the LLDC, the local planning authority responsible for coordinating the growth and regeneration of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and surrounding areas as part of the 2012 London Olympic Games legacy. The planning powers for this area will be passed back to LBTH by the end of 2024.",

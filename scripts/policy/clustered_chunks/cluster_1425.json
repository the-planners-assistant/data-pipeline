Tower Hamlets Local Plan 207 PEOPLE, PLACES AND SPACES 14.159 Part 1(e) recognises that water space and open space are intrinsic elements of the boroughâ€™s identity and that their presence is an essential element of the character of a place. Development should therefore avoid severing visual connections between the existing public realm and water or open spaces; and should aim to provide enhanced visual connections to water or open spaces through the layout and design of the development. Developments located adjacent to water or open spaces, or on streets in their direct vicinity which are parallel and perpendicular to them, should afford views and glimpses of these sites from the street level.",

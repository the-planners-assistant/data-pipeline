This agreement is known as a nomination agreement and must cover the development as long as it is used for student accommodation. A nomination agreement with one or more higher education providers must cover at least 50% of the bedrooms within the development, and all of the affordable student bedrooms. For the remainder of the student bedrooms, development proposals must demonstrate that best endeavours have been taken to secure nomination agreements with higher education institutions, including demonstrating that, in the first instance, all local higher education institutions have been approached",

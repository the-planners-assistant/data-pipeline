Delivering an alignment in embodied carbon measurement is an important interim step towards developing net zero carbon targets that reflect the UKâ€™s carbon budget. To address the issue of misaligned targets, LETI have identified best practice targets for upfront embodied carbon, which refers to the initial amount of embodied carbon associated with the building (Building Life Cycle Stages A1-A5 excluding sequestration).",

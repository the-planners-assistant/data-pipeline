Provide safe pedestrian and cycling access to the secondary school. Development must provide public access along the waterfront at the River Lea. Improvements to green grid routes should be delivered through the site and along the River Lea waterfront, with good onward connections provided to green grid routes at Oban Street and Abbott Road, and to the Aberfeldy Estate and Blackwall Trading Estate site allocations. z Development should provide appropriate riparian lifesaving infrastructure along the riverside path. Environment and public realm z Development should step back from the River Lea to avoid excessive overshadowing and enable activation of the riverside.",

Necessary items required to mitigate the impact of development such as affordable housing, may be secured through Section 106 obligations. 11.47 The MCIL will help fund strategic transport projects. We collect these receipts from developments in Tower Hamlets and pass them onto Transport for London (TfL). Developments in the borough may be liable for both the Mayoral and borough-wide CIL.

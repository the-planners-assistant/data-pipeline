This is to ensure that the accommodation provided will serve the need of students seeking education at providers within London. Proposals should also demonstrate that the bedrooms in the purpose-built student accommodation development are needed by London’s HEIs in that particular location, and that its design, layout, and rental levels meet the needs of London’s higher education students. Higher Education Institutes should be involved in the early design process of the Purpose-built student accommodation.",

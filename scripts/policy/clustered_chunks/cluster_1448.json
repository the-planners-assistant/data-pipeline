Air quality modelling indicates that the most polluting areas in the borough are along arterial roads. In these areas of sub-standard air quality, nitrogen dioxide levels exceed national air quality objectives, and particulate matter exceed annual mean limits – BACK TO POLICIES (PM2.5 levels greater than 10 μg/ m3 (WHO 2005 air quality guideline (AQG) limits) and PM10 levels greater than 40 μg/ m3 (national objective limits). There are no safe levels of air pollution exposure, and health risks associated with particulate matters are a significant cause for concern. The Tower Hamlets AQAP outlines the mitigation measures to reduce people’s exposure to air pollution and identifies the ways in which development can improve air quality in the borough. 108 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO POLICIES Policy CG2 Low energy buildings",

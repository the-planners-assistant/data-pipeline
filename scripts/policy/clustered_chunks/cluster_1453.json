More guidance regarding the design of communal amenity space can be found in the High Density Living SPD. In regeneration schemes it is recommended that input is sought from existing residents on the design of communal amenity spaces. 12.113 Part 6(f) recognises that ground floor space is preferable for the provision of child play space and that some residents and parents may be anxious using a rooftop space. In the first instance development proposals should seek to deliver child play space at ground floor level and where this is not possible robustly demonstrate why it is not achievable.

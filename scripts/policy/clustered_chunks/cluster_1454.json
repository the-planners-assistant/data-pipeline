Part 3 of the policy sets out that the council may, where it is considered appropriate and necessary, require the use of planning conditions or planning obligations to ensure that design quality is carried through into the detailed design and construction of the development in accordance with London Plan Policy D4. This may include architect retention clauses or requirements for design certification. Providing the maximum possible level of design detail at application stage can reduce the need for later design amendments that could negatively affect development quality. 178 Tower Hamlets Local Plan",

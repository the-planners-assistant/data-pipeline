This Tower Hamlets Local Plan 187 PEOPLE, PLACES AND SPACES has included on-street interviews with women and girls across the borough, workshops with community organisations, online ‘walks’ around the borough to discuss safety concerns, and detailed surveys and questionnaires. Over 400 women and girls participated in this research and by listening to their lived experience of the borough we have developed a series of recommendations that suggest new approaches to development and the way development is planned and delivered, from a high level approach to specific fine grain recommendations to improve streets, public spaces and building exteriors (such as entrance ways and exits).",

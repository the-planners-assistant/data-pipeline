Where new provision is proposed, it must be located in the most viable locations to support the role and function of the boroughâ€™s designated employment locations and to proactively avoid long-term vacancy or subsequent conversion to other uses. This policy seeks to direct new provision to the designated employment locations, activity areas and site allocations which include employment space as a first priority, then to locations of highest activity, accessibility and visibility (see Part 3) and finally to other locations (see Part 4) where it meets specific criteria.",

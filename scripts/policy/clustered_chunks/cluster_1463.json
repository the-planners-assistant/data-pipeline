Part 1 of this policy sets out the broad locations and opportunity areas within the borough where growth (primarily housing delivery) and investment will be targeted over the lifetime of the plan. The growth will also be complemented by development on small sites. Significant housing delivery is needed across the borough to help alleviate overcrowding and to ensure genuinely affordable housing is provided to those most in need.",

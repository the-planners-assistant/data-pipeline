Biodiversity net gain delivers quantifiable improvements for biodiversity by creating or enhancing habitats in association with development. Biodiversity refers to all living organisms, including animals, insects, plants, bacteria, and fungi. A habitat is the area and resources used by a living organism or assemblage of animals and plants.

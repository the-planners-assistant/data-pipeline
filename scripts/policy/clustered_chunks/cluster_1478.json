    "text": "4. Development proposals should adopt a retrofit-first approach, prioritising retrofit and refurbishment of existing buildings over demolition and construction. Where demolition is proposed, it should be justified by demonstrating that options for retaining the existing buildings and the carbon cost of demolition have been fully explored, by: a. Undertaking a pre-demolition audit which demonstrates how materials will be reused; BACK TO POLICIES b. demonstrating how energy and waste will be minimised in the design and construction of the new building, through reuse of materials on-site or ensuring new materials are sustainably sourced and low impact; c. designing for durability and flexibility, disassembly, and reuse at the end of their useful life; and d. demonstrating how the design could support modification, adaption, or retrofitting to suit new uses in the future.",

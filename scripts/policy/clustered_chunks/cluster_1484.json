Within the Tower Hamlets Activity Areas and some District Centres and Neighbourhood Centres (as shown on the Policies Map), purpose-built office buildings can be supported where they are of a nature and scale which corresponds with their surroundings. Within the Primary and Secondary Frontages, employment spaces should be located on upper floors so as not to undermine the retail and leisure functions of those areas. 15.29 Proposals outside of designated employment locations and the town centre hierarchy (see Part 1) will be supported where they demonstrate that there is a need and demand for such employment uses, with further detail set out in Policy EG2.

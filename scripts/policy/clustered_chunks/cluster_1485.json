    "text": "13.11 New developments will be expected to be net zero carbon in operation where possible, with low energy use and high thermal efficiency. Developments will be expected to maximise renewable energy generation on site through the use of photovoltaic (PV) panels, reducing dependence on the National Grid and supporting access to low-cost clean energy. Delivering energy efficient buildings will also help to manage the increasing costs of energy bills faced by many borough residents and businesses. 13.12 To achieve net zero carbon, new developments must also minimise embodied carbon, and seek to drive down carbon emissions in the demolition, construction, and maintenance phases of a building. New developments should be designed with consideration of disassembly, reuse, or recycling to encourage sustainable material uses and minimise waste in line with circular economy principles.",

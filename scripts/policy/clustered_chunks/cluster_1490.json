However, in certain circumstances, such losses may be justified. Applicants should outline where and how marketing has been undertaken, including evidence of advertising on national commercial and retail property websites and a realistic asking rent. However, it is recognised that in some cases requiring marketing evidence may be counterproductive to enhancing local character if the condition of the property is such that attempting to let it would be unrealistic. In such cases, the applicant should submit a detailed report on the history and condition of the property to robustly justify why marketing evidence should not be required and that re-provided retail space as part of redevelopment",

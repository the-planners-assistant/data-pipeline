    "text": "4 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO CONTENTS Mayor’s foreword It is with great pleasure that I announce the production of a new draft Local Plan for the borough of Tower Hamlets. This is a critical step for our community at a time when we face some of the most significant challenges in our history. We need to respond to the cost-of-living crisis, ensure that we provide sufficient new homes and infrastructure to address the issue of overcrowding, particularly affecting our most vulnerable residents. As the fastest growing local authority in the country, with the highest housing target and youngest average age, all within one of London’s smallest geographical boundary areas (7.6 square miles), it is vital that we plan for sustainable development that is equitable and provides opportunities for future generations.",

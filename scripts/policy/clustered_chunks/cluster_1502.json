    "text": "13.50 The LETI Embodied Carbon Target Alignment document sets out an embodied carbon rating system, which outlines total embodied carbon targets and upfront carbon targets. These targets have been developed in collaboration with industry groups, including CIBSE, RIBA, and the GLA, and are being adopted by a number of local authorities in lieu of national and regional embodied carbon targets. 13.51 The LETI Embodied Carbon Primer (2020) identifies that current ‘business as usual’ building design (without implementing embodied carbon reductions) result in upfront carbon emissions of around 800kg CO2/m2 for domestic and 1,000kg CO2/m2 for non-domestic buildings, equivalent to a LETI band ‘E’ rating. Current best-practice performance projects in the design phase are able to achieve a LETI band ‘C’ rating, equivalent to 500kg CO2/m2 for domestic and 600kg CO2/m2 for nondomestic buildings. These targets are equivalent to 40% reduction over Tower Hamlets Local Plan 117",

The council will support development proposals that are design-led and respond to a site’s context and capacity for growth to determine the appropriate form and land use for the site and where they deliver on the borough’s needs for housing, employment, retail, and community space, and to create sustainable communities. All development proposals should demonstrate how the proposed capacity of the development has been informed by: a. the form and layout of the site, within its context, including appropriate scale, height and massing; b. the experience of future and existing residents and users of the site; c. the quality and character of the proposed development; d. the character of the 24 places of Tower Hamlets, as set out in the council’s Urban Structure and Characterisation Study (2009 and 2016 addendum);",

    "text": "14.57 The experience of the urban environment is collective and cumulative, and even small elements of poor design can significantly detract from how we experience, understand, and value a place. Good design, on the other hand, can contribute positively to the health and well-being of residents and the wider community. Therefore, all development will be expected to meet the highest possible standard of design. 14.58 Policy PS1 requires a design-led approach to new development and Policy PS3 complements this strategic approach to design by detailing some of the specific elements of good design that should be considered. This policy does not exhaust everything that should be considered as part of that design-led process, and in particular a design-led process will also be heavily influenced by engagement and consultation with the community â€“ but the requirements of this policy will help to ensure that the design-led process is successful.",

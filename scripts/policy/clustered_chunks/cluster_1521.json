    "text": "|Zone F|a. This zone consists of all areas suitable for tall buildings that do not fall within zones A to E. This zone has a mixed character, with variations across different neighbourhoods. b. Tall buildings in this area should show a variation in height to create a varied and interesting townscape, and should respond sensitively to the surrounding context. c. In locations where this zone is adjacent to zones A to E, heights within this zone should respond to the principles set out for zones A to E above, including through an appropriate step-down in height from adjacent developments. d. The tallest points should cluster around rail transport stations and within town centres. e. Buildings and clusters of buildings within this zone should not undermine the prominence of tall building zones A to E as the principal points of height in the borough. f. An appropriate height for the tallest points in this zone is 70m AOD.|",

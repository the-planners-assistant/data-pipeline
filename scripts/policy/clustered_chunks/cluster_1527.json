    "text": "14.60 New development should be well-integrated with existing development in the surrounding area (part 1(b)). This can be related to the physical characteristics of buildings, such as materials and form, but can just as importantly be related to the social elements of design. It is important that new development does not ‘turn its back on’ existing communities and create a feeling of exclusivity or separateness. New development should be seen and felt to benefit and contribute to existing communities, rather than to stand apart from them or to feel like an imposition on existing communities. 14.61 With regard to roof lines (part 1(c)), plant should ideally be located below ground rather than on the roof. However, where provided on the roof, it should be fully integrated into the form and design of the roof to avoid compromising the appearance of the building, including the profile and appearance from neighbouring buildings and in long views.",

Where it would result in an improvement in quantity and/or quality of open space, re-provision will be allowed. 12.108 Part 6 seeks the provision of new outdoor amenity space on-site which is well located, well designed and functional (including private amenity space, communal amenity space and child play space) to provide opportunities for residents to lead healthy and active lifestyles. 12.109 In considering the design and layout of private amenity space, it is important that the space meets the minimum standards set out in the policy (see part 5) to ensure that residents have sufficient space to carry out activities such as drying clothes or eating a meal outside.

    "text": "Tower Hamlets Local Plan 471 INTRODUCTIONSITE ALLOCATIONS z The site is in multiple ownership, and landowners and developers should work together to develop a comprehensive design-led masterplan for redevelopment of this site, to ensure development is delivered sustainably. Effective engagement between landowners, developers and leaseholders will be needed to facilitate potential land assembly and comprehensive redevelopment. z The site contains a number of existing buildings, some constructed fairly recently. When demolition and redevelopment is proposed, applications must robustly justify how they meet circular economy and sustainability principles set out in the rest of the development plan. z Development of residential uses on the eastern half of the site must demonstrate that they have considered and suitably mitigated against potential noise from the data centre uses within this area, in line with the Agent of Change principle.",

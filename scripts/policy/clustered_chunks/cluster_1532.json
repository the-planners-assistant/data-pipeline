    "text": "|Railway Arches|Railway arches house a wide range of industrial and other employment uses across the borough. They often provide lower-cost space than would be available in a purpose built building, and play an important role in the borough’s economy. Where they are in employment use (use classes E(g), B2, B8 and Sui generis employment uses), this will be retained and development that includes or is adjacent to railway arches will retain access and not undermine the flexible use of the arches. Railway arches can also provide space for community uses and other forms of social infrastructure.|Shadwell-Mile End Arches – these arches are underneath the railway line into Fenchurch Street, extending from Leman Street to Bow Road (including under the disused railway line alongside Tidworth Street) and contain a diverse range of uses, including a particular cluster of South Asian food wholesalers in Watney Market",

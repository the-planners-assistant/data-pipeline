Development proposals resulting in a net loss of employment floorspace within the Canary Wharf Preferred Office Location (CW POL) and the Canary Wharf Fringe (CW Fringe) will be supported where the proposal is for an alternative Strategic CAZ function, it can be demonstrated that the loss will not undermine the ability of the borough to meet its objectively assessed need for office floorspace and: a. active marketing has been carried out over a continuous period of at least 12 months at a reasonable market rent which accords with indicative figures; or b. in exceptional circumstances, provide robust demonstration that the site is unsuitable for continued employment use due to its condition, reasonable options for restoring the site to employment use are unviable, and that benefits of alternative use would outweigh the harm of loss of employment floorspace.",

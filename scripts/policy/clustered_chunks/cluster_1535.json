Sites that are registered under the scheme are independently assessed and monitored against a code of considerate practice, designed to encourage higher BACK TO POLICIES standards of conduct. We may also consider membership of alternative constructor schemes as also meeting the requirements of this policy. Developers are also encouraged to sign up to the Construction Logistics and Community Safety (CLOCS) standard which ensures constructors achieve the safest, leanest, and greenest construction vehicle journeys.",

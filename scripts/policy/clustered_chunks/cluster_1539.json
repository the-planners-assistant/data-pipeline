The social value strategy shall identify how the development will deliver social value benefits throughout its lifecycle including during its construction and operational phases, demonstrating that social value delivery has been integrated into the design of the scheme. The strategy will ensure that the development will maximise its positive contribution to economic well-being, social inclusion, equal opportunity, and community cohesion based on site-specific analysis and consultation. Such strategies can be informed by the councilâ€™s most up to date guidance on social value in development.",

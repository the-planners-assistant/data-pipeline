The council is actively exploring opportunities for the development of further waste management facilities to manage the Borough’s waste through its waste management strategy. 20.21 The construction of new, extended or replacement of existing waste management facilities must include, where possible, technologies that seek to extract as much material and value as possible through the repurposing, recycling, storage, and management of waste. Where opportunities arise for synergies or partnerships with delivery of the council’s waste management services these will be explored. BACK TO POLICIES",

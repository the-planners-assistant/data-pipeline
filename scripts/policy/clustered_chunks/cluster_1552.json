    "text": "This Local Plan will provide a blueprint for the future of Tower Hamlets, enabling us to deliver new homes, infrastructure, employment opportunities, and support for our town centres while moving towards a cleaner, greener future. The new Local Plan aligns with our councilâ€™s Strategic Plan and its priorities for investment in public services and improving the lives of our residents. The process of creating the new Local Plan for Tower Hamlets began in January 2022 and has involved early engagement with our communities to gather views and opinions. This has given us invaluable insights into the hopes and aspirations of our residents for the future of our borough and what they would like to see included in a new Local Plan. FOREWORD",

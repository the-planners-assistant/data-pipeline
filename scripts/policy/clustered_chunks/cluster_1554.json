    "text": "13.57 Where retrofitting works require planning permission, development proposals should submit a retrofit plan, which includes an energy improvement strategy. A retrofit plan demonstrates how retrofitting has been considered comprehensively across the building, using a ‘whole building approach’, which provides a holistic overview of how a building has been constructed, its context, and the factors affecting energy use. The retrofit plan should demonstrate a consideration for the most suitable retrofit works for the context of the building. Additional guidance on retrofit best practice and developing a retrofit plan is available in the Climate Emergency Retrofit Guide (LETI) and Key Considerations for Commercial Retrofit (UKGBC).",

The CCC has a clear position on carbon offsetting - offsetting must have a very limited role if we are to achieve national targets of zero carbon by 2050. Cash-inlieu contributions for carbon offsetting calculated at £/tonne CO2 will not be accepted. Energy offsetting will only be considered where the development has sought to minimise the building’s predicted energy usage and maximised PV generation on site. If council officers are satisfied that the development complies with these policy requirements, a cash-in-lieu payment will be accepted to offset the residual difference between energy use and renewable energy generation. In these circumstances, the applicant should establish the shortfall between predicted annual energy usage and annual renewable energy generation. The applicant should pay into the council’s offset fund a sum",

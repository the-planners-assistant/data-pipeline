The identified waste storage area must be designed to ensure refuse collection vehicles are able to enter and exit the highway in a forward gear and perform all collection activities within the curtilage of the development site. Applicants are advised to contact the waste management team that manages the collection of waste prior to submitting a planning application and adopt a collaborative approach to ensure these arrangements are in line with our waste collection services.

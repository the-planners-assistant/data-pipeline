    "text": "11.37 Part 4 of the policy seeks to ensure that construction impacts from the site and from other major developments within the vicinity of the proposal site are assessed and mitigation actions identified. Developers should take account of noise, vibration, artificial light, odour, air quality, fumes, dust or pollution, hours of operation, delivery timings and routes and location of equipment accordingly to reduce this impact. This should be evidenced through the Construction Logistics Plan (CLP), Construction Management Plan (CMP) and Site Environmental Management Plan (SEMP). Further guidance on producing a CLP can be found in the Sustainable Design and Construction Supplementary Planning Guidance (GLA 2014) and our latest CoCP.",

    "text": "13.5 Tower Hamlets is a low-lying borough that will severely suffer from increased flooding if the effects of climate change are not mitigated in the coming years. Whilst the Thames Barrier and other flood defences currently provide effective protection, their continued maintenance, along with further investment in flood defences, is required. Climate change will increase the risk of flooding, and it will be necessary to consider the ways of mitigating the risk of flooding for the lifetime of a development. The borough also has a number of critical drainage areas which are at higher risk of surface water flooding. London-wide vulnerability mapping indicates that Tower Hamlets is at increased risk of overheating resulting from a changing climate, and greater mitigation and adaption measures must be introduced to cope with the scale of these changes.

New publicly accessible open space will be expected to meet the design criteria in part 1. Notwithstanding, given the extent of residential development required and forecast for the borough, development proposals that maintain the existing 0.84ha per 1,000 residents standard will be considered. Reflecting the limited opportunities for significant new open space, and to ensure residents can enjoy the benefits of urban greening where new open space cannot be accommodated, the greening of council housing stock, estates, existing public realm, and place, and the overall enhancement of these areas, will be prioritised and encouraged.",

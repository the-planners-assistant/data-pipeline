    "text": "368 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO POLICIES REUSE, RECYCLING AND WASTE target of recycling 65% of municipal waste by 2030 and zero biodegradable waste to landfill by 2026. However, in 2021/2022, only 20% of household waste was reused, recycled, or composted in Tower Hamlets and it is recognised this needs to increase for those targets to be met. 20.6 Whilst London boroughs have not been set individual targets, Tower Hamlets is working towards meeting the London-wide target. The design of new development is required to ensure integrated waste collection and bulking systems are included which contribute to the boroughâ€™s ability to implement the waste hierarchy and increase recycling/ composting rates (see Policy RW3).",

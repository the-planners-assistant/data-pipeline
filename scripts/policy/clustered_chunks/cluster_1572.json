    "text": "are delivered. [20] 13.99 Part 1 of this policy seeks to reduce the pressure on fresh and wastewater systems through reducing demand and requiring high levels of water efficiency in all new developments. The London Plan requires new residential development to reduce water consumption to 105 litres p/person p/day or less, which acknowledges the water scarcity prevalent in London. As Tower Hamlets indirectly draws its mains water resource from the river Lee, where groundwater abstractions need to be reduced significantly to avoid the destruction of precious and globally unique chalk stream habitats, it is necessary to reduce local mains water demand below building regulations.",

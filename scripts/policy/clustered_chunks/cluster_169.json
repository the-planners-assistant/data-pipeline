Form, massing, and heritage z Height Strategy: The tallest point should be located towards the west of the site, but to the east of the Millwall Cutting. Heights should step down towards the eastern end of the site, and to the west of the tallest point in order to preserve the townscape of the Skyline of Strategic Importance. z Development should maintain the existing block structure whilst respecting its dockside location and surrounding built environment â€“ in particular providing a transition in scale in relation to the lower rise buildings to the south-east and ensure appropriate spacing between buildings to enable visual permeability between Marsh Wall and BACK TO CONTENTS South Dock, and variation in heights to avoid the creation of a canyonlike effect along Marsh Wall.",

Where a variation from these standards is sought, a detailed submission of the reasons and noise effects must be provided as early as possible, preferably through the pre-application process. Any variation will be considered with respect to the context of the scheme (including its use, design, and location) and any wider benefits, as directed by national policy and guidance.

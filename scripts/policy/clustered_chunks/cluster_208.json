Improvements to the green grid should be provided along Whitechapel High Street, Stepney Way, New Road, and Cavell Street, along with good quality connections to surrounding green grid routes. This is a large site, and connections need to be improved both north-south and east-west. Environment and public realm z Development should contribute to the delivery of a new and improved green open space (the Green Spine) stretching from Philpot Street to the new civic centre. It should be linear in nature and provide a direct visual link and improved north-south legibility across its length. z Existing consented open space which has yet to be implemented on",

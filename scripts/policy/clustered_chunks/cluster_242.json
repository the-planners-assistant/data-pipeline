The presence of protected species is a material planning consideration where a development is likely to result in harm to a habitat or species. Priority species are those identified in the Tower Hamlets Local Biodiversity Action Plan, Species of Conservation Concern in London and Species of Principal Importance in England, as identified under section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act. Developers should ensure that they comply with regulations requiring time-restricted ground works due to the time periods of specific protected species activity.",

A transport statement may be accompanied by a construction management and logistics plan or a delivery and servicing plan depending on the type of land use and its location; this should also be established and scoped out with our transport and development management teams at the pre-application stage. 19.44 Transport assessments and statements will be required to provide detailed information on the range of transport users and modes, including the movement of people and goods, both before and after a proposed development has been constructed. A transport assessment or statement should identify and address transport impacts on all modes of transport and set out the measures to avoid, remedy or mitigate identified impacts of the development.",

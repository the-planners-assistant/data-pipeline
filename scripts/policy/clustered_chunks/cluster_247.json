    "text": "20.3 The management of waste rarely respects administrative boundaries and hence waste is considered to be a strategic crossboundary issue and is subject to the duty to co-operate [35] . In the interests of proper planning and sustainable development Tower Hamlets, through the duty co-operate mechanism, will seek to secure access to sufficient waste management capacity to meet the boroughâ€™s apportionments as set out in the London Plan and ensures construction, demolition and excavation waste is also properly managed. We will support the transition to the circular economy through the establishment of Material Hubs. Material Hubs can be used to store otherwise unused material which can be reused, repaired, or repurposed within or outside the borough. It is expected that Materials Hubs will be initially trialled in the early part of the plan period and scale up in the medium to long term reducing the quantity of construction and demolition waste requiring management in particular.",

These benchmarks set out the maximum allowable emissions of NOx and particulate matter based on the size and use class of the proposed development, and are designed to prevent the degradation of air quality from the combined emissions of individual developments. Air Quality Neutral applies only to the completed development and does not include impacts arising from construction, which should be separately assessed in the Air Quality Assessment.|",

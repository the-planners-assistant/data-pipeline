Some objectives are based on long term exposure (e.g. annual averages), with some based on short term objectives. Objectives only apply where a member of the public may be exposed to pollution over the relevant averaging time.| |Air Quality Positive approach||A process of identifying and implementing ways to push a development beyond compliance with both the Air Quality Neutral benchmarks and the minimum requirements of an air quality assessment. To achieve this, an AQP Statement should be submitted that demonstrates how benefits to local air quality have been maximised, and how measures to minimise pollution exposure will be implemented.| |Amenity||A quality of a location or neighbourhood that helps to make it attractive or enjoyable for residents and visitors.|",

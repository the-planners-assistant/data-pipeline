    "text": "SITE ALLOCATIONSINTRODUCTION Routes and streets z Create new east-west and north-south walking and cycling routes. These should align with the existing grid geometry of Canary Wharf to create a legible, permeable and well-defined movement network, particularly connecting to Canary Wharf and Marsh Wall East. Development must provide access along the waterfront at Blackwall Basin and South Dock, and provide comfortable access to these spaces. Improved green grid connections should be delivered through the site, with good quality onward connections to green grid routes at Prestonâ€™s Road and towards Jubilee Park and the Billingsgate Market site allocation. Environment and public realm z Prevent excessive overshadowing and enable activation of the riverside by ensuring buildings are stepped back from the water edge. z Provide a range of new publicly accessible open spaces, including a consolidated open space of at least 1 hectare in size.",

    "text": "INTRODUCTIONSITE ALLOCATIONS BACK TO CONTENTS Environment and public realm z Prevent excessive overshadowing of the dockside and enable activation of the waterfront by ensuring development is stepped back from the water, and consider the operational needs of boat operators. z The pedestrian environment along Marsh Wall axis is currently restrictive. This key street route should be a pedestrian friendly environment. Existing and new routes between the Marsh Wall axis and South Dock should be designed primarily for pedestrians and incorporate landscape and SUDs feature. z Create open spaces around the DLR that should be well defined by public green space or public squares and active building frontages. Open space is in short supply in this location â€“ with views across the dock basin provide the sense of openness. The public routes and spaces alongside the edges of South Dock should be generous.",

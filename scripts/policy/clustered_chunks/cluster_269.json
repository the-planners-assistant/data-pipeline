They are smaller than Neighbourhood Centres and typically serve an extremely local catchment (in the region of a five-minute walking radius, or in some cases a single large housing estate).| |Neighbourhood Plan||Neighbourhood plans give communities the power to plan for the areas in which they live. These must be in general conformity with the strategic priorities of the development plan, and have regard to national policy and guidance and should not promote less development than set out in the Local Plan. An adopted plan will form a part of the statutory development plan and will be used to inform planning applications within this area.|",

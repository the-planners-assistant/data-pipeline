    "text": "1.2.1 Form, layout, and orientation Increased dispersion of pollution can be achieved through suitable form, layout and orientation of buildings and developments. Exposure to poor air quality is minimised through increasing distances between the source (such as roads, railways, and large combustion facilities) and the receptor (i.e. places where human exposure is most likely to occur). This is especially important for sensitive land uses (hospitals, schools, childrenâ€™s playgrounds etc.). 1.2.2 Ventilation Ventilation systems should account for the impact of ambient air pollution on indoor air quality, such as through the location of air intakes away from sources of poor air quality (such as at roof level and away from exhaust flues). It may be more appropriate to locate less sensitive land uses (such as commercial units) at ground level, where exposure to roadside air pollution is more likely to be transient.",

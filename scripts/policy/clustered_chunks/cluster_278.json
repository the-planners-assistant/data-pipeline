Tower Hamlets has a diverse economy ranging from the globally significant financial centre of Canary Wharf and the associated services required to support it (and the neighbouring City of London) to creative and cultural industries, industrial uses, secondary offices, and businesses meeting a very local need. Employment activities are distributed across the borough with specific locations supporting clusters of particular businesses or unit types.

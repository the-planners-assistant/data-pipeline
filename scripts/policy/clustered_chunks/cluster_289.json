    "text": "19.54 Part 1(a) sets out that a car-free approach is required in areas of Tower Hamlets where there are good levels of existing or planned public transport accessibility and where there is significant residential growth expected in the coming years. Furthermore, in line with the London Plan, all development proposals within the boroughâ€™s Opportunity Areas, CAZ, Metropolitan and Major town centres must be car free. Where there are high levels of public transport accessibility, alternative modes of transport will be promoted. 19.55 When applying the residential parking standards from the London Plan, development proposals should consider future changes to public transport accessibility levels (PTAL) as a result of new infrastructure provision, particularly in areas of low public transport accessibility (PTAL 1 and 2).

    "text": "|Urban Heat Island efef ct|UHI|An Urban Heat Island (UHI) is an urban area that is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas. This happens because the sun's rays are absorbed by hard surfaces rather than by vegetation such as trees, plants, and grass. Radiation from hard surfaces is released into the air as heat. This process exacerbates the city's already hotter and drier summers through urban heat island effect. The UHI reduces the ability for the city to cool and impacts our capacity to regulate temperature.| |Waste apportionment||The amount of London's waste that each borough is required to manage to ensure London is self-sufficient in managing its municipal, commercial and industrial waste that it produces. This requires an amount of land to be safeguarded within the borough.|",

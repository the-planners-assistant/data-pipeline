    "text": "20.44 Part 1(l) seeks to mitigate adverse impacts associated with waste management facilities. Waste management facilities should be enclosed and covered on all vertical sides with small access and egress points, fitted with fast-acting doors, and incorporate an air filtering system to reduce airborne particulate concentrations in and outside of the building in line with Environment Agency advice. This provides an effective way of controlling dust and particulate pollution within waste developments. In cases where enclosure is not possible, proposals must provide details of proposed measures demonstrating how the control measures can adequately mitigate these impacts. Operators will be expected to obtain the appropriate environmental permits from the Environment Agency or the Local Authority and comply with the conditions of those permits at all times.",

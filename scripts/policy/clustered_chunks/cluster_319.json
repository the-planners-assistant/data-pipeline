    "text": "Tower Hamlets. Table 14: Capacity Assessment of Existing facilities managing apportioned waste in Tower Hamlets (tonnes per annum) [44] |Capacity source|LACW/C&I management capacity| ||| |Existing licensed waste sites|160,000tpa| |Exempt waste sites|40,000tpa| |Onsite segregation facilities|17,600tpa| |Total assessed capacity|217,600tpa| |Total potential capacity|217,600tpa| 20.18 When the value of c220,000 tpa is compared with the apportioned tonnages presented in Table 14 above, it shows that the assessed capacity ought to be sufficient to meet the apportionment requirement. However given the identified shortfall in capacity for the management of construction and demolition waste predicted to arise in the borough over the Plan period, it is still considered appropriate to identify areas of search where facilities offering additional waste management capacity may be developed, on a precautionary basis.",

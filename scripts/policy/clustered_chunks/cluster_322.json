The length of time that would constitute ‘an extended period of time’ for the purposes of this policy will vary depending on the nature of the community facility and the community it serves, but in any case a closure of more than three months will require the provision of a temporary facility. The temporary facility should be designed in conjunction with the community facility operator and should meet their needs. Its location should be in close proximity to the existing facility, and should be easily accessible to the community that the facility serves.

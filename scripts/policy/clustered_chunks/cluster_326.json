    "text": "SITE ALLOCATIONSINTRODUCTION Routes and streets z Improve walking and cycling routes to, from and within the site to establish connections to Shoreditch High Street Overground station, Brick Lane District Centre, Shoreditch Triangle and the new open space. These should align with the existing urban grain to support permeability and legibility. Connections should be made to the green grid at Brick Lane and Quaker Street. Environment and public realm z Integrate development with the surrounding area and improve the street frontage and public realm on key routes, particularly along Wheler Street and ensure it is well integrated into the public squares to the east and south of the station. z Provide a consolidated open space with a minimum size of one hectare, integrated with the green grid along Quaker Street and Brick Lane in the form of a multi-functional local park located above the Braithwaite Viaduct.

    "text": "z Proposals on this site should be in accordance with the principles of the Hackney Wick Masterplan. z Development should deliver a mix of uses around the rebuilt Hackney Wick Station, integrate with established retail frontage at Felstead Street and Prince Edward Road, and utilise buildings of heritage value. SITE ALLOCATIONSINTRODUCTION z The overall amount of existing employment floorspace (B Use Class) within the allocation boundary must be maintained, with a particular emphasis on retaining and providing for creative and cultural industries and any other businesses that are compatible with residential use. z Queenâ€™s Yard will act as a high-quality public space defined by a mixture of cultural and public uses that complement existing uses such as The White Building and the Yard Theatre. In line with policy CI5, development should aim to protect the theatre use on this site.",

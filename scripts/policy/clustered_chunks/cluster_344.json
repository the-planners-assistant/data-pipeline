Environment and public realm: z Integrate buildings with improved public realm and ensure development is stepped back from the docksides with fully accessible active frontages. The priority for improved public realm is the waterfront edge along Millwall Inner Dock, which should provide space for a range of uses and be well-connected to South Quay DLR station. z Improve the quality of public realm and create a positive sense of place with an arrival point in the form of an active square at the corner of Marsh Wall and Limeharbour. z Provide well defined public green open space or public squares with active building frontages around the DLR viaduct. The open space should be well integrated into the development.",

BACK TO CONTENTS Approaches to managing noise 1. \u0007Good design – Ensuring developments incorporate the concept of “good acoustic design” [1], including through minimising the number of sensitive receptors exposed to noise; ensuring adequate distances between the noise source and sensitive receptors or areas, limiting conflict of use in the development both internally and externally; utilising where possible barriers, natural or otherwise, other buildings, or non-critical rooms in a building. 2. \u0007Engineering – reducing noise at source; improving the sound insulation internally and externally of exposed receptors; screening by purpose-built barriers.",

    "text": "2. New major residential development proposals must incorporate high-quality on-site waste collection systems that do not include traditional methods of storage and collection and are compatible with waste collection methods set out in the Tower Hamlets Reuse, Recycling and Waste SPD. In instances where this is not practicable, supporting evidence must be submitted with the application to demonstrate this. 3. New residential, non-residential, and mixed-use development proposals should be accompanied by a Waste Management Plan that complies with the requirements of Tower Hamlet’s Reuse, Recycling and Waste SPD. 4. Provision of waste storage and collection should be informed through early engagement with relevant London Borough of Tower Hamlet’s service areas. Developments that propose provision of onsite waste management technologies should be discussed at an early stage of design with the London Borough of Tower Hamlet’s waste management team.

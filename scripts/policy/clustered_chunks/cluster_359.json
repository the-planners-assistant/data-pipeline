    "text": "20.36 The policy seeks to incorporate flexibility into the assessment of new waste management uses, recognising the evolving nature of both waste management practices and national and regional policies that may result in a need for retrofit or the delivery of new waste management facilities in the borough. 20.37 New waste management facilities will be directed towards existing safeguarded sites and areas of search (as set out in Policy RW1). In other locations, such facilities will still be expected to meet the criteria set out in Policy RW2 as well as any other relevant policies within the plan. Windfall proposals for waste management facilities outwith existing sites, safeguarded sites or areas of search will be required to demonstrate why it is not feasible to do so within the areas identified in RW1.",

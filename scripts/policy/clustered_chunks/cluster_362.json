The available evidence indicates that Tower Hamlets is likely to be meeting these targets although the data is not definitive. [39] 20.11 Tower Hamlets is also required to plan for hazardous waste, wastewater, agricultural waste, and low-level radioactive waste. The evidence concludes that no additional facilities are required within the borough for these waste streams because they are only produced in very small quantities and/or they are managed at specialist facilities outside the borough.

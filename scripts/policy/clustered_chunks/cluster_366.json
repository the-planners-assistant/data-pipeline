    "text": "428 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO CONTENTS Routes and streets z Improve walking and cycling connections to, from and within the site - particularly to and along the River Lea to Bromley-by-Bow District Centre, Aberfeldy Neighbourhood Centre and to Langdon Park DLR station. These should align with the existing urban grain to support permeability and legibility. Provide an active and well-defined street frontage along Lochnagar Street, and create a stronger east-west link between the River Lea and the Langdon Park DLR station. z Development must provide public access along the waterfront at the River Lea. Improved green grid routes should be delivered along the River Lea waterfront and along Lochnagar Street, with good quality onward connections to the adjoining green grid route at Zetland Street and the Teviot Estate site allocation. z Development should provide appropriate riparian lifesaving infrastructure along the riverside path.",

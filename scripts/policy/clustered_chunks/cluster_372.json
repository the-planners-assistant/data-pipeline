    "text": "Association of Noise Consultants, 2017). 544 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO CONTENTS General principles When considering applications for development that will be exposed to an existing noise source, we will take into account the ambient noise level existing at the proposed location at the time of the application and any future likely increase in noise impact that may reasonably be anticipated to occur due to development in the foreseeable future. Much of the borough is subject to ambient noise levels during the day and at night from transportation, commercial, industrial and leisure sources that are higher than those at which the lowest adverse effects, as defined in policy and guidance, can occur. Development therefore should not make the noise circumstances worse and where possible should improve the situation by lowering noise levels and/or modifying the soundscape in a positive fashion.",

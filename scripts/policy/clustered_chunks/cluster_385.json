    "text": "essential to improve local and wider connectivity and integration of new and existing communities across the area. z An improved junction which provides vehicular and pedestrian access from the site to and across the A12 is required, to improve access to the wider Bow area and to Bromley-by-Bow Station. This should include at-grade pedestrian and cycle crossings and the potential to facilitate the ‘Bow Vision’ bus route, connecting through Bromley-byBow to Sugar House Island via a potential new bridge. z Development must provide public access along the waterfront at the River Lea, and improved access points onto the north canal towpath. Improved green grid routes should be delivered along Three Mills Lane, Imperial Street, and along the River Lea waterfront, with good quality onward connections across the A12 to join the rest of the green grid. Careful consideration should be given as to how to best route the riverside path around Bow Free Wharf to ensure its continued operation.",

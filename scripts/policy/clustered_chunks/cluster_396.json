    "text": "17.37 Part 2 seeks to avoid future examples in the borough of what are termed ‘trojan horse’ pubs. This term refers to developments that have met policy requirements through the re-provision of floorspace for pub use but at a level that is insufficient to be practically let as a pub, resulting in a subsequent application to convert the space to an alternative use. This part of the policy seeks to ensure that there is a genuine intention to continue pub use where redevelopment is proposed. It must also be demonstrated that appropriate soundproofing is to be installed to minimise conflict between the pub and any residential use. In order to satisfy this criterion, applicants should submit indicative floorplans demonstrating that, at a minimum, the proposed floorspace for pub use can support a bar area, appropriate seating, storage, toilets and no loss of any additional community and amenity space that could be used for cultural uses.",

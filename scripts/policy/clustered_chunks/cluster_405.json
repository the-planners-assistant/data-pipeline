It is also essential that new employment development does not undermine the operations of existing businesses, including ensuring that full access, operations, and servicing are maintained. Where existing businesses in close proximity to the development site have the potential to cause noise, pollution, or vibration issues, the proposed development must ensure that it is designed to mitigate these issues, in accordance with the London Planâ€™s Agent of Change principle.",

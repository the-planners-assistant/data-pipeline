In this context, outstanding universal value is defined by UNESCO as “areas of cultural and/or national significance so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations of all humanity”. Attributes of outstanding universal value are usually physical, but can also be processes or practices (such as tradition, or management regimes) that have an impact on physical qualities.",

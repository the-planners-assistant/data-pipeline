    "text": "18.109 Given the high level of demand for existing allotments and community gardens and the increased pressure that new development is placing on all such facilities, Part 2 encourages development proposals for community facilities and major residential developments to provide and properly equip space within their sites for community gardening and food growing. Any new allotment space should be accessible and inclusive and should be considered in the context of the wider public realm. Maximising the reuse of rainwater for watering and the provision of watering points should be considered when providing new facilities. 18.110 Allotments and community gardens are good for community activities and should be developed with accessibility in mind, considering adequate space provision for wheelchair access and wayfinding.",

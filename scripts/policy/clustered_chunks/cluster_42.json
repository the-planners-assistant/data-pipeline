    "text": "1.3 Heating and energy supply The adoption of technologies to generate heat and energy from efficient and/or renewable sources can minimise air pollution emissions. This is due to the technologies either not requiring combustion or, in the case of district heating, being more efficient at heating than individual boilers. Such technologies can include solar water heating, connection to heat BACK TO CONTENTS networks, heat pumps (air-source or ground-source) and/or photovoltaic panels. These technologies therefore give rise to lower emissions of local pollutants and hence improve air quality locally. 1.3.1 Generators Diesel generators produce high emissions of NOx and particulate matter and can lead to adverse impacts on both long- and short- term concentrations of air pollutants. Generators are often installed for emergency or life safety purposes, but may also be proposed for",

    "text": "bodies. 18.12 Figure 18 illustrates the distribution of publicly accessible open spaces across the borough. Detailed boundaries of the borough’s publicly accessible open spaces are shown on the Policies Map. Some of the borough’s open spaces and water spaces are designated as Metropolitan Open Land (including East India Dock Basin and Brunswick Wharf, Island Gardens, Lee Valley Regional Park, Meath Gardens, Mile End Park, Mudchute Park, Millwall Park, Tower Hamlets Cemetery and Victoria Park) which form part of London’s strategically defined open space network. 18.13 Part 1(a) seeks to protect all open spaces regardless of their size, type, ownership and where access is unrestricted, partially restricted, or restricted. 18.14 Part 1(b) seeks to protect the open character of Metropolitan Open Land (MOL). MOL is a unique open space designation in London and is afforded the same level of protection as the Green Belt within the London Plan.",

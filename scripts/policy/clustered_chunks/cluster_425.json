    "text": "17.14 Part 5 of this policy requires development proposals to provide an on-site community facility as part of strategic residential development applications where up to date evidence demonstrates that this is required. Such provision would need to support and reflect the needs of the borough’s culturally diverse community. Applicants must engage with the council’s planning team as early as possible to determine the nature of the community facility, and ensure it will be meeting the needs of the local area. Applicants must demonstrate through the pre-application and application stage how the provision of the community facility has been considered as part of the design process, and that consultation has been undertaken with local residents and key stakeholders to determine what facilities are likely to be appropriate. The council will expect such provision to be made unless design constraints and/or viability make such a facility undeliverable or there",

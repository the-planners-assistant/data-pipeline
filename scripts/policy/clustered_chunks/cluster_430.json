    "text": "16.70 The council also encourages night-time uses to sign up to schemes that seek to improve the safety of leisure and night-time activities, particularly those that involve the consumption of alcohol. Such schemes include ‘Ask for Angela’ and National Pubwatch. 16.71 Given the town centres first approach taken by the Local Plan, the London Plan and the NPPF, Part 2 requires proposals for night-time uses outside of town centres to robustly demonstrate that they cannot be accommodated in a town centre location. Where night-time uses are proposed outside of the town centre hierarchy, they should demonstrate that the site has good night-time public transport accessibility, meaning that the site is within 400m (roughly a 5-minute walk) of a night bus stop or night tube station.",

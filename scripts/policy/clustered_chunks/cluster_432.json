Examples of these facilities include theatres, music venues, rehearsal spaces, cinemas, night clubs, galleries, museums, and historic culture sites. 17.42 The London Plan defines arts and culture facilities as spaces where arts and culture are produced, consumed or participated in. for the purposes of this plan, spaces where arts and culture are produced are addressed in the Inclusive Economy and Good Growth chapter. Where there is overlap, and spaces include both production and consumption or participation, both this policy and the policies in the Inclusive Economy and Good Growth chapter will apply.",

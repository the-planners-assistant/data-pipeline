    "text": "14.131 Under part 2 of the policy, proposals relating to works to a listed building or within the vicinity of a listed building or to other heritage assets will be required to demonstrate that they will not affect the special interest of the listed building or heritage asset. In addition to planning permission, listed building consent may also be required for works that will affect the special character of a listed building. Harm to the significance of a heritage asset will not ordinarily be supported. Where such harm is proposed, proposals will need to include robust BACK TO POLICIES justification of why the public benefits of the proposal outweigh the harm to heritage significance, and will need to demonstrate that alternative options that avoid harm have been explored and found unfeasible, and that the proposed harm has been mitigated to the greatest degree possible.",

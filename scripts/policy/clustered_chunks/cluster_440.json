    "text": "Routes and streets z Improve walking and cycling connections to, from and within the site. These should align with the existing urban grain to support permeability and legibility. The existing complex network of streets and cul-de-sacs should be replaced by a permeable street grid network which fully integrates and makes direct connections with its context creating a stronger and more legible street network across the estate. Improved green grid routes should be delivered along Aberfeldy Street, Blair Street, and Abbott Road, with good onward connections provided to Jollyâ€™s Green and green grid routes across the A12 and A13 and towards the Leven Road and Teviot Estate site allocations. z Aberfeldy Street will be a strong and more legible public route across the estate, which will better establish connections with new development to the south and provide direct connections to the riverside area at the north.

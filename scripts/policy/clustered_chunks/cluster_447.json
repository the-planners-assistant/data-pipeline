Where a development proposes the provision of affordable commercial space for a shorter period, the proposal will need to provide robust viability testing to demonstrate that the period proposed is the longest viable period of time that the space can be provided. In no case will a period of less than 20 years be accepted, to ensure certainty for both the operators and the end users, and to allow the space to support multiple businesses from start-up to move-on. 238 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO POLICIES",

    "text": "16.31 Parts 1 and 4 expect all types of businesses occupying ground floor spaces in town centres to engage with the street, including maintaining visibility into the business, and providing engaging window displays. Regard should also be had to the Tower Hamlets Shopfront Design Guidance. The Primary Frontages (see Part 1) will have the highest levels of activity and footfall. As such, non-retail uses in these locations should be of a type that enhances the character and attractiveness of the town centre as a place to visit, such as caf√©s, restaurants and drinking establishments. Other uses would be appropriate on upper floors within the primary frontages, such as offices, gyms, or residential uses. However, access to upper levels must be designed to promote street-level activity and not undermine the viability of ground-level units.",

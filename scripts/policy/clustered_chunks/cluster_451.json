Where development proposals include the provision of new play and informal recreation spaces and sports facilities, these should be designed to be welcoming to all communities in the borough, with clear routes to the spaces and facilities and wayfinding or signage from the nearest major route where necessary. Where a development proposal is in close proximity to an existing play or informal recreation space or sports facility, it should provide public realm enhancements that improve the routes to the space or facility, particularly where it is a larger space or facility that is likely to draw users from the wider neighbourhood. 18.105 Play and recreation spaces and facilities should serve all members of the Tower Hamlets community and should be genuinely inclusive.",

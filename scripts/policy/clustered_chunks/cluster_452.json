    "text": "uses such as bars, smaller cinemas, small to medium sized theatres and music venues would be directed to all centres listed in point 2 Part 2 of Policy TC1. 16.67 Large concentrations of night-time uses, particularly those that are focused on alcohol consumption, can have negative impacts on the amenity and safety of the surrounding area. They can also reduce the daytime vitality and viability of the town centre if they are only open from the evening. It is, therefore, important to ensure that the development of new night-time uses does not result in an overconcentration. Applicants should provide information on the number of similar uses that operate BACK TO POLICIES in the evening and at night within the centre to demonstrate that the proposed development will not result in an overconcentration.",

Some smaller proposals may also be referred to the panel, particularly in instances where there are concerns around elements of the design, or where they may have significant effects on heritage assets. Proposals are usually expected to be presented to the panel twice, once at preapplication stage and once at application stage, and applicants should be prepared to explain how the comments of the panel have been addressed.",

Some parks (e.g. Victoria Park) are nationally renowned and have been awarded Green Flag status. 18.4 As the population continues to grow there will be an increasing need to protect and revitalise our existing open spaces as well as secure additional publicly accessible open space and our access to these spaces, especially within deficient areas (see Figure 18).

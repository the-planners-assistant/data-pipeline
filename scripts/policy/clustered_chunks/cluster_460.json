The amount of affordable workspace to be provided will be calculated using the full GIA of the data centre, including space only used for servers. Particular constraints unique to data centres, including their plant needs, floorplates and security concerns, may make on-site provision unfeasible. In these cases, off-site provision or a payment-in-lieu may be accepted.",

    "text": "the character of the Fournier Street Conservation Area should be preserved and, where possible, enhanced. For further details, refer to the Tower Hamlets Conservation Strategy and relevant Conservation Area Character Appraisals. Routes and streets z Improve walking and cycling connections to, from and within the site, particularly to connect up Allen Gardens, the Truman Brewery estate, and Shoreditch High Street station. These connections should align with the existing urban grain to support permeability and provide easy access to the district centre. Improved green grid routes should be delivered along Brick lane, Fournier Street, Buxton Street, Quaker Street, and Wentworth Street, with good quality onward connections to adjoining green grid routes towards Shoreditch High Street Station and the adjacent Bishopsgate Goods Yard site allocation, and along Whitechapel High Street.

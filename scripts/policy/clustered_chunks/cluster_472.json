    "text": "BACK TO POLICIES National Trail. We are committed to maintaining the existing National Trail and expanding the Thames Path along the eastern part of the Isle of Dogs to connect it to the Leaway as a publicly accessible continuous route. Developments adjacent to the river Thames should contribute towards the delivery and maintenance of this route. This will be secured by planning obligation. Where the Thames Path cannot be delivered adjacent to the river Thames, due to heritage reasons, we will require the development to contribute towards the signposting, design and maintenance of an alternative route. 18.64 Wharves and terminals with limited accessibility also pose a challenge to finding appropriate routes. It is encouraged that developers consider pragmatic solutions which would allow for safer access around these sites.",

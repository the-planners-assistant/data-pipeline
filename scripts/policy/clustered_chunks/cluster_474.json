For the purposes of this policy, the local neighbourhood is defined as an area within 15-minute walking distance (1km) using existing pedestrian routes. 18.101 The Play Space Strategy, based on findings from the Tower Hamlets Child Play Space Audit (2024), sets out an indicator of where existing play spaces need to be protected and enhanced throughout the borough due to the overall deficiency of play space. 18.102 It is encouraged that high value play spaces are identified and developed in areas which are deficient in play space as indicated in the Play Space Audit. Developers will be required to ensure play space is under review and will be monitored by the consent and delivery of new high-value play spaces through planning applications.",

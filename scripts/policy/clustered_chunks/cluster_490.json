    "text": "19.2 Tower Hamlets is a well-connected borough, with access to the London Underground, Docklands Light Railway, National Rail connections and an extensive bus network. There has been significant increase in public transport infrastructure to accommodate growth, most recently including the opening of the Elizabeth Line at Whitechapel and Canary Wharf stations. The borough has good levels of sustainable travel; in 2023, Tower Hamlets was ranked 7th out of all London Boroughs on the Healthy Streets Scorecard, and improvements to walking and cycling connections means that over 80% of trips last year were by sustainable modes (public transport, walking, and cycling). However, there are some areas of the borough which are less well served by public transport, particularly towards the east of the borough.",

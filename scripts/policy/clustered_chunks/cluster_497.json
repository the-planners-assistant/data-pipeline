    "text": "z This site could potentially be suitable for accommodation for people with learning disabilities. Form, massing, and heritage z Height Strategy: Taller elements should be focused around the existing tall building at the Royal London Hospital. Appropriate heights of 68m on the Post Office site, 61m on Floyer House, 88m on the northern part of the Whitechapel Estate, and 64m on the southern part of the Whitechapel Estate. Heights should step down towards the west of the site. z The impact of development on nearby heritage assets and conservation areas should be considered â€“ heritage assets should be protected or enhanced, and any negative impacts mitigated, because heritage and historic conservation plays a vital role in benefitting place shaping, social cohesion and the economy. This includes the setting of the London Hospital Conservation Area. For further details, refer to the Tower Hamlets Conservation Strategy and relevant Conservation Area Character Appraisals.",

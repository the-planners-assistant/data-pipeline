    "text": "274 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO POLICIES outside of the town centre hierarchy. Examples might include facilities that enhance the enjoyment of open spaces and water spaces; serve transport interchanges or serve out-of-town-centre employment areas. For instance, pubs play an important role as community meeting spaces and can often be located in otherwise wholly residential areas or industrial areas. Tower Hamlets also contains a number of micro breweries and distilleries. These are often located within industrial areas and may include tap rooms or bars. The primary use of these facilities should be the production of beverages, and the bar or tap room should take up a relatively small proportion of the floor area. A condition may be imposed limiting the size of the bar or tap room to ensure that it remains a secondary use.",

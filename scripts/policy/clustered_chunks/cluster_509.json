    "text": "Conservation Strategy and relevant Conservation Area Character Appraisals. Routes and streets z Improve walking and cycling connections to, from and within the site â€“ particularly to Langdon Park, Bartlett Park, Jollys Green, and All Saints DLR station. These should align with the existing urban form and grain to support east-west connectivity and wider permeability. An improved green grid connection should be provided through the centre of the site, with good quality onward connections to green grid routes at Cordelia Street and East India Dock Road. z Development should ensure sufficient and well-integrated access arrangements for highways and servicing to the district centre and market, and should minimise conflict between pedestrians, cyclists, and motorised vehicles. Environment and public realm z Improve the public realm with active site edges, particularly along East India Dock Road and within the district centre.",

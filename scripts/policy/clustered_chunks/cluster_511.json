The scale of development must reflect the level of public transport available. Transport for London (TfL) has mapped the Public Transport Accessibility Levels (PTAL) across the whole of London; the PTAL toolkit is a measure of accessibility to the public transport network, taking into account walk access times and service availability. Areas are graded on a scale between 0 and 6b, with a score of 0 is very poor access to public transport, and 6b is excellent access to public transport. In Tower Hamlets, ratings range from highly accessible areas â€“ such as Canary Wharf, Whitechapel, Bethnal Green, Bow and Mile End - to areas with lower levels of public transport accessibility, including parts of the Lower MOVEMENT AND CONNECTIVITY",

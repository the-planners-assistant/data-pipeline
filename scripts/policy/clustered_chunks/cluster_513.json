In order to ensure that the provision of affordable workspace supports this role, space in this part of the borough should be designed to meet the needs of creative businesses. 15.58 Part 5 recognises that high service charges can be an impediment to the take up of affordable workspace by operators and tenants. The overall service charge should reflect only what the affordable workspace tenants have access to and should not include unnecessary additional amenities or overly expensive facilities. The service charge paid by the affordable workspace tenants will be capped at 50% of their reasonable proportion of the overall workspace service charge, including any costs associated with the entrance and internal common parts of the building which the space has rights to. Development proposals should ensure that fit-out of the affordable workspace allows for easy and inexpensive maintenance where possible.",

Providing cycle parking must not be seen as a tick-box exercise to provide required quantity at the expense of quality; for example, while stacked two-tier cycle racks can provide a large amount of storage in a limited space, they are only suitable for standard two-wheel bikes and can require significant upper-body strength to use. Consideration should also be given to a variety of users and mobility options, such as space for non-standard cycles, mobility scooters, and cargo bikes.",

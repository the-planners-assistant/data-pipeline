    "text": "20.30 There are a number of pieces of equipment, which may provide appropriate on-site waste processing including, but not limited to, micro digesters and composting units. 20.31 The flexibility of these systems is such that it reduces the need for separate collections of food waste to be carried out within the development and thereby reducing vehicle movements. Where such systems are proposed, it will be the responsibility of the managing agent to maintain the system/facility. An agreement will also need to be made with the council with regards to securing the long -term availability of this capacity so it may be relied upon to contribute towards Tower Hamletsâ€™ apportionments prior to permission being granted. 20.32 Integrated waste collection systems are also required for new developments under Policy RW3. We will also consider the allocation of community infrastructure levy contributions towards provision of strategic waste management facilities located elsewhere in the borough.",

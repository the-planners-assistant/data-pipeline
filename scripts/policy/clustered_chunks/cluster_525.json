    "text": "Tower Hamlets Local Plan 121 CLEAN AND GREEN FUTURE 13.64 Where buildings are unable to rely solely on passive cooling measures such as natural ventilation to achieve comfortable conditions due to surrounding pollution or noise levels, mechanical cooling systems will be considered. However, the building should be designed so that, if noise and pollution conditions are resolved in the future, Part O compliance can still be achieved based on passive strategies for domestic buildings and CIBSE TM52 compliance can still be achieved using passive strategies for non-domestic buildings. A full overheating report should be submitted to demonstrate compliance with Part O/ CIBSE TM52 in case of no noise and pollution constraints.",

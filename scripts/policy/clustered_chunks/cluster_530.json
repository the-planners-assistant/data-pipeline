    "text": "388 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO CONTENTS 21.8 The site allocations have been further developed through a design-led site capacity assessment, as set out in the London Plan. This has involved looking at each site allocation in terms of what an appropriate layout, scale, mass, and height would be, and from there determining the capacity of housing and, where appropriate, other uses that could be included on site, taking into account the need to provide infrastructure on site allocations as well. These capacity assessments are intended to set out an appropriate form of development, but are not intended to be entirely prescriptive, and other forms of development may also prove to be acceptable where they meet the requirements of the site allocations, and do not exceed the appropriate heights set out in them.",

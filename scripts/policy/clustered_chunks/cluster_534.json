In combination with advice provided by the HSE, consideration will also be given to site-specific circumstances and any proposed mitigation measures. If the HSE advise against development, planning permission will only be granted in circumstances where it can be demonstrated that the benefits arising from the proposed development would significantly outweigh the potential risks to health and the local environment.",

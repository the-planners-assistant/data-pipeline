    "text": "the development is occupied and demonstrate that sufficient space has been allocated to the storage and/or bulking of this waste in both individual units and for the development as a whole. 20.50 Tower Hamlets is seeking to move away from the traditional waste storage methods, such as standard wheeled bins, bagged collections, and Euro bin containers, towards central bulking systems particularly for residential developments that require communal waste collection facilities. Central bulking system rather than standard bins and communal Euro bins, offer more waste storage which can be stored before needing collection and more waste can be collected in a single round. As a general rule, all of the systems using bulk containers allow waste to be stored in a smaller footprint than standard communal Euro bins. The location of storage containers should be chosen to maximise operational convenience and minimise environmental, amenity and transport impacts.",

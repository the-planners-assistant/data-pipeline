Preferably cycle storage should be located in the vicinity of a more active usage, such as the street or lobby. Indoor cycle storage should be fully accessible for all users, have step-free access via a ramp or direct lift, with suitably wide automated doorways to accommodate all types of cycle. 19.70 Furthermore, short-term cycle parking in key delivery destinations should include provision for accessible cargo-bikes, e-bikes, and e-mopeds (with charging facilities) to support the growth of cycle and last-mile logistics operations.",

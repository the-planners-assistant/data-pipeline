The archaeology of the borough can best be protected if as much information as possible is available at the planning application stage. The evaluation, which may involve fieldwork, is needed so that we can assess the archaeological implications of proposals. Where appropriate, the evaluation may show how developments can be designed so that they do not harm a site of archaeological interest and/or how the remains will be preserved at the site.",

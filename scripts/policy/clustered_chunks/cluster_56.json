    "text": "The design criteria outlined below are defined in the corresponding noise tables. z NOEL – No observed effect level z LOAEL – Lowest observed adverse effect level z SOAEL – Significant observed adverse effect level. The values will vary depending on the context, type of noise and sensitivity of the receptor. z Green – where noise is considered to be at an acceptable level. In this category development is likely to be granted. z Amber – where noise is observed to have an adverse effect level, but which may be considered acceptable when assessed in the context of other merits of the development. In this category permission is likely to be refused unless a good acoustic design process is followed. BACK TO CONTENTS z Red – where noise is observed to have a significant adverse effect. In this category development is likely to be refused. Applicants should seek expert advice on possible noise mitigation measures.",

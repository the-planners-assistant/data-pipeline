    "text": "17.17 The council recognises that in certain circumstances site redevelopment will require the relocation of existing uses to a location where the needs of the users will be more adequately met. To ensure that there is no unacceptable disadvantage to existing users, re-provision of community facilities should be within the relevant catchment area and should result in quality and access improvements, reflecting the principles of active and inclusive design. Proposals should also demonstrate that adequate floorspace in an appropriate configuration is provided to ensure the continued viability of the facility including any amenity space that can be used for wider community BACK TO POLICIES uses, and this should not result in a net loss of floorspace unless justified by demonstrating that the floorspace lost is surplus to need. 17.18 Part 2 seeks to ensure that new development facilitates and promotes greater public access through good and inclusive design and signage.",

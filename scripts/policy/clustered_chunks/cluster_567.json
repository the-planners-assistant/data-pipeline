As such, the council will work together with the Lee Valley Regional Park Authority and the Environment Agency to support proposals set out in the Tower Hamletsâ€™ Local Biodiversity Action Plan and the Park Development Framework where they relate to the borough. We will also work with neighbouring authorities and relevant stakeholders to support the delivery of the Lea River Park (including the Leaway), which connects Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and the Lee Valley Regional Park to the Royal Docks and the River Thames through a new continuous walking and cycling route along the River Lea. Further development principles and guidance are included in the Lea River Park Primer and Lea River Park Design Manual.",

The Water Framework Directive focuses on ensuring good qualitative and quantitative health of water bodies, including reducing and removing pollution, and ensuring there is enough water to support wildlife at the same time as human needs (see Part 1(d). 18.58 Where a Water Framework Directive assessment is required to undertake works on or adjacent to a watercourse, the developer is required to contact the Environment Agency and provide information to demonstrate that the Water Framework Directive objectives can be met or to otherwise justify the development.",

The management plan must show how any potential amenity impacts arising from the proposed development, including noise, odours, fumes, and anti-social behaviour will be mitigated. The management plan should be proportionate to the scale of the proposal and to the type of use being proposed. It may include measures to disperse customers after an event, details of security arrangements to limit anti-social behaviour, proposed hours of operation and methods to limit smoking outside of the building among other matters.",

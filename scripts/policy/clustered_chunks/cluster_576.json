    "text": "17.31 Part 8 supports the use of vacant and meanwhile sites to be utilised for community uses, when it can be shown that the facility is serving an identified need and can be easily accessed. This is a great way of using under-utilised sites to serve a community need, adding life and vibrancy into spaces that would otherwise be vacant and unoccupied. As part of an application for a meanwhile use, the applicant will need to provide a ‘move on’ plan, which makes arrangements for the facility once the development of the site commences. This should demonstrate that the facility can be re-provided elsewhere within the local catchment area, where the facility serves a local need, or within the borough or London more widely where the need is not local. Alternatively, a ‘move on’ plan may not be necessary where the applicant can demonstrate that the need is truly temporary.

    "text": "15.45 Increasing rents and sales costs in Tower Hamlets are making commercial space increasingly unaffordable for the types of businesses and organisations listed above. For this reason, Policy EG3 requires the provision of affordable commercial space in all developments that provide 1,000sqm or more of gross commercial floorspace. Where a development proposal is below this threshold, the council is open to working with developers to secure affordable workspace, particularly in cases where it is necessary to offset harm in relation to another policy. 15.46 In the Strategic Plan 2022-26, the council commits to adopt a community wealth building approach â€“ socially just use of land is a key principle of community wealth building and affordable workspace policy can be used as a mechanism to maximise wider social, economic and community benefits through assets in the borough.",

    "text": "BIODIVERSITY AND OPEN SPACE Supporting text 18.34 This policy aims to ensure that development proposals do not negatively impact the existing network of publicly accessible open space and contributes to its expansion and enhancement. It also seeks to maximise the opportunities for delivery of new open space and for enhancing accessibility and connectivity to the wider network, which is considered crucial to addressing the boroughâ€™s open space deficiency (as shown on Figure 19). 18.35 Development proposals on areas of open space will be resisted unless in the circumstances specified in Part 1. The types of development that are considered to be acceptable in principle within areas of open space include changing rooms, play equipment and seating. They should be of a scale and function proportionate to the open space in which they are to be located and should be purely ancillary to it.",

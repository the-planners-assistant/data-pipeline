    "text": "BACK TO POLICIES 18.29 Some of the borough’s water spaces are difficult to find and access from nearby transport hubs (e.g. River Lea, Shadwell Basin and West India Middle and South Docks) or have restricted and disjointed access (e.g. River Thames). Part 3(c) of the policy seeks to ensure that access to all water spaces is improved through appropriate signage for better way finding. Many of the borough’s water spaces (including Blackwall Basin, Hermitage Basin, Limehouse Basin, East India Dock Basin, Limehouse Cut Canal, Millwall inner and outer docks, Poplar Dock, St Katherine’s Dock, Wapping Canal, West India Docks and the rivers Lea and Thames) are located within or adjacent to areas of open space deficiency. These water spaces and the adjacent land therefore provide important open space functions and make a valuable contribution to the health and well-being of communities.",

Development should maintain the sky space to either side and at the top of the tower to preserve the clear views of Balfron Tower. c. The green and open character within these views should be preserved to enhance the setting of the tower.| |Canada Square Cluster|a. Development should not obstruct the gaps between buildings in the Canada Square Cluster to preserve readability, balance, and aesthetics. b. Development should not interfere with the Canada Square Cluster’s long range views, to preserve Canary Wharf’s distinctive skyline. c. Any future built interventions in Canada Square Park should not have a negative impact on legibility and wayfinding and should enhance the cluster’s identity as a unified landmark.|",

In the case of strategic developments, which can have a significant impact on the local area, the development of design codes can support delivery of new development and encourage public support. They can also ensure that important design elements of a scheme are fully considered at an early stage of development. Some of the site allocations in this plan cover land that is owned by multiple parties, and in these cases a design code produced jointly between these different landowners can ensure that development comes forward in a coordinated manner and help to ensure that proposals on different parts of the allocations can be considered appropriate in design terms PEOPLE, PLACES AND SPACES",

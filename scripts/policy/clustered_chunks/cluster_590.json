Acceptability of proposals for waste management uses in this location will be determined with reference BACK TO POLICIES to policies within the LLDC Local Plan 2020 and any other relevant material considerations that apply to that proposal. Until December 2024 applications for planning permission in these locations will be determined by the LLDC.",

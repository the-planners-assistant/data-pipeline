Additional taller points to the west of Limeharbour along Marsh Wall. Height should step down towards the southern end of the site. z Create a series of buildings scales with a well-articulated built form and skyline, avoiding significant adverse environmental impacts, including overshadowing of adjacent sites either within the area or outside, particularly along the main routes of Marsh Wall and Limeharbour. Massing should be varied so as to avoid creating a canyon-like environment along Marsh Wall. z Protect and enhance the setting of the Maritime Greenwich world heritage site and the historic dockside promenade. Routes and streets z Create a legible, permeable and well-defined movement network",

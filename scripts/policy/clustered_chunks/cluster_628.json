    "text": "14.152 Views are important elements of townscape and local character, and can provide a positive image of the borough, enhance legibility, and increase the pride that residents feel in their local area. Townscape views can be valued for a variety of reasons, but often the most valued views will feature a prominent landmark building that terminates a vista, acts as a focal point, or establishes some other form of spatial hierarchy and ordering. Such landmarks help to define and identify places and are considered to be a key component of high-quality urban design. 14.153 New developments are expected to make a positive contribution to the skyline, including in their use of palette and texture, in particular where these buildings will have an impact on long-distance views. 14.154 This policy identifies a skyline of strategic importance which is observed from multiple locations within and outside the borough, and a series of views and landmarks of a borough-wide importance.",

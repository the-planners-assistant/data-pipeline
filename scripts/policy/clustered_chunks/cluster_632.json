    "text": "BACK TO CONTENTS Routes and streets z Improve walking and cycling connections to, from and within the site. These should align with the existing urban grain to support permeability and access to Thomas More Neighbourhood Centre, St Katharine Docks, Tobacco Dock and the Wapping Canal, and to improve walking and cycling connections across The Highway. Safe access routes to the secondary school are required, and development will need to deliver improved pedestrian and cycling routes. Green grid improvements should be made along Vaughn Way, Pennington Street, and across the eastern edge of the site near Tobacco Dock, and should provide good quality onward connections to the green grid routes at Ensign Street, Artichoke Hill, and the ornamental canal, and to Swedenborg Gardens. Environment and public realm z Provide publicly accessible open space of at least 0.4 hectares in size,",

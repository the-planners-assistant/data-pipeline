    "text": "18.95 Table 12 sets out the factors to be used in calculating the urban greening factor score for developments. This table is based on table 8.2 of the London Plan, but with the following changes: Tower Hamlets Local Plan 335 BIODIVERSITY AND OPEN SPACE z Addition of native wetland vegetation along rivers and canals, to support the rehabilitation and rewilding of the Boroughâ€™s water spaces. z Addition of allotments and growing spaces, to encourage delivery of these kinds of spaces on new developments. These spaces do not provide as high a biodiversity benefit as wetland habitat creation but provide similar benefits to groundcover planting with additional social and community benefits, and have therefore been given a slightly higher factor than groundcover planting. These spaces should ideally be located on ground level, but rooftop growing spaces may also be appropriate where they are made widely accessible to residents and the surrounding community.",

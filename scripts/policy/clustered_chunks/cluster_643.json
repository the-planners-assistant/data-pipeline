    "text": "Tower Hamlets Local Plan 259 TOWN CENTRES 16.17 District Centres (as shown on the Policies Map) generally meet more local needs, with catchments of around 800 metres and provision of convenience goods and services. Typically, they contain around 10,000-50,000 square metres of retail, leisure, and service floorspace. They have high levels of accessibility. They are also generally suitable locations for housing and employment. 16.18 Neighbourhood Centres (as shown on the Policies Map) contain clusters of retail and services to meet the needs of a more local catchment and typically contain at least sixteen units. Units are predominantly small-in-scale, with convenience supermarkets of around 500 square metres tending to be the largest occupants. Larger neighbourhood centres may also be appropriate for some leisure and night-time economy uses.",

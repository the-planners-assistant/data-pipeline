    "text": "18.88 Under part 6, ‘potentially invasive non-native species’ includes plants listed on Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) and plants identified as species of concern by the London Invasive Species Initiative and those listed as ‘species of special UK concern’ within (IAS) (Enforcement and Permitting) Order 2019. Some plants that are regularly used in horticulture produce nectar that is toxic to bees. These include several non-native species of lime trees. These species should not be included in the landscaping of development. In addition, planting schemes should be selected according to their suitability for local growing conditions (soil, temperature ranges, rainfall, periods of inundation, sunlight and shade), their ability to attract wildlife (e.g. nectar rich planting) and to conserve water. Planting along river corridors should only include native species. This will need to be evidenced in the ecology statement.",

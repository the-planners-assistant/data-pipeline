    "text": "Policy CG8 Water efficient design 1. Development proposals are required to reduce mains water consumption through efficiency and substitution measures. This should be achieved by: a. new major residential development proposals must achieve a maximum mains water use of 80 litres per person per day for internal use, plus an additional 5 litres per person per day where external green space is provided; b. making use of fittings with water consumption below those listed in Building Regulations Part G table 2.2; c. domestic refurbishment must meet all BREEAM water efficiency credits; d. non-domestic development and refurbishment should earn at least 75% of available BREEAM water efficiency credits; and e. major development proposals that can demonstrate they are unable to meet the above targets on site must make a financial contribution to the council to offset the shortfall elsewhere.",

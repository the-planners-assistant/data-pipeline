Such measures should be proportionate to the risk and must be in conformity with other policies in this plan, including those relating to access to the transport and active travel networks, access to water spaces, and to heritage conservation. Where such proposals are to be put forward, discussions should be opened with planning officers at the earliest opportunity, to ensure that measures can be implemented appropriately. 184 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO POLICIES 14.97 Part 5 promotes the activation of spaces under the DLR viaducts, to include them into the network of public realm and ensure connectivity between areas across the line.

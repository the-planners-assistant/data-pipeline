Minor developments that are exempt from mandatory BNG are still expected to deliver biodiversity enhancement in line with the Local Biodiversity Action Plan, appropriate to the scale of the development, but need not use the Defra Biodiversity Metric. Further guidance can be found in the Mayor of London’s Biodiversity Net Gain SPG. It should be noted that simply delivering the required BNG is not sufficient justification for developers to argue for an ‘acceptable’ loss of good quality habitat.",

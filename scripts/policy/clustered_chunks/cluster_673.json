    "text": "20.51 Under part 2 of the policy, new major residential developments will be expected to incorporate on-site waste collection systems that are compatible with waste collection services. Such systems could include compactors, underground storage containers, vacuum systems, and automated waste collection systems. These systems require land to be set aside to store bulked waste materials, with the size and footprint varying from system to system. Preference should be given to systems that can provide for a weekly collection service as a minimum and allow separate collection of organic wastes or facilitate onsite processing of organics. Applicants should discuss options with the waste management team prior to the submission of an application. Food waste, household waste and recyclables must be separated to allow independent collection and onward management. BACK TO POLICIES",

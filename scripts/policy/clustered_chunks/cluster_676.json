    "text": "16.55 Within Neighbourhood Parades and non-designated locations, proposals involving food and drink uses should be of a more modest scale than might be expected in larger town centres. Applicants should robustly state why a café, restaurant or drinking establishment would be appropriate in such a location. Details of any other cafés, restaurants or drinking establishments in the local area should also be provided to mitigate the risk of clusters developing that could undermine nearby town centres. In respect of drinking establishments, a detailed management plan should be submitted alongside the planning application confirming that it will be run as a ‘community’ public house and that conflicts with neighbouring properties would be avoided. Applicants would also be encouraged to consider our statement of licensing policy.",

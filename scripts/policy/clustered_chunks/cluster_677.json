    "text": ". The Specialist Centres are town centres equivalent in scale to neighbourhood centres, but that include a unique cluster of businesses that attract visitors from a wider area. For the purposes of employment uses, Columbia Road should be treated as a neighbourhood centre. Redchurch Street includes small-scale offices that complement the ground floor uses, including creative businesses. New office development that supports the existing mix of uses will be supported. Hackney Wick includes a mix of town centre uses alongside light industrial and residential uses. Development of light industrial uses that are compatible with the existing mix of uses will generally be supported. Neighbourhood Centres serve the day-to-day needs of a smaller catchment and are likely to be suitable for more localised office uses.|",

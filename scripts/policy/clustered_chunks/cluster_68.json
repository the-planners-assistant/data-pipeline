Spaces that are privately owned can still form part of the public realm, if they are accessible to the public.| |Public square||A consolidated area of open space primarily used by pedestrians, which should include well-defined edges and active frontages. It should be multifunctional and suitable for gatherings and should be well integrated with the wider movement network. The precise shape/form of the public square will be determined through the development management process.|",

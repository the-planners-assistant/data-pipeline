The council is required to have a positive strategy for understanding and conserving important aspects of our heritage, and the borough’s Conservation Strategy sets out a clear vision that recognises and embeds the role of heritage in planning and design. This policy therefore reflects the Conservation Strategy, by setting out the parameters within which development can sustainably take place while also preserving the most important parts of the borough’s heritage. The importance of heritage needs to be balanced with the borough’s other needs, including the need to provide good-quality housing and reduce overcrowding, and this policy sets out a proportionate response to this challenge.",

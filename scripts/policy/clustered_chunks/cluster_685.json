As per the Tower Hamlets Electric Vehicle Delivery Plan (2021-2025) accelerating the switch to electric vehicles will require potential users to feel confident that there is an adequate number of charging points and that are conveniently located to meet their needs. Passive provision is not considered appropriate, as there is no longer a question of if or when the demand for EV charge points will increase. Responsibility for installing them should be taken on now, to avoid dispute in the future over who has responsibility for upgrading all car parking spaces in development.

    "text": "20.24 Meeting this need will require the management of waste arising from new development to be provided for, retention of existing waste management facilities (operational and non-operational), and provision of additional facilities in identified Areas of Search and other suitable locations which comply with the criteria set out in Policy RW2 (and the development management criteria contained in this Local Plan). Proposals for waste management facilities within the Areas of Search will be guided towards locations within these areas so they are located as far away as possible from sensitive receptors (such as residential uses, schools, nurseries, and healthcare facilities) and mitigation measures are provided to ensure any significant detrimental environmental and amenity impacts are adequately addressed. Where existing facilities can be enhanced to maximise their use, subject to the requirements of Policy RW2, this will be encouraged.",

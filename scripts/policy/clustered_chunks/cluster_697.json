Development proposals must protect and enhance biodiversity and contribute to nature recovery in the borough through: a. protecting and retaining existing habitats and features of biodiversity value. If this is not possible, these features must be replaced within the development, and additional measures must be incorporated to enhance biodiversity, proportionate to the development proposed; b. maximising the provision of ‘living building’ elements to provide opportunities to create new onsite habitats, including integral nest boxes; and c. demonstrating that the development does not have an adverse impact on open spaces, including watercourses and water bodies and their hydrology.",

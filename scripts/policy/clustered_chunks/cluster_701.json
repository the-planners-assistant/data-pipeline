Development proposals adjacent to and along the borough’s water spaces are required to integrate with and enhance the waterside environment, including improving the area’s links with the water space, contribute to the delivery of continuous walkways, canal towpaths and cycle paths where appropriate (e.g. completion of the Thames Path), and consider flood defence raising and the management of historic wharves in line with TE2100 riverside strategy approach. 3. Development proposals for eco-moorings will be considered acceptable at suitable locations, and where they do not cause any adverse impact on navigation, biodiversity, microclimate, safety, amenity of surrounding residents and the public enjoyment of the water space.

    "text": "|St Anne’s Church|a. The massing around the intersection of Commercial Road and West India Dock Road should be designed in a way that preserves and frames views to the church tower above the trees. b. Heights on Salmon Lane should remain low to accentuate the views of the church with Canary Wharf in the background.| |St George- in-the-East Church|a. Heights along Chigwell Hill, Wapping Lane, and The Highway should remain low to maintain and frame views to the church tower and turrets. b. Building frontages on The Highway should be articulated to contrast the large composed southern façade of the church and to complement the historic terraces on Cable Street to the north.| |East London Mosque|a. Future development along Whitechapel Road should consider an articulated massing to avoid overwhelming the mosque. b. Massing should respect views to the minarets to protect their visibility.|",

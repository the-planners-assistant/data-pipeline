TfL provides guidance that sets out the requirements for travel plans. Such plans must promote and provide a long-term strategy to meet sustainable transport objectives. They should contain a package of measures that will seek to minimise the number of trips undertaken by private car (e.g. restricting car parking provision), encourage use of sustainable transport and generally reduce the need to travel to and from the development. Travel plans must set targets, objectives and provide detail on implementation, funding, and monitoring. This will be secured as a planning obligation for major development proposals and as a condition on minor development proposals.",

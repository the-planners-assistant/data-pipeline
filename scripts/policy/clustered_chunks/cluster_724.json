However, further infrastructure investment will be required to accommodate the predicted population and employment growth, and in some locations development could be significantly hindered without appropriate enhancements to the transport network. There is a particular need to invest in active, efficient, and sustainable transport infrastructure, to make the most efficient use of space in a rapidly growing borough, and ensure that those who are still required to drive for employment, caring, or family reasons are able to do so.",

The council will expect development proposals to maximise opportunities for the provision of high-quality community facilities, designed to maximise adaptability and flexibility to offer a mix of different functions to serve a wide range of users. Where possible, facilities or services should be accessible to the wider community outside of core hours and co-located or shared to encourage multipurpose trips and best meet the needs of different groups and delivering social value to the community. 4. New community facilities will be directed towards the boroughâ€™s centres in accordance with the town centre hierarchy and/or to locations which are accessible to their catchments depending on the nature and scale of the proposal. 5. The council will expect strategic development proposals for residential development to deliver a community facility on-site, where evidence demonstrates a need for the local area.

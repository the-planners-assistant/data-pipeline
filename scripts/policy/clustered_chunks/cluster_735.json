Reuse, recycling and waste RW1 – Managing our waste RW2 – New and enhanced waste facilities RW3 – Waste collection facilities in new development Introduction 20.1 The management of waste is one of the most challenging issues facing Tower Hamlets. To address this the council has brought the collection and management of household waste under its direct control, declared a waste emergency and developed a detailed management strategy for local authority collected waste. The borough will continue to have significant population and development growth in the coming decades and this is expected to give rise to a growing quantity of waste to be managed, from homes, businesses and construction work. The council wants to ensure that as much of this waste as possible is, reused, recycled, and has value extracted from it while facilitating a shift towards a circular economy where the quantity of waste produced falls.",

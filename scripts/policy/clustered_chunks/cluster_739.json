As the demand for traditional retail has diminished, restaurants, cafes, bars, and pubs are increasingly acting as anchors and Metropolitan attractors to town centres. These businesses can also play an important role in supporting their local communities. Cafes and pubs provide spaces for local residents, workers, students and visitors to meet and socialise. They also often host events and provide space for formal community meetings. Restaurants can often reflect the diverse backgrounds of the local community and establish a sense of place within a town centre. This is evident in all the boroughâ€™s town centres, but especially in Brick Lane, where the South Asian restaurants are a key element in the character of the high street and attract visitors from across London and beyond. Food and drink businesses are encouraged to support and reflect the diverse communities within their local areas.",

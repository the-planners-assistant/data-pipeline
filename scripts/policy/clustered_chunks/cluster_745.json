    "text": "2. New development proposals should use zero emissions vehicles for servicing wherever possible and consolidated deliveries are expected to be of this type. Servicing by cycle and other non-motor vehicular modes should be used wherever possible. Any loading bay required for a development should be supplied with an electric vehicle rapid charge point to allow zero emissions vehicles to operate from the bay. 3. Development proposals that generate a significant number of vehicle trips for goods or materials during its construction and/or operational phases are required to submit a Construction Logistics Plan and/ or Delivery and Servicing Plan as part of the transport assessment. This should demonstrate how: a. impact to the transport network and amenity will be avoided, remedied or mitigated; b. delivery of goods and servicing will be provided within the site to encourage shared arrangements and timing of deliveries;",

These are areas that have been identified as having high levels of pollution and human exposure, as shown on Figure 8. The AQFAs are reviewed periodically based on LAEI data, and may be subject to change in the future. 13.117 Part 1 requires large-scale development proposals and major development within Air Quality Focus Areas to adopt an ‘air quality positive’ approach. Air Quality Positive is a process of identifying and implementing methods to push development proposals beyond air quality neutral standards, as set out in the Air Quality Positive LPG (2023). Developments will be required to submit an Air Quality Positive statement as part of the Air Quality Assessment, in line with GLA 21 Tower Hamlets Joint Strategic Needs Assessment: Strategic Planning and Health (2016) 22 London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI) (GLA, 2019)",

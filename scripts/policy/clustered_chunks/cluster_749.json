In the case of a change of use from a use for which a heritage asset was originally designed, it must be clearly demonstrated that any harm to the significance of the heritage asset caused by the new use, or by any changes to the building fabric required to implement the new use, is justified when weighed against the public benefits of the proposal, including the benefit of securing the optimum viable use. 8. Proposals for development within a conservation area (as shown on the policies map) or its setting must: a. preserve or enhance those elements (including unlisted buildings) which make a positive contribution to the special character or appearance of the conservation area; b. make a positive contribution to local character and the distinctiveness of the conservation area; and c. explore opportunities for new development to enhance or better reveal the significance of the conservation area.",

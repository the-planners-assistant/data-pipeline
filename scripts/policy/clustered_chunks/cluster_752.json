Development proposals that involve the redevelopment of existing occupied workspace, even where there is no net loss of employment floorspace, will not be supported unless: a. the workspace is provided with equivalent layout, fit-out and rent levels based on that which has been lost and existing tenants are given the right of first refusal for the re-provided space; and proposals provide a decanting plan to ensure that the businesses can continue to operate during the construction phase, including finding suitable temporary accommodation, at equivalent rents, within the borough unless it can be shown that the needs of the business are better met elsewhere; or b. the development proposal identifies alternative space with a size, layout, rent and connectivity equivalent to the existing that is available and considered suitable by the occupier. The alternative space should be located within the borough unless it can be shown that the needs of the business are better met",

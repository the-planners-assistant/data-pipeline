This is primarily due to their industrial nature and access to the strategic transport network so that waste and vehicle movements can avoid local roads and protect the safety and amenity of residents and heritage assets. Areas of search are not exclusively designated for waste management purposes as they are also considered to be suitable, in principle, for other uses that are considered appropriate for their respective policy designations.",

    "text": "|Open space (consolidated)||A process of combining open space into a single more effective or coherent whole. The way in which these spaces will function will be assessed on a site-by-site basis and agreed through the development management process. At sites with multiple-ownership, this will mean that each site has to deliver their proportion of open space adjoining the open space which the adjoining landowner will deliver, or deliver it in such a way that the open space would still form a coherent whole over the entire site allocation. We strongly encourage landowners to work jointly to develop masterplans covering the entire site allocation to ensure consolidation can be achieved whilst balancing the impact on the landowners. Consolidation should also avoid fragmentation of open space and ensure that it fulfils the qualities and function of open space set out in the Open Space Strategy.|",

Development should incorporate and improve pedestrian and cycling environment that is safe, accessible, and permeable both within the borough and into neighbouring boroughs. It also identifies the necessity to link development to the borough’s pedestrian networks, such as the Green Grid network and Thames Path, and strategic cycling networks, and improve access to river transport where possible, in accordance with the borough’s Transport Strategy (2019).",

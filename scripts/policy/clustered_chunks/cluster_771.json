In addition to setting minimum UGF requirements, the London Plan allows boroughs to develop a tailored approach to the factors set out in that policy to encourage amenity space, enhance biodiversity, address the urban heat island effect, and provide sustainable storm water drainage. 18.92 The London Plan explains that the urban greening factor for a proposed development is calculated using the formula: (Factor A x Area) + (Factor B x Area) + (Factor C, D, etc x Area) / Total Site Area",

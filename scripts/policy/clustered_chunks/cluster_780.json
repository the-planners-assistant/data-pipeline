    "text": "REUSE, RECYCLING AND WASTE Supporting text 20.47 Part 1 of this policy will help to ensure that waste is collected and managed in a sustainable manner in line with the principles of the Tower Hamletsâ€™ waste management hierarchy as set out in Figure 22. It is also intended to increase the amount of waste recycled and composted from all developments, and to improve waste collection systems in developments with communal waste facilities in particular. Tower Hamlets is working towards meeting the London Plan target of recycling 65% of municipal waste by 2030 and zero biodegradable waste to landfill by 2026. The volume of household waste that was reused, recycled, or composted in Tower Hamlets needs to increase to meet these targets and ensuring the required facilities are provided in new developments will help move towards and meet these targets.",

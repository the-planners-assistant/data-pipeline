    "text": "z The operations of Billingsgate Market should be appropriately re provided at a suitable location within London. z The site is within the Canary Wharf Fringe and is expected to provide at least 25% of the floorspace as commercial uses, with a focus on Central Activities Zone strategic uses as defined in the London Plan. z Proposals on this site should be in accordance with the principles of the South Poplar Masterplan SPD. This has been developed between landowners and the council in order to positively address the social, economic and environmental disparities between Poplar and Canary Wharf. z An assessment should be carried out to understand the potential contamination on site prior to any development taking place.",

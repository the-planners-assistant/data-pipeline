Canary Wharf has been designated a Metropolitan Centre because it serves a wide catchment which extends over several boroughs and into parts of the wider south-east region. It contains at least 100,000 square metres of retail, leisure and service floorspace with a significant proportion of higher-order comparison goods relative to convenience goods. Canary Wharf has very good accessibility and significant employment, service and leisure functions.| |Metropolitan Open Land||Strategic open land within the urban area that contributes to the structure of London and has the same protection as the Green Belt.| |Mixed-use development||Development for a variety of activities on single sites or across wider areas such as town centres.|",

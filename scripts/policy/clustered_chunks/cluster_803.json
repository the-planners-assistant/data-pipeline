Development proposals that are designed for a specific operator or a specific industrial use may not be able to provide flexibility or smaller units. Site constraints may also limit the ability of a development proposal to meet these criteria. 15.38 Part 7(c) promotes a working environment that supports the health and well-being of occupants. Development proposals should demonstrate that they include adequate levels of daylight and sunlight and access to ancillary communal facilities for smaller occupiers such as meeting rooms, breakout spaces, and kitchen facilities. 15.39 Part 7(d) seeks to ensure that the delivery and servicing needs of the occupiers can be met within the proposed development.",

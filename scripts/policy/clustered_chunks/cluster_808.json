    "text": "12.81 The council will monitor the pipeline of existing and consented LSPBSL schemes to determine their concentration across the borough and identify areas which could be subject to an overconcentration impacting upon balanced and mixed communities. 12.82 Additionally, information setting out existing and planned infrastructure within the vicinity of the development proposal will help inform understanding of how part 1(e) has been addressed. 12.83 In accordance with the London Plan, development proposals for LSPBSL are assessed on the basis that 1.8 bedrooms are equivalent to 1 standard C3 dwelling. On that basis, as all LSPBSL developments have at least 50 bedrooms, they are all considered major development, and will be expected to provide affordable housing on-site or a cash-in-lieu contribution equivalent to the delivery of 50% affordable housing, in line with parts 2(a) and (b).",

    "text": "CLEAN AND GREEN FUTURE 13.115 Air quality modelling from the London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI) 2019 shows that the most polluting roads in the borough are along the arterial roads, including the A13, the Blackwall Tunnel Approach and the Highway. In these areas, the levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulates (PM2.5 and PM 10) exceed WHO 2005 air quality guideline limits and, in the case of nitrogen dioxide, European Union safe legal limits /national air quality objectives. [25] The London Environment Strategy (2018) sets commitments to meet the WHO health-based interim guideline limits across London by 2030. In 2021 the WHO issued more stringent guidelines for particulate air pollution, and the council aspires to meet the updated guideline values for PM2.5 in the shortest possible timeframe.",

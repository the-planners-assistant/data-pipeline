    "text": "13.87 To reduce the amount of water being discharged from sites, this policy requires development proposals to reduce the run-off from all impermeable finishes. When assessing the requirements of this policy, consideration will be given to the size, scale, and nature of the development and whether relative provision has been made. Even minor developments (e.g. rear extensions) have the ability to provide sustainable drainage measures. This policy also anticipates that Schedule 3 of the Flood and Water Management Act is expected to come into force in 2024, and will introduce a mandatory requirement for development proposals to implement SuDS.",

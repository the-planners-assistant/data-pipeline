    "text": "14.156 Part 1(b) refers to the group of tall buildings around Canary Wharf that form a distinctive cluster, referred to as the ‘skyline of strategic PEOPLE, PLACES AND SPACES importance’ (SSI). This cluster is visible across London and has become a globally recognised silhouette. The distinctive skyline is a prominent and recognisable feature in views from the surrounding areas, which are of a much smaller scale. The area of skyline of strategic importance covers the Canary Wharf tall buildings zone (zone B), as shown on the policies map and set out in Policy PS2. Building heights within the designation area should highlight the central emphasis of the SSI at One Canada Square, to ensure a consistent and coherent skyline. The heights in the setting of the skyline of strategic importance should be consistent and significantly lower than the buildings at the edge of the designation area.",

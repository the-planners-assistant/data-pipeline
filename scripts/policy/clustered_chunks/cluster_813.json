    "text": "11.50 A monetary contribution to cover the monitoring of planning obligations will be secured. This will be calculated on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the nature of the proposed development, obligations secured, and the estimated cost of monitoring. 11.51 Financial contributions may be sought financially or ‘in kind’ – BACK TO POLICIES where the developer builds or directly provides the matters necessary to fulfil the obligation negotiated as part of the planning application. Where provision is made within developments, this will be credited to the scheme and may offset financial contributions that may otherwise be sought. In-kind delivery of planning obligations will be at the discretion of the council and only in appropriate circumstances.",

This can be achieved through design-led site optimisation which seeks to ensure that development makes the best use of land through the consideration of design options, determining the most appropriate density and form of development for the site’s context, capacity for growth and connections to jobs, services, infrastructure, and amenities. 11.9 Part 3 of the policy highlights the council’s prioritisation of affordable housing delivery in the borough and the need for development to comply with the affordable housing policies of the Local Plan to alleviate the large-scale levels of overcrowding and lack of affordable housing in the borough.

There is a particular need to avoid physical and visual clutter in the streetscape as well as problems arising from distraction among road users and pedestrians. For instance, the location of A boards in areas where the width of the footway is less than 2 metres will be resisted. Poster panels/freestanding adverts will generally be out of place within residential areas due to their scale, size, and intrusive nature. 14.175 External illumination for signage will need to be carefully considered at an early stage in the design process to ensure that lighting can be sensitively incorporated, where required.

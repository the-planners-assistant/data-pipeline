However, specific objectives, policies and guidance contained in, and informing the Plan, may be considered outdated, particularly due to changes in national and regional guidance, in particular the London Plan (2021), new Levelling Up & Regeneration Act and the National Planning Policy Framework (December 2023). 2.3 Of particular importance is ensuring that a new Local Plan for the borough best responds to the needs and aspirations of the local community, responding to the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and cost of living pressures, and providing the best opportunity for local residents to thrive in Tower Hamlets.",

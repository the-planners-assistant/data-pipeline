    "text": "82 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO POLICIES reflect the full scale of the overall development, rather than the uplift proposed in the MMA application. In development proposals for the construction of additions or extensions that result in new dwellings being added to existing buildings, an affordable housing contribution will be sought based on the number of new dwellings being proposed. 12.39 Part 7 of the policy reflects the particularly high need for larger, family-sized units in the affordable rental tenure. This is to address an urgent need for larger units to combat the impacts of overcrowding, and may be reviewed later in the plan period. While a unit mix is not prescribed for market and intermediate dwellings, there should be a healthy mix (at least 15% 3 bed+ units), and developments weighted towards studios and one-bedroom units in these tenures will be resisted",

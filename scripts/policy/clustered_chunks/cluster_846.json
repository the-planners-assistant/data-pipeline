    "text": "13.91 Part 2 also seeks to address where a development, refurbishment or change of use will increase foul drainage, this will be balanced with reduction of surface water run-off to ensure that discharge to the combined sewerage network will not increase. 13.92 To satisfy the requirements of Part 5, surface water reduction and the required run-off rates should be achieved by following the sustainable drainage systems hierarchy, which is outlined in the London Plan. Infiltration SuDS techniques should only dispose of clean surface water into suitable ground and include stages of the SuDS treatment train as required. They should not be used for foul discharges or trade effluent, and may not be suitable within source protection zone 161 (as defined by the Environment Agency).",

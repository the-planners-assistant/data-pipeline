    "text": "from the street level. 14.160 Part 1(f) seeks to shape and manage the impact that development would have on townscape and local views that are important to the identity of Tower Hamlets and its unique places. These will be identified on a case-by-case basis through the townscape and visual impact analysis in relation to a particular development. Due to relatively flat topography, tall buildings located in the borough can be seen from significant distances. It is therefore important that tall buildings positively contribute to the legibility, character, and spatial structure of the borough’s 24 places. 14.161 Part 2 sets out principles for development within close proximity to the borough-designated landmarks or within their sightlines. These principles have been derived from the Views and Landmarks Study developed as part of the plan’s evidence base, and ensure that views of these important landmarks will be protected.

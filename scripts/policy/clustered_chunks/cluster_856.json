Building heights in this zone should step down towards the southern edge of this zone. c. An appropriate height for taller points in this zone is between 60-80m AOD. Appropriate heights on individual sites will be dependent upon the impact on heritage assets and their settings, including the protected view of the Tower of London from the Queenâ€™s Walk. Development must protect this view, and this may lead to a limitation of building heights on particular sites where this is necessary to preserve the view and the outstanding universal value of the Tower of London.|",

The scope or necessity of the components a utility statement can be determined as a result of such engagement with the council. 11.71 Part 1(b) requires strategic development proposals to engage with utilities providers at the earliest opportunity in the design and construction process. This includes water supply, wastewater drainage and the SuDS Approval Body, electricity and energy including heat network operators, digital connectivity, and mobile communications. Development proposals should be supported by evidence of this engagement.

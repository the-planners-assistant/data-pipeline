As such, the delivery of student accommodation needs to be managed in accordance with strategic needs and local priorities, ensuring that the positive impacts it can bring to the local economy and the boroughâ€™s higher education sector is combined with the delivery of the affordable homes and infrastructure the residents of LBTH need.",

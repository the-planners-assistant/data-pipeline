Development proposals for new community facilities will be directed towards the identified town centre locations. Development proposals involving the provision of community facilities located outside the boroughâ€™s town centres will be supported where an up-to-date and robust local need can be demonstrated. 2. Development proposals for new community facilities should demonstrate that early consultation has been undertaken with the intended operator and users of the space. All community facilities must be culturally sensitive and reflect the needs of the diverse communities living in the borough. This should include evidence of a co-design process to ensure the new facility best meets the needs of the local community.",

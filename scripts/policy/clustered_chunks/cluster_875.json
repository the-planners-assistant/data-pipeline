It is common for the actual energy performance of a building to fail to meet the design standard, which is known as ‘the performance gap’. Part 4 requires development proposals to use an assured performance method to demonstrate that the performance gap has been minimised. The assured performance method must be recognised by an accredited industry body. This includes (but is not limited to) the Passivhaus standard, the Building Energy Performance Improvement Toolkit (BEPIT), and the Association for Environment Conscious Building (AECB) standard. Other standards may be used with agreement of the council.",

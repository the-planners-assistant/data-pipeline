Form, massing, and heritage z Height Strategy: Appropriate height of 43m at the tallest point, which should be located towards the centre of the site, between White Post Lane and Rothbury Road. An additional taller point with an appropriate height of 33m should be located on the Queen’s yard site, with heights stepping down around these higher points. z The impact of development on nearby conservation areas should be considered – heritage assets should be protected or enhanced, and any negative impacts mitigated, because heritage and historic conservation plays a vital role in benefitting place shaping, social cohesion and the economy. For further details, refer to the Tower Hamlets Conservation Strategy and relevant Conservation Area Character Appraisals.",

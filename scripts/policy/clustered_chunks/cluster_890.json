    "text": ".|The Tower Hamlets Activity Areas act as zones of transition between the high-density, business-oriented environments of the CAZ and Canary Wharf and the nearby residential communities. They typically include a mix of uses, including office, light industrial and residential and are generally suitable for mixed-use development including residential. District Centres serve the day-to-day needs of a large catchment area and can accommodate office development, typically at a smaller scale than the POLs, CAZ and Canary Wharf Fringe. These centres can also often accommodate light industrial uses away from the main shopping streets, where they support the vitality and viability of the centre (see town centre policies for more details). The Specialist Centres are town centres equivalent in scale to neighbourhood centres, but that include a unique cluster of businesses that attract visitors from a wider area",

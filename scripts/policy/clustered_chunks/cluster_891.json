    "text": "12.34 The provision of affordable housing will be calculated using habitable rooms as it ensures the provision of a range of housing sizes more likely to meet the needs identified in the latest housing needs assessment. Any variation on aggregate floorspace across both bedroom mix and tenure should be presented in the accommodation schedule. BACK TO POLICIES 12.35 Part 4 expects affordable housing to be delivered on-site. This is important in promoting mixed and inclusive communities. In exceptional circumstances, specific site constraints may require that affordable housing is provided off-site or through payments in lieu. These cases give rise to particular policy requirements to maximise the provision of affordable housing. Payments in lieu towards affordable housing will be secured by planning obligation.",

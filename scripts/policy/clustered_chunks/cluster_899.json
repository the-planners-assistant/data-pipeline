Heritage elements of shopfronts should be retained and enhanced in line with policy PS6, and should provide active frontages onto streets in line with policy PS4. Shopfronts which form part of a group of original shopfronts and/or are designated heritage assets or within conservation areas should be of a traditional design and incorporate traditional features and character, and use traditional materials. Such developments should avoid the use of neon lighting, animated electronic displays, and external solid shutters.",

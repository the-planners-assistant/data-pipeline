For example, an over-reliance on opening windows as a passive cooling method would not be appropriate as the only source to mitigate heating in areas of high air pollution and noise pollution, or near existing industrial uses. It may also pose safety risks to ground floor uses. Likewise, design interventions to mitigate overheating which limit natural daylight and sunlight, such as reducing size or quantity of windows, should be avoided, and balanced with cumulative impact to a buildingâ€™s users.

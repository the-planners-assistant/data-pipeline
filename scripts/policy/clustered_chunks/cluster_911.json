    "text": "12.12 Part 1(e) recognises that the borough contains a stock of vacant and derelict homes. In order to meet housing needs, it will be essential to bring these homes back into use. Grants are available from the council to allow owners to carry out works to homes to bring them back into use, and council tax penalties are imposed on homes that have been left empty for more than two years. 12.13 Part 1(f) regarding housing as a temporary meanwhile use, will be supported in locations which are appropriate for residential development and meet the requirements of all applicable policies. The temporary use of land for residential purposes is supported by London Plan Policy H3 (Meanwhile use as housing). It is expected that such developments will be time limited to ensure that the long-term intended use of a site is ultimately delivered.",

    "text": "14.49 Part 7 sets out specific principles for the tall building zones in the borough. Within these zones, tall buildings will be considered acceptable in principle, but it is still necessary to have some principles for how they are delivered, to ensure that clusters of tall buildings work harmoniously together, present a positive image of the borough, and do not have negative impacts in terms of microclimate, daylight/sunlight, heritage, or townscape. These principles will allow the council to assess proposals within the tall building zones and determine whether they are of appropriate height within the context.",

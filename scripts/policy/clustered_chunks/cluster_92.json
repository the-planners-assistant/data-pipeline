The design and layout of buildings influences exposure to poor air quality. Wider sustainable design principles that reduce energy use and APPENDIX 6 demand also reduce the potential emissions from buildings, and involve energy efficiency measures, retrofitting where appropriate, pollution control and urban greening. The remaining energy demand is therefore more likely to be met using zero- or low-emission sources. 1.2.1 Form, layout, and orientation",

Part 2 of the policy specifies that this document must be considered as part of any proposal with a density of 1,100 habitable rooms per hectare or above. However, developments that are high density but below this threshold are also encouraged to consider the provisions of this document as part of the design-led process, as it includes ‘best practice’ guidance that can help to ensure that the proposal is acceptable in design terms.",

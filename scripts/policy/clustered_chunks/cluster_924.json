    "text": "PEOPLE, PLACES AND SPACES 14.18 Part 4 sets out the requirement for an assessment of the impacts on infrastructure as a result of the proposed development. The Local Plan and supporting evidence base, sets out the infrastructure to support the amount of development identified in the Plan over the period to 2038. Part 4 of this policy identifies circumstances that will increase the amount of development beyond what is planned for, and hence it is necessary for such proposals to identify how they will mitigate the additional impacts created. Infrastructure impact assessments are therefore required for allocated sites that exceed allocated capacities or heights, but also on unallocated sites that are delivering above the 500home threshold used to assess site allocations. In addition, proposals for tall buildings outside of site allocations that are expected to exceed the height limits set out in policy PS2 will also be expected to submit infrastructure impact assessments.",

GLA developed products (including the London Affordable Rent and London Living Rent) may be subject to change over the plan period. Our affordable housing service will provide further guidance on suitable products when assessing applications. Rent levels are determined as part of the viability assessment of each planning application and undertakings are made to retain similar rent levels at the point of completion. The ownership of affordable homes must be transferred to one of our approved local registered providers or other approved affordable housing providers.",

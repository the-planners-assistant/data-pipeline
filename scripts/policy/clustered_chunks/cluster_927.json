Having monitored sea level rise, the Environment Agency has moved the earlier deadline forward by 15 years to accommodate the higher level of rise that has occurred, when compared with what was modelled when the Plan was first produced. Further changes are anticipated as the effects of climate change manifest themselves. It is clear though, that the raising of defences will have significant implications for riparian owners and the environment and development adjacent to rivers. A Riverside Strategy will be developed before 2034 and detail approaches to defence raising, including the defences provided to historic wharves.",

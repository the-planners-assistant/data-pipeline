    "text": "13.18 New buildings must be designed and constructed to net zero carbon standards to enable the council to meet its ambitious zero carbon targets. All new buildings should be designed and built to be net zero carbon in operation, with ultra-low levels of total energy use and space heating demand. These recommendations are in line with recommendations of the Climate Change Committee (CCC), the London Energy Transformation Initiative (LETI) and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) [13] . Development proposals which do not demonstrate how net zero carbon will be achieved will not be supported.",

    "text": "110 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO POLICIES 13.24 Part 2(b) Sets out different targets for non-domestic buildings based on their use, based on extensive predictive energy modelling within the Delivering Net Zero study (2023). Non-domestic buildings include warehouse and industrial, schools, office, retail, and HE facilities, GP surgeries, and hotels. Where a non-domestic development does not have an applicable category of use outlined in the policy, the applicant should discuss with the council to identify an appropriate EUI target. 13.25 Part 2(b) (vi) sets the EUI target for hotels at 160 kWh/m2 GIA/ yr. This is higher than the EUI set out in the GLA Energy Assessment Guidance. This can be attributed to the high energy consumption per m2 in hotels due to high catering loads and domestic hot water usage. An updated target has been recommended in the Delivering Net Zero study (2023), which will drive energy and fabric efficiency in hotel design.",

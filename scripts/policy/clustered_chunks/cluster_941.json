Within this zone, proposals should consist of or provide a significant amount of employment floorspace or other strategic CAZ uses relative to the surrounding context of the site. Other uses which may include residential will be encouraged where the residential component of a scheme does not exceed 75% of the gross internal floor area. This will ensure that the area retains its mixed-use character, and that smaller-scale office space continues to be provided that meets the needs of local independent businesses in highly accessible locations.",

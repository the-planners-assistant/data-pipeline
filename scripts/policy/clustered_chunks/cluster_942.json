    "text": "19.34 Part 3(e) requires developments to be inclusive-by-design, considering the needs, comfort, accessibility, and safety of all users. Safety can be described as a spectrum of exclusion, which can be experienced in the form of mild inconvenience, significant discomfort, to severe danger. This is more commonly experienced by women, girls, and gender diverse people; from the inconvenience of having to carry pushchairs and small children up flights of stairs, or struggling to find a public bathroom; or feeling uncomfortable taking certain routes home at night, to being threatened by verbal harassment and physical violence.The intersection of marginalised identities can compound and exacerbate experiences of exclusion from the public realm, while also considering that the lived experiences of women, girls, and gender diverse people is incredibly varied. Ultimately, streets that are inclusiveby-design will improve the experiences, comfort, and safety for all users.",

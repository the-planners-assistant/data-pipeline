We will celebrate the vibrant history and urban landscape of Tower Hamlets through thoughtful design and placemaking, highlighting our rich, historic, and significant character areas. Tower Hamlets will emerge from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit to maintain its status as an international hub for business, culture, and tourism. Our unique location, with strong links to the City of London, Stratford, London City Airport, and beyond, will allow for a rich mix of strategic functions that benefit the community.",

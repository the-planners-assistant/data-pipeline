    "text": "11.4 Part 1(a)(i) looks to direct the majority of the borough’s growth towards the borough’s site allocations. These are sites that have been identified across a range of locations within each of the sub-areas to address the housing and employment needs of the borough as well as facilitate the delivery of key supporting infrastructure, such as publicly accessible open space, schools, and other social infrastructure. These sites are shown on the Policies Map. Further information on the detailed site-specific requirements that will inform the design, scale, and layout of new development within these allocations is set out in Section 4. 11.5 Part 1(a)(ii) aims to direct growth to highly accessible locations with good links to existing or commitment to the delivery of public transport, cycling and walking networks, and town centres in line with policies TC1 and MC1.",

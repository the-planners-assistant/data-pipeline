    "text": "area. 14.178 Part 3 aims to control the presence of unhealthy advertising in the vicinity of schools, in line with the councilâ€™s adopted healthy advertising policy. Telephone kiosks are increasingly used as a method of displaying advertising, but due to recent changes to the General Permitted Development Order are no longer considered to be permitted development and now require planning permission. Within 400m of a school, this permission will only be granted where a condition can be placed on the permission (or some other form of acceptable agreement can be reached) to not allow the advertising of high fat, salt, and sugar (HFSS) products. This is to reduce the exposure of children and young people to HFSS advertising, which can negatively impact their health. Tower Hamlets Local Plan 215 PEOPLE, PLACES AND SPACES 14.179 Part 4 of the policy also sets out general criteria for the placement of telephone kiosks. BACK TO POLICIES",

This would exceed the target score of 0.4 and therefore meet the requirements of the policy, and provide a number of benefits to the health and well-being of residents BIODIVERSITY AND OPEN SPACE 18.94 Part 3 sets out our approach to the urban greening factor in the borough. Unlike the London Plan policy, this is intended to be applied to developments of all sizes, and the non-residential approach does not exclude B2 and B8 uses. This approach is justified on the basis of the urgency of the climate crisis, its effects on biodiversity and flood risk, the presence of a large area of deficiency of access to nature in parts of the borough, and the importance of providing additional green spaces throughout the borough.",

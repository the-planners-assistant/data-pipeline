    "text": "network. 19.27 The ‘Healthy Streets Approach’ prioritises the health and wellbeing for all those who live, work, study in, and visit the borough, by putting human needs and experiences at the centre of public realm and transport design. Streets should be welcoming places where everyone feels able to spend time, engage in physical activity, or socialise with other people. Healthy streets support many types of active travel, from commuting to work, walking for pleasure, or cycling with children to school, all of which require different kinds of route. Heathy streets support vibrant and lively communities, where different groups can come together to socialise and enjoy public spaces. The design of healthy streets should have regard for other relevant best practice guidance, such as Sport England’s Active Design Guidance (2023).

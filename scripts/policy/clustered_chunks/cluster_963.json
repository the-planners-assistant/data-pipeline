    "text": "14.46 Part 5(m) relates to situations in which the delivery of tall buildings on one site could potentially harm the delivery of a similar level of density on an adjacent site if development on the first site is delivered badly. This can particularly be the case where buildings are proposed right against the boundary line of a plot, which could make it difficult for adjacent plots to achieve Local Plan requirements relating to privacy, overlooking, and daylight and sunlight. 14.47 The criteria set out in part 5 also apply to the redevelopment of existing tall buildings (including those outside the tall building zones). The presence of an existing tall building on the site will not in itself be regarded as justification for replacing it with another tall building â€“ all proposals for tall buildings will need to be justified with reference to this policy and other policies that make up the development plan.",

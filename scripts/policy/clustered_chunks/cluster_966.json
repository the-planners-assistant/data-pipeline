In order to justify the inclusion of single-aspect dwellings, development proposals will need to demonstrate that no alternative design or layout that includes a greater proportion of dual-aspect dwellings is feasible. In line with the policies in the Clean and Green Future chapter development must mitigate and adapt to climate change. Developments should incorporate overhangs, eaves, recesses, louvres or shutters to aid temperate control of internal spaces.",

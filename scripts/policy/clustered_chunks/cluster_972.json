    "text": "120 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO POLICIES For example, a light-coloured building that reflects heat will stay cool on the inside and the outside, whereas a dark building will absorb heat during the day to raise internal temperatures and slowly release this heat as the temperature cools, warming the local air temperature. Internal air-conditioning systems also produce heat which increases the outside temperature and contributes to the urban heat island effect. 13.60 Part 1 seeks to incentivise good design to minimise the risk of overheating and maximise the effectiveness of passive strategies to avoid the need for active cooling, which brings additional embodied and operation carbon emissions and increased energy costs for residents.",

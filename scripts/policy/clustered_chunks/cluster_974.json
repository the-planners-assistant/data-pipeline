    "text": "76 Tower Hamlets Local Plan BACK TO POLICIES 12.11 Part 1(d) acknowledges that the regeneration of existing housing estates will play a role in delivering the homes the borough needs. Such regeneration should not only seek to deliver an increased number of new affordable homes but to result in improved and expanded social facilities, enhancement of environmental amenity, open space and public realm that responds to the resulting increase in demand generated by the increased number of residents in the regenerated estate. Such schemes should be guided by the council’s Estate Regeneration Pathway and engage early in the design process with the council’s regeneration team.",

    "text": "HOMES FOR THE COMMUNITY 12.53 Part 1(e) requires that development proposals include provision of affordable housing. This requirement will vary based on the nature of the proposal. All development proposals for C3 housing will be required to provide affordable housing in accordance with Policy HF2. While non-C3 housing should also provide affordable accommodation, it is recognised that, due to the particular costs or nature of a facility, it may not be possible to provide the amount of affordable housing required by Policy HF2. In these cases, development proposals should demonstrate that they are providing the maximum viable amount of affordable housing. It should be noted that specialist older persons housing is eligible for the London Planâ€™s Fast Track Route for the provision of affordable housing; other types of specialist housing are excluded from the fast-track approach and typically take bespoke approaches to the provision of affordable housing.",

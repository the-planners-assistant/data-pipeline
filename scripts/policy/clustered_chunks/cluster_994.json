    "text": "into four distinct areas. The commercial core of the NIOD has been designated as the CW POL and is unsuitable for housing, unless it is delivered through the retrofit of existing buildings in line with circular economy principles and does not undermine the supply of office space to meet the objectively assessed need as demonstrated in the councilâ€™s Employment Land Review or other council-approved document, or other uses which would undermine the strategic functions of the CAZ. The area surrounding the CW POL has been designated as the CW Fringe. In this area a greater mix of uses is supported, including residential up to a maximum limit of 75% of the floor area of any new development. The 75% maximum may be considered strategically across multiple sites where appropriate. The CW Fringe is also expected to support the function of Canary Wharf as a Metropolitan Centre, with a diverse variety of town centre uses.",
